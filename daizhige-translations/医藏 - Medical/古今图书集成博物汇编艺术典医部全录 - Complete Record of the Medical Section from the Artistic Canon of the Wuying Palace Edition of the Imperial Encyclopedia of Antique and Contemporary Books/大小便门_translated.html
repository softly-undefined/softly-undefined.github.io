<p><strong>Doors of Urination and Defecation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s <em>Suwen</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>Pure Yang emerges from the upper orifices, while impure Yin exits from the lower orifices. Yin flavors come from the lower orifices, and Yang energy emanates from the upper orifices. <em>[Note: The pure Yang in a person originates from Heaven and rises through the upper orifices; the impure Yin comes from Earth and flows through the lower orifices. Flavors have substance, thus they pass through the orifice of defecation; energies are formless, hence they emerge through the orifice of respiration.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the True Organs of Jade Machine</strong></p>
<p>When winter meridians are insufficient, it causes the heart to feel anxious as if suffering from hunger; (less of the moon) in the middle becomes cold, the spine aches, the lower abdomen feels full, and urination changes. <em>[Note: The kidney is the source of vitality; when it is deficient, the water and fire energies of the heart and kidneys cannot harmonize, causing anxiety as if suffering from hunger. The insufficiency of Yang in the kidneys leads to coldness in the (less of the moon) middle. The deficiency of the kidneys&#39; transformative power results in changes in urination and fullness in the lower abdomen.]</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Transmission of Humoral Disease</strong></p>
<p>Regarding spleen diseases, the body experiences pain and heaviness. On the first day, there is distention; on the second day, there is pain in the lower abdomen, waist, spine, and aching in the shins; on the third day, there is pain in the back and muscles, and urinary obstruction. If this persists for ten days, it leads to death. In winter, this is determined by the time of the pig, indicating that earth is weakened and water is dominant. In summer, meals should be taken during the time of the tiger, as wood is strong and earth is depleted.<br>[Note: When the disease first affects the spleen, it leads to body pain and heaviness; by the first day, it reaches the stomach causing distention; by the second day, it affects the kidneys leading to lower abdomen, waist, spine pain, and shin aches; by the third day, it reaches the bladder resulting in back pain and urinary obstruction. If it lasts for ten days, it leads to death. In winter, the major time is determined by the pig, as earth is weakened and water prevails. In summer, meals should be taken later during the time of the tiger, as wood is thriving and earth is exhausted.]</p>
<p>Regarding kidney diseases, there is pain in the lower abdomen, waist, and spine, along with aches in the thighs. After three days, pain occurs in the back and there is urinary obstruction; after another three days, distention of the abdomen begins; within three days, there is pain in the sides, and if it continues for three days, it leads to death. The major time in winter is at dawn, and in summer, during the late afternoon.<br>[Note: When the disease first affects the kidneys, it causes pain in the lower abdomen, waist, and spine. After three days, it reaches the back and bladder causing pain and urinary obstruction; after three days, it leads to stomach distention; and after three days, it affects the liver causing side pain. The major time in winter is determined at the time of the dragon, as earth is strong and water is diminished. In summer, late afternoon corresponds to the pig, when water is unable to thrive.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Stomach disease causes bloating. After five days, there is pain in the lower abdomen, waist, and spine, along with leg soreness. Three days later, there is pain in the back muscles and difficulty urinating. After five days, the body feels heavy, and if this continues for six days, it results in death. In winter, this occurs after midnight; in summer, it happens in the afternoon. </p>
<p>(Note: The disease starts in the stomach, hence the bloating. After five days, it affects the kidneys, causing pain in the lower abdomen, waist, spine, and leg soreness; after three days, it affects the bladder, resulting in back muscle pain and difficulty urinating; after five days, it affects the spleen, leading to a heavy feeling in the body. &quot;In winter, after midnight&quot; indicates decay of earth and the dominance of water; &quot;in summer, during the afternoon&quot; points to a time governed by Yangming, where earth fails to generate.)</p>
<p>Bladder disease leads to difficulty urinating. After five days, there is bloating in the lower abdomen, pain in the waist and spine, and leg soreness. On one day, there is abdominal bloating; on another, body pain. If this continues for two days, it results in death. In winter, it coincides with the rooster’s crow; in summer, it occurs in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>(Note: The disease starts in the bladder, hence the difficulty urinating. After five days, it affects the kidneys, resulting in lower abdominal bloating and waist pain; on one day, it affects the stomach, causing abdominal bloating; on another day, it impacts the spleen, leading to body pain. &quot;In winter, at the rooster&#39;s crow&quot; signifies a time of the sun and lesser yang being active, where energy is exhausted; &quot;in summer, in the late afternoon&quot; denotes a period of Yangming energy also being exhausted.)<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Strange Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: There are those with a condition of frequent urination, several times a day; this signifies insufficiency. When the body feels hot like charcoal, the neck and chest are swollen, the pulse is vigorous, and there is wheezing with a reversed breath, this signifies excess. When the Taiyin pulse is as fine as a hair, this signifies insufficiency. Where does the sickness lie? What is its name? Qibo replied: The illness is in the Taiyin; its excess is in the stomach, and its deficit is in the lungs. The condition is called &quot;Jue,&quot; and if untreated, it leads to death. This is said to involve an excess in the five, and a deficiency in the two. The Emperor asked: What is meant by &quot;five excesses&quot; and &quot;two deficiencies&quot;? Qibo replied: The &quot;five excesses&quot; refer to an excess of the five diseases of qi. The &quot;two deficiencies&quot; also refer to a deficiency of qi. Now, if externally there is an excess of five, and internally a deficiency of two, then the body&#39;s condition is neither externally manifested nor internally resolved, and it is undoubtedly on the path to death.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The Yangming channel is characterized by dryness and heat, revealing the transformation of the Taiyin’s dampness. When the Taiyin is insufficient, the stomach&#39;s qi becomes hot, leading to an excessive and agitated pulse at the Renying point. When the stomach qi rises, it is closely related to the lungs, causing wheezing and reversed breathing. If the stomach qi is strong but unable to circulate the essence, it indicates a deficiency in the Taiyin. With insufficient Taiyin, all the five organs and six bowels fail to receive qi, leading to the fatal symptoms of reversed cold. </p>
<p>Conditions where there is an excess include a body feeling hot like charcoal, a feeling of heaviness in the neck and throat, an agitated pulse, and wheezing with reversed breath, which are signs of excess qi. The two deficiencies refer to frequent urination, with the Taiyin pulse being thin like a hair, indicating a lack of qi. Yangming governs the exterior; when there is excess in the five signs, it fails to circulate qi through the three Yang channels on the surface. Taiyin governs the interior; when there are two deficiencies, it fails to circulate qi through the three Yin channels internally. This disruption of the balance between the interior and exterior yin and yang in the body leads to certain death.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p>
<h3>On Reversal</h3>
<p>When the Taiyin is reversed, it leads to abdominal fullness (true moon) and distension, with difficulty in bowel movements. [Note: The channel of the foot Taiyin enters the abdomen and is connected to the spleen; thus, if it is reversed, it results in abdominal fullness (true moon) and distension. Food and drink enter the stomach, and the spleen is responsible for transformation and transport; if there is counterflow in the spleen, it causes difficulty in bowel movements.]</p>
<p>When the Shaoyin is reversed, it results in dry mouth and red urine. [Note: When the channels of the foot Shaoyin are in reversal, the lung metal cannot regulate downward, resulting in red urine.]</p>
<p>When the Jueyin is reversed, it causes swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, with abdominal distension and difficulty in urination. [Note: The channel of the foot Jueyin corresponds to the lower abdomen, involving the stomach and connecting to the liver and gallbladder; thus, reversal leads to swelling and pain in the lower abdomen and abdominal distension. It runs down to the inner thighs, enters the hair region, encircles the genitals, and reaches the lower abdomen, leading to difficulty in urination.]</p>
<p>Reversal of the Jueyin can cause back pain, fullness in the abdomen, and obstruction in the front. [Note: The waist corresponds to the exterior of the liver. Fullness indicates that the essence cannot disperse in the liver. Obstruction in the front pertains to the liver’s role in regulating flow.]</p>
<p>When all three Yin channels are reversed, it leads to inability to move forward or backward, causing cold in the hands and feet, and death in three days. [Note: When all three Yin channels are reversed, Yin is separated from Yang. The inability to move forward or backward refers to the downward aspect of Yin. All Yang energy arises from Yin; when all three Yin channels are reversed, life energy is extinguished, resulting in cold extremities and death in three days.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Secret Classic of Linglan</strong></p>
<p>The Sanjiao (Triple Burner) is the official of drainage, from which the waterways emerge.<br>[Note: The lower Sanjiao is related to the Weiyang and corresponds to Taiyang. It connects with the bladder, regulating the lower burner. If there is fullness, there is urinary retention; if there is deficiency, there is incontinence. The Sanjiao governs Qi, and when Qi transforms, water flows, thus serving as the official of drainage.] The bladder is the official of the capital city, where fluids are stored; when Qi transforms, it can be expelled.<br>[Note: The bladder is a water organ that is the gathering place for water and fluids, hence it is the official of the capital city. When water and grains enter the stomach, they are separated and refined, flowing into the bladder through the lower burner; thus, it is where fluids are stored, and when Qi transforms, water and fluids travel down and exit.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Zang Organs</strong></p>
<p>The Po Men (Door of the Corporeal Soul) also functions for the five Zang organs, and food and fluids cannot be stored for long.<br>[Note: Po Men refers to the anus. It is connected upward to the lungs, hence the name. The impurities from the five Zang organs exit from here, therefore it is considered a lower orifice of the five Zang. The corruption from the intestines and stomach flows out from here; thus it is stated that food and fluids cannot be stored for long.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Qi Rebellion</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: Among the five Zang and six Fu, what causes the interchange of cold and heat? Qi Bo replied: When the uterus transfers heat to the bladder, this leads to urinary blood.<br>[Note: The bladder is the chamber of the uterus. The Chong and Ren channels arise from within the uterus, being the sea of menstrual blood. When the uterus transfers heat to the bladder, this causes the pathogens of menstrual blood to move into the bladder, resulting in urinary blood. When there is heat, the waterways dry up, leading to urinary retention.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on the Five Constant Virtues in Governance</h3>
<p>In times of dry flow, the affliction is obstruction, as it injures the kidneys.<br><em>Note: Obstruction refers to the injury to the kidneys leading to inability to transform.</em> </p>
<h3>Explanation of the Theory of the Five Qi</h3>
<p>The affliction caused by the five qi leads to bladder dysfunction resulting in obstruction, and lack of control causing incontinence.<br><em>Note: According to the &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot;: &quot;The lower jiao (the lower energizer) is influenced by the yangming, and connects to the bladder, causing obstruction when full and incontinence when deficient. Incontinence should be treated with supplements, while obstruction should be treated with purging.</em> </p>
<h3>Major Discussion on the Six Original Constants</h3>
<p>The yangming, governing the heavens, experiences initial qi leading to yellowish-red urination.<br><em>Note: When yin is condensed externally, yang becomes stagnant internally, causing illness with red urination.</em> </p>
<h3>Discussion on Regulating the Menstruation</h3>
<p>When the body has excess, it results in abdominal distension, and there is difficulty in urination and defecation.<br><em>Note: &quot;Jing&quot; refers to feces; &quot;shou&quot; refers to urine.</em> </p>
<h3>Discussion on the Essentials of True Reality</h3>
<p>The Taiyin governs the heavens, and the dominance of dampness results in difficulty with feces.<br><em>Note: The kidneys open to both yin paths, leading to constipation.</em> The Shaoyin governs the heavens, and the dominance of heat results in changing colors of urine.<br><em>Note: The change in urine color is due to lung channel disease, as fire dominance injures the metal qi.</em> The Jueyin’s dominance shows yellowish-red urination.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: The color of urine is yellow and red, arising from wood’s excess leading to fire. When the lesser yang returns, thirst prompts drinking water and the color changes to yellow and red. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Thirst leads to drinking water; the yangming stomach becomes dry and hot. The taiyin damp earth governs the four energies; the color changes to yellow and red as fire and earth combine. When the lesser yang occupies the springs, the guest prevails, and in severe cases, the urine becomes white.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Severe cases leading to white urine indicate a disturbance affecting the yangming and taiyin primary energies. Metal governs energy; when energy transforms, it is expelled as urine. White urine signifies unprocessed energy leading to unclear urine. White stool arises from damaged earth energy.</p>
<p>In the year of the taiyin at the springs, there is pain and swelling in the lower abdomen, preventing urination.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Swelling in the lower abdomen preventing urination indicates a bladder meridian disease caused by excessive earth energy, leading to illness in the water organs. </p>
<p>In the year of the lesser yang at the springs, fire predominates, causing the populace to suffer from both red and white dysentery, lower abdominal pain, and red urine; in severe cases, there may be blood in the stool. The lesser yin mirrors the condition.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Heat damaging the blood results in red dysentery, while heat damaging the energy results in white dysentery. Heat in the lower jiao causes lower abdominal pain and red urine, and in severe cases, blood may come from urination. The fire of the lesser yin arises from water, while the fire of the lesser yang is born from the earth, thus they correspond.</p>
<p>The victorious influence of the jueyin leads to transformation into heat, causing urine to be yellow and red.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Wood’s excess leads to fire.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The victory of the Shao Yang manifests in deafness and profuse red urine.<br>   【Note: When heat is excessive in the lower body, it leads to profuse red urine.】<br>The Shao Yin at the spring, with the presence of a guest, leads to changes in urination.<br>   【Note: Changes in urination arise when water and fire interact, with fire being excessive in the lower body.】 The Tai Yin at the spring, with the presence of a guest, leads to irregular urination.<br>   【Note: This relates to the dampness in the spring, affecting the Tai Yin channel and extending internally.】 All sickness related to water and fluid that is clear and cold belongs to coldness. All disturbances and rebukes resulting in murky fluids belong to heat.<br>   【Note: Disturbance refers to confusion.】</p>
<pre><code>        Treatise on Heat
</code></pre>
<p>For those with liver heat illness, the urine first turns yellow.<br>   【Note: The liver governs the dispersal function, hence the yellowish urine.】<br>             Ling Shu Classic</p>
<pre><code>        Discussion on Pathogenic Qi and Organ Symptoms
</code></pre>
<p>A slight slippery pulse in the liver indicates incontinence.<br>   【Note: The liver governs dispersal, thus strong liver Qi leads to incontinence.】 A very slippery pulse in the spleen indicates retention of fluid or urination difficulty.<br>   【Note: The spleen is the damp earth, and when dampness and heat converge, it causes difficulty in urination.】 A slightly urgent pulse in the kidneys leads to inability to regulate urination, while a very slippery pulse indicates urinary retention.<br>   【Note: The kidneys are the source of vitality, opening to the two yin; deficiency of Qi leads to inefficiency, causing difficulty in urination and potential swelling of the testicles.】<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>On the Health Committee</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about the functions of the lower energizer? Qibo replied: The lower energizer is the section of the intestines that diverges into the small intestine, which discharges into the bladder and seeps into it. Thus, the water and grains usually coexist in the stomach, becoming dregs that descend together into the large intestine, forming the lower energizer. They seep down together, assisting in the secretion of distinct juices, traveling through the lower energizer and seeping into the bladder.</p>
<p><strong>On the Channels</strong></p>
<p>The lung hand taiyin channel is responsible for ailments arising from the lungs. When qi is abundant and excessive, there will be pain in the shoulder and back, along with wind, cold, sweating from a stroke, and frequent urination with deficiency. When qi is deficient, there will be chill and pain in the shoulder and back, shortness of breath insufficient for respiration, and changes in the color of the urine.</p>
<p>The stomach foot yangming channel, when excess in the stomach, leads to an increase in appetite and yellowish urine.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The liver corresponds to the channel of the jueyin, which governs diseases originating from the liver, such as fullness in the chest, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and conditions of urine retention or obstruction. </p>
<p>When the weather is cold, the pores close, and the qi and humidity do not circulate, causing water to flow down to the bladder, resulting in urine and qi. When qi escapes, it manifests as urine; when stored in the bladder, it becomes the latent yang qi.</p>
<p>Sour flavors travel through the tendons; excessive consumption leads to urinary retention. Sourness enters the stomach, causing its qi to stagnate, thus restraining the two upper burners, preventing the necessary exchanges. If it does not exit, it remains in the stomach, and if the stomach is harmonized and warm, it descends to the bladder. The bladder, being fragile and thin, contracts when it encounters sourness, leading to blockage, resulting in urinary retention. The yin corresponds to the accumulation of tendons, hence the sourness enters and affects the tendons. </p>
<p>The sour qi stagnates and thus cannot exit from the upper burners. If it does not exit, it stays in the stomach and seeps down to the lower burner, eventually entering the bladder. The bladder is the chamber for storage, and since it is situated in the center, its constitution is fragile and thin, making it vulnerable to contraction from sourness, leading to blockage and the failure of the water pathways, hence urinary retention. The term &quot;yin&quot; refers to the anterior yin, and &quot;accumulation of tendons&quot; signifies the primary tendons, which govern the tendons. Sourness enters the primary tendons, hence its effect on them.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Nine Needle Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The bladder failing to restrain leads to incontinence; the lower abdomen overflowing results in water.<br>[Note: If the bladder fails to contain, incontinence occurs. If the lower abdomen resembles an overflow, the water pathway emerges. If ill, it then overflows, leading to water disease.]</p>
<p><strong>Difficult Bowel Movements</strong></p>
<p>The Abdominal Distention Section states: for pain accompanied by obstruction, the prescription is Three Matters Decoction with Magnolia Bark. The Five Organs Section states: When the foot yang pulse is floating and weak, if it’s floating, then stomach Qi is strong; if it’s weak, then urination is frequent. The combination of floating and weak leads to hardened stools, indicating the spleen is constrained. The prescription is Hemp Seed Pill. The Thirst Disturbance Section states: When the foot yang pulse is rapid and there’s heat in the stomach, this will consume grain and draw in food; therefore, bowel movements must be hard, and urination will be frequent.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>
<h3>Frequent Urination</h3>
<p>The chapter on Thirst states: When the Fuyang pulse is floating and rapid, the floating indicates qi, and the rapid indicates the exhaustion of nourishment leading to hardness. When qi is abundant, urination is frequent; frequent urination results in hardness, and when hardness and frequency clash, it leads to thirst.</p>
<h3>Difficult Urination</h3>
<p>The chapter on Damp Bi states: In Sun Disease, when there is joint pain and restlessness, and the pulse is deep and thin, this is called Damp Bi. Symptoms of Damp Bi include difficult urination and rapid bowel movements, but one should treat the difficult urination.</p>
<p>The chapter on Blood Bi states: When a man has a weak, deep, and wiry pulse, without cold, heat, shortness of breath, or inner distress; difficult urination; a pale face; occasional drowsiness; bleeding; and fullness in the lower abdomen, this is caused by overexertion. For deficiency fatigue, with lower back pain, tension in the lower abdomen, and difficult urination, the Bawei Shenqi Pills should be used. </p>
<p>The chapter on Thirst states: If urination is difficult, and there is water qi present, and the person feels thirsty, the Caoshe Louqian Pills should be used. For difficult urination, the Puhui San should be used. The Huashi Baiyu San and the Fuling Rongyan Decoction should also be used. </p>
<p>When the pulse is floating with fever, and there is thirst for water, along with difficult urination, the Zhuling Decoction should be employed. </p>
<p>The chapter on Water Qi states: When there is water in the body, the whole body and face can appear yellow and swollen, the pulse is deep, and difficult urination occurs, resulting in a water-related illness. If urination occurs naturally, it indicates a loss of body fluids, hence the thirst. The Yuebishi Jiazhu Decoction should be employed.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The pulse of the foot yang should be subdued; however, it is now rapid and irregular, indicating existing heat, with a deficiency of digestion and frequent urination, yet currently unbeneficial, which suggests the onset of water retention. The cun pulse is floating and slow; a floating pulse denotes heat, while a slow pulse indicates potential. When heat and potential clash, it is called &quot;deep.&quot; The foot yang pulse is floating and rapid; a floating pulse signifies heat, and a rapid pulse indicates cessation. When heat and cessation clash, it is termed &quot;subdued.&quot; The clash of deep and subdued pulses is referred to as water. When deep, the collateral vessels are deficient; when subdued, urination becomes difficult. Deficiency and difficulty clash, causing water to move to the skin, thus it is termed water retention.</p>
<p>The shaoyin pulse is tense and deep; tension indicates pain, while depth suggests water retention, making urination challenging. If the pulse is mainly deep, it implies water presence. When the body is swollen and heavy, and the pulse indicates water disease, it results in death.</p>
<p>For those suffering from water disease, if there are small bags under the eyes, a fresh and lustrous face, a subdued pulse, and the individual experiences thirst and a distended abdomen with difficult urination, a deep cessation in the pulse indicates water, which can be purged.</p>
<p>Question: If after purging there is thirst for water, with difficult urination and abdominal fullness due to swelling, what is the reason? </p>
<p>Answer: This indicates a water disease. If urination occurs naturally along with sweating, there may be self-recovery.</p>
<p>For lung water, the body swells, urination is difficult, and there is periodic loose stool. For spleen water, the abdomen is large, the limbs are heavy, bodily fluids do not generate, there is merely shortness of breath, and urination is difficult.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The water in the kidneys manifests as a large abdomen, swollen navel, waist pain, difficulty in urination, and dampness below resembling sweat on a cow&#39;s nose. The feet are cold, and the face appears thin. </p>
<p>The teacher said: The pulse at the wrist is deep and slow; deep indicates water, and slow indicates cold. Cold water clashes, and the foot yang pulse is suppressed, food and drink are not digested, the spleen&#39;s energy declines leading to loose stools, and the stomach&#39;s energy weakens resulting in bodily swelling. The lesser yang pulse is low, and the lesser yin pulse is thin. For men, this leads to difficulty in urination; for women, it causes menstrual irregularities. The menstrual flow is blood, and if blood is not flowing well, it leads to water, referred to as &quot;blood division.&quot;</p>
<p>The student asked: The patient suffers from water retention, with swelling in the face, body, and limbs, experiencing difficulty in urination. The pulse does not describe water but instead indicates pain in the chest, with qi rising and obstructing the throat, resembling the sensation of burned flesh, and there may be slight coughing and wheezing. According to the teacher’s words, what type of pulse is present? </p>
<p>The teacher replied: The pulse at the wrist is deep and tense; deep indicates water, and tense indicates cold. Deep and tense clash, creating a blockage at the lower abdomen. Initially, this occurs mildly, but as time passes, it becomes unnoticed. After yang weakens, the nutritive and defensive energies become intermingled, yang is depleted while yin dominates, leading to a slight disturbance from cold, with kidney energy rising and causing obstruction in the throat, along with acute pain in the sides.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The physician believed that by administering a diuretic for heavy urination, the vital energy would not be dispelled and the illness would not improve. Subsequently, the patient experienced severe vomiting, a weak and troubled stomach, a dry throat with a desire to drink water, difficulties with urination, undigested food and water, and swelling in the face and limbs. Again, a diuretic was given, leading to slight improvement, but excessive eating and drinking caused the swelling to return, with pain in the chest and sides, resembling a swelling of water, causing coughing and wheezing. First, the defensive qi should be addressed to relieve symptoms before treating the cough; once the cough subsides, the wheezing will naturally improve. New illnesses must be treated first, while old ones should follow.</p>
<p>In the chapter on jaundice, it states: If the pulse at the fuyang point is tight and rapid, the rapidity indicates heat, leading to the digestion of food; tightness indicates cold, leading to fullness upon eating. A floating pulse at the chi point indicates kidney damage, while a tight fuyang pulse indicates spleen damage. When wind and cold collide, eating food can induce dizziness, and food qi cannot be digested, resulting in bitterness and turbidity in the stomach. This stagnant turbidity flows downward, causing urinary obstruction, the yin being affected by cold, and heat flowing into the bladder, resulting in the body turning yellow, which is called &quot;food jaundice.&quot;</p>
<p>In yangming disease, a slow pulse indicates difficulty in eating enough food; if fullness occurs, it leads to annoyance, dizziness, and likely difficulty in urination, suggesting the onset of food jaundice. Even with treatment, the abdomen remains full due to the slow pulse.</p>
<p>For alcohol-induced jaundice, there will certainly be difficulties with urination, accompanied by heat in the heart and heat in the feet, which are the symptoms.</p>
<p>A submerged pulse, indicating thirst with a desire for water and difficulties with urination, all suggest jaundice.</p>
<p>With jaundice manifesting as abdominal fullness, difficult and red urination, and sweating, this indicates a balance of exterior and interior symptoms. In such cases, a purgative should be administered, preferably consisting of rhubarb and Glauber’s salt decoction.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Secrets</strong><br><strong>[Jin Dynasty - Wang Shuhe]</strong></p>

<p>People may suffer from blockages after illnesses due to the change of seasons, leading to sudden death. This should not be taken lightly; therefore, it is important to detail this matter. Even if one is not gravely ill, without knowledge of medicine and dietary treatments, one may await demise helplessly, which is truly lamentable! Relying solely on remedies in haste can lead to danger. In cases of constipation, one should use oily substances and cold water to alleviate the issue. If the face appears yellow, it can be inferred that there is difficulty in bowel movements.</p>
<p><strong>Book on Keeping People Alive</strong><br><em>By Zhu Gong, Song Dynasty</em></p>
<p><strong>Constipation</strong><br>Question: If the hands and feet feel cold and there is constipation, with dark urine, or the stool is black, and the pulse is deep and slippery. Answer: This is called a yang syndrome resembling yin. Heavy yang necessitates yin, and heavy yin necessitates yang; these are changes due to cold and heat. If the hands and feet are cold, and there is constipation, with dark urine or black stool, and a pulse that is deep and slippery, these all indicate a yang syndrome. For mild cases, use Bai Hu Tang; for severe cases, use Cheng Qi Tang. If there is cold caused by febrile illness and blood flow is obstructed, resulting in cold limbs, this indicates deep lurking heat. Therefore, the condition is severe, and one should quickly use Da Cheng Qi Decoction with additional modifications, inducing sweating for immediate recovery.  </p>
<p>Heat syncope and yin syncope are different. Heat syncope involves mild syncope and heat. 如果是阴厥，没有发热，四肢逆冷，恶寒，脉沉而细，大小便滑泄。<br>Question: If someone has not had a bowel movement for several days, experiences difficulty in defecation, has hard stools, dry stools, or loose stools.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>It is said: If someone has been ill with a cold for several days without having a bowel movement, and if the stool is hard and dry, it is understood that there is heat in the body. In that case, one should use Da Chai Hu and Da Cheng Qi or Xiao Cheng Qi to address it. However, Zhang Zhongjing also discusses several types of bowel obstruction that should not be forcefully treated. </p>
<p>Zhang Zhongjing further distinguishes between Yang and Yin blockages, which should not be confused. If the pulse is floating and rapid, and the person can eat but cannot have a bowel movement, this indicates a real condition known as Yang blockage, for which Xiao Chai Hu Tang is appropriate. This is said to harmonize the Ying and Wei (nutritive and defensive) to promote the flow of fluids, so that the person may finally be able to pass stool.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the pulse is sinking and slow, the person cannot eat, feels heavy in body, and the stool is hard, this is referred to as Yin blockage, for which Jin Ye Dan is appropriate. It is said that if Yang is excessive, it leads to urgency, while excessive Yin leads to obstruction; both urgency and obstruction arise from the same cause. </p>
<p>Additionally, if asked why the stool is loose, the ancients said: When the fire of the year is insufficient, cold will prevail, causing the people to suffer from loose stools. Generally, patients with cold in the intestines will have a loose stool resembling that of a duck. The reason is that the stomach is cold, and there is no distinction between water and grain. Hua Tuo stated: Cold leads to diarrhea, while heat leads to filth. Zhang Zhongjing noted two signs of initially hard stool followed by loose stool—difficulty with urination and infrequent urination, indicating that water and grain are not being properly distinguished.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Urination</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Urination is difficult and insufficient. </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: After sweating due to a寒 (cold) illness, much bodily fluid is lost, leading to excessive dryness in the stomach, which causes difficulty in urination. When a doctor sees that urination is difficult, their tendency is often to promote it, which is a mistake. The &quot;Classified Compendium&quot; states that if the stomach is dry, there will be no urination; hence, it should not be promoted. Therefore, Zhongjing states that after purging, if sweating resumes and urination is difficult, it is merely a loss of bodily fluids. If the cold illness causes thirst, and there is heat in the lower body preventing urination, with a floating pulse, administer Wulin San; if the pulse is deep, use Zhuling Tang. If the exterior is unresolved, there is water below the heart, and symptoms include fever and cough, with fullness in the lower abdomen and difficulty urinating, use Xiao Qinglong Tang minus Mahuang and add Fuling. If there is no sweating, a sensation of heat, and strong pain in the head and neck accompanying difficult urination, administer Guizhi Tang minus Guizhi and add Fuling and Baizhu.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>If there is vomiting and fever, fullness in the chest and sides, a feeling of heaviness under the heart, and difficulty urinating, then prescribe Xiao Chai Hu Tang removing Huang Qin and adding Fu Ling. For Shaoyin disease with difficulty urinating, use Si Ni Tang with Fu Ling. In general, when there is dampness and jaundice, prioritize promoting urination. In cases of excess sweating in Yangming, exercise caution to promote urination.</p>
<p>Additionally, if asked about difficulty urinating, the answer is: it is due to Yin deficiency. When Yin is deficient, Yang will naturally rise to meet it, resulting in excess of Yang. Therefore, if the urine is yellow, there is heat in the body. One should consider herbs like Qu Mai and Hua Shi to purge this.</p>
<p>In cases where the Taiyang disease leads to sweating and persistent leakage, and the person experiences aversion to wind, difficulty urinating, slight urgency in the limbs making it hard to bend or stretch, then Gui Zhi Jia Fu Zi Tang should be administered. For Yangming wind, when the pulse is wiry and floating with shortness of breath, abdominal fullness, pain in the sides and heart, dry nose without sweating, a tendency to sleep excessively, yellowing of the body, difficulty urinating, with tidal fever and belching, Xiao Chai Hu Tang with Fu Ling should be prescribed.</p>
<p>If asked about frequent urination, it indicates that urination is unimpeded.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>It is said: When the sun is affected, there is heat in the lower burner, the lower abdomen must be full, and if there is difficulty with urination while urination is unexpectedly smooth, it indicates blood stasis, which should be treated with the &quot;抵当汤&quot; (Di Dang Decoction). In cases of Yangming syndrome, there is spontaneous sweating; if the urination is scant while urination is smooth, it indicates depletion of fluids. Even if the stool is hard, it should not be forcefully purged, but instead, honey should be used for gentle guidance. In cases of Shaoyin syndrome, if there is reversal and urination is smooth, it indicates a condition of vacuity and cold; use &quot;四逆汤&quot; (Si Ni Decoction) and &quot;真武汤&quot; (Zhen Wu Decoction) without Poria cocos. </p>
<p>Further, if one asks about frequent urination, it is said: Both the kidneys and bladder are vacuous, and external heat has invaded. When both channels are deficient, they become susceptible to external heat; in a vacuous state, they cannot control the flow of water, hence frequent urination occurs. If the urine is hot, the flow becomes problematic, leading to discomfort in urination, which causes frequent urination. Upon examination of the Fuyang pulse being rapid, if there is heat in the stomach, it leads to a consumption of grains and thirst for fluids, the stools will likely be hard, and urination will be frequent.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>In cases of yang brightness disease with spontaneous sweating, rigidity of the limbs making it difficult to bend or stretch, restlessness, and slight aversion to cold, if there is also cramping in the legs and frequent urination, it is advised not to administer cassia twig decoction; instead, one should use licorice and ginger decoction or peony and licorice decoction. Generally, if there is frequent urination, defecation will become difficult. Zhang Zhongjing states: when the pulsation at the foot yang vessel is floating and weak, floating indicates strong stomach energy, while weak indicates frequent urination; when floating and weak clash, the stool will be hard, suggesting a problem with the spleen, and the main treatment should be hemp seed pill. </p>
<p>If there is sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea after the onset of yang brightness disease, accompanied by slight restlessness, frequent urination, and hardened stools, use minor purgative decoction to resolve it. He further states: in cases of cold damage with floating pulse, spontaneous sweating, and frequent urination, if there is disharmony in the stomach causing delirium, administer a small amount of the adjusting stomach purgative decoction. </p>
<p>When asked about a condition with full body pain, fever, jaundice, difficulty with urination, and rapid bowel movements, the response is: this is called internal dampness. When wind and rain invade the weak, and mountain and marsh vapors rise, many people fall prey to internal dampness, which flows into the joints, causing body ache. The pulse will be deep and slow, indicative of internal dampness, which causes full body pain, fever, and jaundice, making urination easy; the treatment should be toasted wheat and aconite decoction. If urination remains difficult but bowel movements are rapid, the focus should be on relieving urination, and licorice and aconite decoction or five-ingredient powder should be the main treatments.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p>
<h3>Enuresis</h3>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> With a swollen abdomen and heavy body, difficult to turn over, numbness in the mouth, facial dirtiness, delirium, and enuresis. </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a condition of the three yangs combined; Baihu Decoction is the main treatment. Sweating is not advisable, as it leads to delirium; purging will cause sweating on the forehead and coldness in the hands and feet. If there is spontaneous sweating, Baihu Decoction should be augmented with ginseng.<br>— From Hejian&#39;s Six Writings by Liu Wanshu</p>
<h3>Constipation</h3>
<p>Closed bowels create blockage, leading to hard stools. When heat consumes the bodily fluids, the stool becomes hard and the large intestine becomes dry and constricted. This is called wind-heat blockage, where excessive fire restrains metal, failing to balance wood, causing the liver wood to thrive excessively. Thus, if the stool is loose yet blocked, it indicates dryness and heat outside the intestines while damp heat is within, similar in principle to post-diarrhea heaviness. The transfer of heat from the large and small intestines is named &quot;li jia.&quot; When the fluids are consumed and unable to lubricate, they accumulate and the large intestine becomes blocked. Areca nut is the main remedy for this. </p>
<p>If there is pain in the lower abdomen with inability to defecate or urinate, this indicates that pathogenic qi has entered and is obstructing, preventing the movement of food qi. Zhike Pills are indicated for this. </p>
<p>For pain in the lower abdomen and bladder tenderness on palpation, if warmth exacerbates the pain during urination, and clear nasal discharge occurs frequently, it indicates that the Taiyang channel is unimpeded, allowing qi to enter from the crown, circulate to the brain, and drain into the nose, resulting in continual nasal discharge. Shen Zha Decoction is the remedy. </p>
<p>If after eating one feels as if still hungry, the stomach heat can digest grain. The Yangming channels are disturbed, with heart fire ascending, causing heart discomfort, a yellowish pale complexion, and painful, red, and constricted urination.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Dryness</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;True Words of the Golden Chamber&quot; states: The northern (element) is black, entering and influencing the kidneys, opening to the two yin (orifices), and storing essence in the kidneys. It also states: The kidneys govern bowel movements. When bowel movements are difficult, one should treat the lesser yin. The kidneys control the five bodily fluids; when the fluids are moist, bowel movements are normal. If one was to eat irregularly, overexert themselves, damage the stomach&#39;s energy, or consume pungent, hot, and rich foods that support the fire pathogen, this will lurk in the blood, deplete true yin, and cause deficiency in bodily fluids, thus leading to constipation and dryness. However, the condition of dryness is not uniform; there is heat dryness, wind dryness, yang constipation, and yin constipation. Additionally, there are cases of elderly individuals with qi deficiency and insufficient fluids leading to dryness. The treatment principle states: The kidneys dislike dryness; one should urgently consume the pungent to moisten them. For constipation, one must disperse it. If the lesser yin is unable to have a bowel movement, one should use pungent substances to moisten it.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>The lunar (yin) energy should not be purged harshly; instead, it should be resolved with bitterness. For energetic blockages (yang), disperse them, and for yin blockages, warm them. Zhongjing states that if there is a slight ease in bowel movement but stool is hard, one must refrain from forceful purging. Use the Spleen-Restraining Pill to moisten it. If food damages the lunar energy, causing abdominal fullness and inability to digest, accompanied by rumbling and inability to have a bowel movement, one should use bitter herbs to purge it. If blood is dry and one cannot have a bowel movement, use peach kernels and wine-prepared rhubarb to promote passage. If wind causes dryness leading to constipation, use hemp seeds added to rhubarb for relief. If there is stagnation of qi causing an inability to pass stool, use (wood-fragrant) jujube seeds, bitter orange, and soapwort seeds to moisten it. Generally, treating illnesses must investigate their source; one should not indiscriminately use castor beans or morning glory seeds to purge, as this damages bodily fluids, exacerbating dryness and blockages. Thus, further purging leads to more blockages, ultimately resulting in dire situations where nothing can be done. Ah! Caution is crucial!<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The passage discusses the regulation of bodily functions and the impact of internal imbalances on the ability to urinate. </p>
<p>When the Yang energy descends from the heavens and moves through the Yin pathway, it corresponds to the western atmosphere and is connected to the intake of rich food, leading to its release. However, when the energy reaches its extreme, the Yin pathway becomes obstructed and closes off the lower passage, resulting in an inability to urinate. This indicates that the heavenly energy is unable to flow downwards. If this energy were to go against its natural course and ascend instead, it would disrupt the Yang pathway, causing stagnation in the blood vessels. Consequently, the pulse at the person’s neck would be strong and four times as prominent as the pulse at the breathing point, signaling that turbid energy is flowing in the opposite direction, hence it is referred to as &quot;the barrier.&quot;</p>
<p>In cases of alcoholic toxicity where urine is red and scant, the remedy of Wuling Powder is appropriate. If heat resides in the middle burner and has not yet affected the source of Yang, urination may be smooth and clear, indicating that bodily fluids are circulating correctly. If using Wuling Powder assists in urination, it would lead to a significant depletion of kidney water. Not only would this deplete kidney water, but it would also fail to remove the heat of alcoholic toxicity, thereby causing obstruction in both upward and downward pathways, which can lead to symptoms of jaundice. If it penetrates the blood chamber, it may result in blood stasis.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Origin of Urination</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked me: The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that food and drink reside together in the stomach, transforming into a residue that flows down into the large intestine and forms the lower energizer. They seep down, refining and separating fluids, calling upon the lower energizer to flow into the bladder. Wang Bing explains that the water and fluids from the small intestine seep and enter the bladder, where they are transformed into urine and expelled. Yang Jie notes that the food and drink in the small intestine are received at the ileocecal junction for separation. The water then seeps into the bladder’s upper opening, resulting in urination. When reviewing these three explanations, it is clear that urination is simply the fluid that is refined and seeps into the bladder to be expelled. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: Water consumed in the stomach creates essence and energy, which ascends to the spleen; the spleen’s energy then disperses essence back to the lungs, regulating the water pathway to the bladder. Thus, urination appears to be the refined essence from water drinks, which rises to the spleen and lungs, undergoing transformation before becoming urine. These perspectives differ; upon what principle shall we rely? I say we rely on reasoning. Moreover, what exactly is urination? It is merely water. The nature of water is to flow downward. Therefore, when consumed, even though its essence and energy may rise, the original substance of the drink cannot ascend.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>If it cannot rise, how can it be said that urination is solely a product of vaporization? It is only because it cannot rise that it must rely on that which can rise to lead it, which is why it is also said: the bladder stores fluids; vaporization enables it to exit. Furthermore, water is the offspring of air, and air is the mother of water; when air moves, water moves; when air is stagnant, water is stagnant. Some say that urination purely results from secretion, not from transformation, but they do not understand this principle. Nevertheless, the bladder is indeed the reservoir for fluids; it has a membrane and contains fluids within. Hence it is also said: the membrane transfers heat to the bladder. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: the membrane of the bladder is thin and delicate. The &quot;Classified Compendium&quot; states: the bladder is the chamber of the membrane. Moreover, the membrane resides in the bladder, having an upper opening but no lower opening. When fluids accumulate within the membrane, they cannot escape on their own, but must be vaporized; only then can they gradually moisten outside the membrane, accumulate in the empty space below the membrane, and consequently form urine that exits through the front passage. What the &quot;Plain Questions&quot; indicates about the bladder storing fluids encompasses the bladder as well as the membrane. Should one say that there is no empty space below the membrane, then how can a person hurry to the toilet when the urge to urinate arises? It is only when the empty space below the membrane is filled to capacity that one cannot contain it any longer, leading to an urgent need to go to the toilet. To claim that the membrane has a lower opening but no upper opening, or that it has openings both above and below, or that it has small orifices that serve as drainage routes, is indeed absurd!<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Danxi Heart Method by Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p>Dryness and Stagnation</p>
<p>When dryness leads to stagnation and there is little blood, it cannot provide nourishment. Therefore, it is essential to nourish Yin.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>In general, the refined flavors of human beings nourish the organs; the impure aspects of various Yang energies pertain to the large intestine. The large intestine is responsible for expelling waste rather than retaining it. Now, if accumulation occurs without diversion, why is this so? There must be a reason. If pathogens invade internally, the stomach becomes dry and constipated, and if the triple burner is beset by heat, the body fluids dry up; this is the heat retained in the large intestine. A person with deficiency has cold organs and depleted blood vessels, while an elderly person has cold organs and sluggish airways; this is the cold retained in the large intestine. There could also be cases of the intestines and stomach being affected by wind, leading to dryness and constipation due to wind influence. If the qi does not descend and the digestive pathway is obstructed, if there is counterflow and fullness in the chest, there must be a corresponding condition.</p>
<p>On the discussion of the &quot;Spleen Constraint Pill&quot;</p>
<p>Cheng Wuyi stated: The term &quot;constraint&quot; refers to both binding and restricting. When the stomach is strong but the spleen is weak, it limits the distribution of fluids, instead only passing them to the bladder, resulting in frequent urination and hard stools; hence it is called spleen constraint. This pill, by alleviating the dryness and constraint in the spleen, moistens the intestines and transforms bodily fluids into the stomach, thereby achieving great ease in bowel movements and reducing urination for healing. However, I have doubts. It has been said that if there is spleen constraint, the spleen&#39;s weakness prevents movement. A weak spleen signifies a deficiency of the earth element. This must be due to the dispersion of spleen qi and the depletion of spleen blood. Tracing its origin, it arises after prolonged illness, severe diarrhea, or excessive sweating, leading to the depletion of yin blood and the internal burning of fire, injuring the vital energy and also harming the spleen, thus creating this condition. When the vital energy is harmed, the lung metal element suffers from fire&#39;s attack, and qi can no longer be contained; when the spleen is harmed, since the lungs are considered the offspring of the spleen, the depletion of the lungs leads to the exhaustion of bodily fluids, inevitably stealing maternal qi for self-preservation. When metal is consumed, wood becomes scarce and vulnerable; thus, the earth element cannot avoid injury.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>When the spleen fails to transform and transport, and the lungs lose their function of conduction, it leads to constipation and difficulty in bowel movements, while urination becomes frequent and unable to retain fluids. It is proper to nourish yin and blood, so that the solitary yang fire does not become excessive, and the metal can clear and control the wood pathogens. The spleen must be healthy and able to circulate fluids, as when fluids enter the stomach, the intestines become moist and passages are opened. </p>
<p>Currently, using rhubarb as the main ingredient, along with bitter orange and magnolia bark as the assistants, although peony helps nourish the blood and sesame and apricot kernels provide warmth and moisture, if used in cases of significant heat and solid qi, nothing will be stable. I fear that for people from the northwest with abundant earth energy and robust constitution, they may be able to use this. However, for those in the southeast with internal heat and weak blood and qi, though temporary relief may be achieved, it will only lead to a weaker and drier spleen. Future users of this formula must understand that in the northwest, the focus should be on unblocking, whereas in the southeast, it should focus on moistening and relieving dryness. One must be careful not to be rigid in their approach.</p>
<p>Regarding the prohibitions related to opening the bowels, I have observed that ancient formulas for relieving constipation all utilize downward-moving herbal preparations. This is because if lung qi does not descend, the bowels are reluctant to move, thus ingredients like apricot kernel, bitter orange, agarwood, and myrobalan are employed. Furthermore, for the elderly, the weak, or those with wind conditions who lack fluids and are constipated, herbs that provide lubrication are necessary, such as sesame, hemp seeds, and donkey-hide gelatin. If one rashly uses harsh purgative drugs to forcefully expel, the fluids will be depleted, and qi and blood will be consumed, leading to temporary relief but resulting in future constipation and the onset of other illnesses. </p>
<p>In the past, Wang Shaofu suffered from this illness, and there were others who treated him with harsh medicines, ultimately resulting in his lung atrophy, coughing up blood and pus, which eventually led to his death from obstruction.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Incontinence of Urination</p>
<p>Incontinence of urination is associated with heat or weakness. For heat, apply Wuling San with detoxifying ingredients. For weakness, use Wuling with Siwu. Incontinence can be differentiated into weakness with heat or weakness with cold. For those with internal cold and spontaneous sweating, use Miyuan Dan or Sanyin Jiuzi Wan. For those with internal damp-heat, use Liu Wei Wan or Ba Wei Wan with Du Zhong, Gu Zhi, and Wu Wei. The elderly should ideally reduce Ze Xie in Ba Wei Wan. </p>
<p>In reviewing Lu&#39;s &quot;Mirror of Medicine,&quot; I noticed that this particular remedy has several ingredients in common; only the preparation of Cinnabar differs, and treatments vary. The condition treated here is frequent urination without control, accompanied by forgetfulness and persistent dreams. Noting these differences and investigating them thoroughly, one finds that this treatment method may not yield results. </p>
<p>Moreover, generally speaking: the classics state that the kidneys govern the bowels, while the liver governs urination and micturition. The &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states that the small intestine corresponds to the red intestine. Hence, both the redness of the face and the color of the urine derive from the heart and the small intestine, with the southern region displaying red externally. The classics describe the lower burner as a drain, referring specifically to the excretion of both urine and feces. Feces are yang, representing tangible transformation and thus belong to the lower burner. The kidneys are considered to govern feces, without mentioning the large intestine, indicating that disturbances in this area are deemed renal disorders. Urination is yin, representing intangible transformation, and thus belongs to the upper aspect of the lower burner. The liver is considered to govern urination and micturition, also indicating disturbances in this context are regarded as issues of the bowel. All intangible transformations are under the governance of the bowels.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>All entities with physical forms and vital energies are governed by organ diseases. When both conditions occur in the lower regions, they are the same, but whether they are tangible or intangible, and whether they relate to the bowels or the organs, varies. This is all due to the decline of the elixir field. The heart fire is not mentioned because its attendant fire carries out the edicts of the ruler. If we analyze further, the water of the bladder (associated with the yin) conquers the fire of the small intestine (associated with the yang); hence, it does not transmit to the yin, resulting in blood leakage. Blood leakage and excess urination are due to tangible physical maladies, and since it does not transfer to the yin, the yin remains unaffected. What is a tangible illness? This pertains to the substance of the yin and the function of the bowels. The interplay of heaven and earth, yin and yang, mutually defines substance and function, as can be observed. Thus it is clear that the five organs are utilized by the six bowels while the six bowels are also utilized by the five organs. All tangible matters ultimately relate to the transmission of the yin. Incontinence of urine and feces is due to the bladder&#39;s failure to retain, resulting in involuntary urination, which does not transmit to the yin. This is caused by the cold affecting the elixir field, being overcome by the water element (associated with the bladder). Generally, all bowels bear tangible forms, and tangible illnesses are found within the bowels, while the responsibility lies within the organs. The use of subdued fire and cinnabar serves merely to eliminate cold properties. The treatment methods are similar because they both reside in the lower regions, nourishing the intangible, as they are all within the elixir field; this is due to their connection to each other. The kidney governs defecation, and the liver governs urination. How can the treatments not be different? The classics state: the kidneys and liver are treated as one. It also states: the lesser yang governs the bones, and the resultant illnesses lead to difficulties in urination and defecation. The bladder governs the muscles, and the resulting illnesses can be understood likewise. For incontinence of urine, administer Poria Decoction. For incontinence of feces, administer Rice Drink.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Urinary Obstruction</p>
<p>Urinary obstruction can result from qi deficiency or blood deficiency, as well as phlegm and wind blocking, or from excess heat. For qi deficiency, one should first take ginseng, astragalus, and cimicifuga, and then induce vomiting, or induce vomiting with them mixed in the medicine. For blood deficiency, one can first take the Four Substance Decoction and then induce vomiting, or induce vomiting with liquoric and angelica blend. If there is an excess of phlegm, one should first take the Erchen Decoction and then induce vomiting. All of the above should use induced vomiting. If phlegm and qi are blocked, the Erchen Decoction should be prepared with muxiang and cyperus to help raise qi; when qi rises, water will naturally descend, as qi bears the water. For those with excess heat, it should be regulated; a syrup of sugar mixed with a few grams of morning glory root, or similar substances such as gardenia should be used. When there is heat and dampness, and qi is blocked below, it is important to clear, dry, and lift. The kidneys govern water, and the bladder is their organ. Water is retained in the bladder and is expelled through the small intestine, as they are interconnected.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>The small intestine uniquely responds to the heart; why is this so? It is because yin cannot exist without yang, and water cannot exist without fire. When water and fire are balanced, they interact up and down, thus enabling the flow of nourishment and defense, while the water passages open and close, preventing loss of their function. However, when the heart and kidneys do not interact, and yin and yang are out of balance, internal and external pathways are obstructed, leading to water retention and loss of proper function, thus causing the water path to become slippery. If there is excess heat, urination is obstructed entirely. With slight heat, urination becomes difficult and barely occurs. When both the kidneys and bladder are deficient, external heat can take over, hence they cannot regulate water. Water mixed with heat leads to slippery conditions, resulting in frequent urination with residual dribbling. When both the kidneys and bladder are cold and internal energy is insufficient, the passages become too loose, resulting in excessive output that is pale in color, which becomes more pronounced during the night when yin is stronger. The slippery nature of urination should also be addressed by adjusting the Qi.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Medical Classic: A True Account by Yu Tuan (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secret Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The northern region is associated with the color black, which connects to the kidneys, opens through the two lower orifices, and stores essence in the kidneys. The kidneys govern the five liquids; thus, when the kidneys are functioning well, bodily fluids are sufficient, and bowel movements are moist. When the kidneys are deficient, bodily fluids are depleted, leading to dry and hardened stools. This condition arises mainly from overindulgence in sexual activity and irregular dietary habits. Excessive consumption of alcohol and spicy foods can ignite heat in the spleen and stomach, while the heat from excessive desires arises from the life gate, resulting in an overabundance of fire and depletion of water, leading to insufficient production of bodily fluids. Consequently, there may be symptoms of dryness from wind, heat, or the stagnation of energy; additionally, aging and blood deficiency can lead to dryness of bodily fluids, or due to loss of blood, there may be extreme depletion of fluids. Such variations make it difficult to draw a single conclusion. The classic states: The kidneys despise dryness; thus, one should urgently consume spicy foods to moisten them and bitter foods to drain them. For yang stagnation, scatter it; for yin stagnation, warm it.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>For treating severe dryness, one should use ingredients like rhubarb, angelica, peach kernel, hemp seed, and (wooden) jujube kernel. For wind dryness, add materials such as saposhnikovia, notopterygium, gentiana, and soapberry. These should be made into pills with honey, aiming to moisture dryness and assist the movement, thus resolving blockages and promoting flow. Additionally, one should often take tonics for blood and fluid production to support the true yin and solidify the foundation, so as to avoid a recurrence of blockages. Never resort to harsh purgatives like croton seed or morning glory seeds. While this may provide temporary relief, it will inevitably lead to worse blockages and create a root of illness that becomes difficult to treat. If there is blood deficiency, with a pulse like a scallion stalk, fever, and dry, hard stools, one must absolutely avoid inducing sweat; doing so would deplete vital fluids, leading to closures that could be fatal—this would be akin to killing the patient. The &quot;Living Person&#39;s Book&quot; describes a condition of spleen constraint where the stomach is strong but the spleen is weak, restricting the fluids that cannot spread evenly, resulting only in the bladder receiving them, causing frequent urination and difficult bowel movements. The constraint must be resolved by using pills that address spleen deficiency, thereby lubricating the intestines to transform blockages and allowing fluids to flow into the stomach for recovery.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Frequent Red and Turbid Urination</p>
<p>When there is excessive sweating and the urine is red and turbid, this is often seen during the hot months. In the heat of summer, one drinks a lot, yet the urine becomes concentrated and red, as fluid accumulates in the upper body from drinking, and it is released outward through sweat. This obstruction in the fluid pathways causes the small intestine to be blocked, preventing proper downward movement of water. </p>
<p>The formula Wuling San, also known as Daoni, contains ingredients such as Atractylodes and Cinnamon to reduce sweat, while Polyporus, Alisma, and Poria work to regulate the water pathways, drawing out what is outside to the inside, allowing for elimination. What needs to be reduced is gathered, and what is obstructed is opened—this is the principle behind it. </p>
<p>However, in cases of deficiency leading to excessive sweating and red, turbid urine, it indicates that the internal organs are dried up. Once the nourishing essence is depleted, the body cannot produce fluids, leading to the turbid and red urine. It is inadvisable to excessively use diuretics, as they will drain kidney fluids. Instead, one should focus on warming and nourishing the lungs, selecting remedies such as Shi Quan Da Bu Tang or Yang Rong Tang.</p>
<p>Sweat is a fluid of the heart. The heart governs blood, and nourishing the blood ensures the heart is nurtured. When sweating stops, fluids are generated naturally, without needing to rely on urination for cleansing. Those who have lost blood or are suffering from abscesses and toxins, and suddenly experience red and turbid urine, are also experiencing dryness and lack of moisture.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Key Points of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Constipation</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of constipation: wind constipation, cold constipation, qi constipation, and heat constipation. Additionally, elderly individuals may experience dryness of bodily fluids, which is termed a deficiency condition. Women may face constipation due to postpartum blood loss, sweating, or frequent urination; in cases where the blood and qi have not yet recovered after illness, this can also lead to constipation. All cases are suitable for using Ma Ren Wan (Hemp Seed Pill).</p>
<p>Wind constipation is caused by the wind affecting the lungs and spreading to the large intestine, making transformation difficult. Individuals with a history of wind ailments often experience constipation. It is advisable to use Xiao Xu Ming Tang (Minor Continuation of Life Decoction) with the amount of Fu Zi (Aconite) reduced and the amount of Shao Yao (Peony Root) increased, and to add approximately two shells of bamboo juice. For those with excess, take Ma Ren Wan; for those with deficiency, take Yang Zheng Dan (Nourishing Upright Elixir).</p>
<p>Cold constipation occurs due to cold air obstructing the intestines and stomach, condensing yin and causing a blockage of fluids. When the stomach is obstructed, individuals experience gas in the intestines and tend to prefer warmth while disliking cold. It is advised to use Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San (Agastache Correct Qi Powder) with equal parts of Zhi Ke (Bitter Orange) and Guan Gui (Cinnamon), and take half of a sulfur pill. </p>
<p>Heat medicine often leads to constipation; only sulfur is warming and promotes bowel movement. Cold medicines usually cause diarrhea; only Huang Lian (Coptis) is effective for stopping diarrhea by nourishing the intestines. Qi constipation arises from a failure of qi to rise and fall, leading to stagnation of food qi, often resulting in belching. The remedy includes Su Zi Jiang Qi Tang (Perilla Seed Decoction for Descending Qi) with added Zhi Ke and Yang Zheng Dan, or a half sulfur pill, or Lai Fu Dan (Turnip Pill). If these do not work, consider adding Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan (Aucklandia and Areca Nut Pill).<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>To achieve rapid relief, use bitter orange peel. </p>
<p>In cases of heat constipation, with symptoms like a red face, body heat, abdominal bloating, occasional desires for coolness, or sores on the mouth and tongue, these arise from heat accumulation in the large intestine. It is advisable to take a cooling drink and swallow intestinal pills, or use a pill with agarwood and betel nut. If there&#39;s pain with gas, and the large intestine is obstructed, using a laxative will not help. If there is more of a wind-like blockage, forcing intake to relieve it may result in a recurrence of the blockage. In cases where blood is expelled alongside, one should focus on regulating the qi; once the qi flows smoothly, relief will follow. The method to regulate qi should also seek warm remedies. </p>
<p>There have been instances where purgative herbs like bitter bean failed to work, while using Dan and Fu successfully led to relief; this knowledge is essential. </p>
<p>For elderly individuals experiencing weak constipation, with symptoms like sweating, excessive urination, and lingering issues after illness, it is advisable to use a modified Suzi Qiangqi Decoction with increased doses of Gui and Weilingxian pill, or to consider Rouhuang drink or Condon broth for intestinal regulation. </p>
<p>For food stagnation causing blockage, resulting in abdominal bloating, gas, and a feeling of fullness in the chest, it is recommended to use Gan Ying Pills with bitter bean. </p>
<p>In general, if medications for constipation do not work, or if there are other symptoms preventing effective treatment, use honey and soap pod as a guide. For cold-related constipation, ginger can also be an effective guide.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Closed Urination</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, this condition, known as &quot;lóng,&quot; means to cease. It occurs when there is obstruction; not passing urine is referred to as losing it. If urination is painful, dripping, and lingering, it is called &quot;lín.&quot; If the urge to urinate is urgent but blocked, it is termed &quot;closed.&quot; One should take Wu Ling San or Deng Xin Tang as adjustments. This condition is often prevalent in hot months, and the original medicine should be prescribed. </p>
<p>When there is obstruction and the lower abdomen feels bloated, it is diagnosed as closed lóng. One should use Deng Xin Tang to adjust with Wu Ling San, or prepare a wash with Ci Tang mixed with powdered amber; additionally, one should place salt in the lower abdomen and apply water. If cooling medicine does not work, it may be due to chilling stagnation. In such cases, one should apply roasted salt to the lower abdomen, or use Ci Tang for steam washing. </p>
<p>If there is abdominal urgency with blocked urination, the more one uses laxatives, the worse it gets. It is advisable to fill the navel with salt and then burn moxa directly on the salt for better effect.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>Frequent Urination</p>
<p>Excessive urination indicates deficiency and coldness in the lower yuan, with the kidneys failing to retain water, leading to leakage. Suitable remedies include Tu Si Zi Wan, Ba Wei Wan, Yuan Tu Dan, and Sheng Liao Lu Rong Wan. Some people urinate four times between morning and noon daily, yet they have no other issues; this is caused by kidney deficiency. It is similar to the spleen and kidney deficiency where there is early leakage but late recovery, recurring the next day. </p>
<p>If urination is often urgent, although the frequency may be high, the amount is typically small. After urinating, urgency returns quickly without pain—this is not a case of dysuria. It may also happen that after urination, there is a sudden need to urinate again, often due to holding back urine or during sexual activity. For this, reduce half of the Ze Xie in Sheng Liao Wu Ling San and add one qian of E Jiao, then take Ba Wei Wan. This pill must contain Wu Wei Zi.</p>
<p>Those who wet the bed while asleep are also experiencing coldness in the lower yuan, resulting in unrestrained urination. For this, take Da Tu Si Zi Wan and boil crushed pig bladder for decoction.</p>
<p>If excessive joy leads to frequent urination, day and night without restraint, it indicates that extreme happiness harms the heart, which is connected to the small intestine in mutual correspondence. A remedy is to blend equal parts of Qing Drink and Si Qi Tang for decoction; also, take Chen Sha Miao Xiang San and swallow small Tu Si Zi Wan or Yuan Tu Dan.</p>
<p>Uncontrollable urination that occurs without awareness, with red urine indicating heat, while white urine hints at qi deficiency.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Ming Medicine Miscellaneous Writings by Wang Lun</strong></p>
<p><strong>Frequent Urination</strong></p>
<p>Frequent or uncontainable urination is often attributed to cold by ancient prescriptions, leading to the use of warming, astringent medicines. However, it should be understood that this condition can also belong to heat, in which case it is due to the chaotic movement of bladder fire, preventing water from stabilizing, resulting in frequent urination. Hence, elderly individuals frequently experience this condition due to a lack of bladder blood and excessive yang fire. The treatment should primarily involve replenishing the bladder&#39;s yin blood and dispelling the heat evil, complemented with astringent remedies such as oyster shell, cornelian cherry, and Schisandra fruit. Warming medicines should be avoided. The disease fundamentally stems from heat, thus heat should be dispelled. Additionally, insufficient water leads to active fire, causing increased urination. With frequent urination, water becomes even more depleted. Therefore, it is essential to replenish blood and dispel fire to treat the underlying issue, while using astringent measures to address the symptoms.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Medical Compendium</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Urinary Retention</strong></p>
<p>Urinary retention, broadly speaking, is one disease that can be divided into two distinct types: acute and chronic. The acute form occurs when there is sudden inability to urinate, known colloquially as urinary obstruction. The chronic form refers to persistent difficulty urinating, where drops trickle out multiple times a day, often called dysuria.</p>
<p>When there is urinary obstruction, pain is felt in the lower abdomen, similar to the sensation of a bowl turned upside down—painful and difficult to endure. This condition arises because the intestines and stomach are dried up, and the qi in the chest does not descend. As stated in the classics: &quot;The bladder is the government of the region, where fluids are stored; when qi is transformed, it can be released.&quot; The chest area is overseen by the ministerial fire and the kidneys serve as the sea of qi. Wang&#39;s commentary states: &quot;The bladder is an organ of fluids, located within the lower abdomen, between the hairs of the lower belly. If the qi of the sea is allowed to transform, then urination will be smooth. If the qi is insufficient, there will be obstructions, and thus relief cannot be attained.&quot;</p>
<p>To treat this condition, use three qian each of clove and sandalwood, mixed with wine, or use the Eight Correcting Powder. In severe cases, it is advisable to stimulate upwards to facilitate the passage of qi, leading to natural relief. As mentioned in the classics: &quot;If the disease is in the lower part, take measures from above.&quot; Wang&#39;s commentary further explains: &quot;Heat attacking from above hinders below. When qi is abundant above, use warming and dispersing agents, and rely on bitter herbs to assist in relief.&quot;</p>
<p>If the lower abdomen is painful and distended, giving a sensation of fullness, there are two methods of treatment: if qi is stagnant below, employ vomiting techniques to lift it; if there is blood stasis below, use substances like桃仁 (peach kernel) to break it up.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Unfavorable Conditions</p>
<p>The texts state: The kidneys connect with the bladder, and the bladder is the organ for fluids. The small intestine is associated with the kidneys, which are connected to the lungs; hence, they are considered two organs. The Sanjiao (Triple Burner) is the organ of the central duct, where fluids are produced. It is associated with the bladder, which is an organ of the kidneys. It also states: The bladder is the official governing the provinces, where fluids are stored; when they are vaporized, they can be released. From this, we understand that the bladder stores water, and the Sanjiao releases water. To treat difficult urination, therefore, acupuncture and moxibustion methods focus only on the Sanjiao points, not the bladder. The small intestine is related to the kidneys and lungs; hence Dongyuan uses Qingfeiyin (Clear Lung Decoction) and Zhirenwan (Kidney Nourishing Pill) to promote urination.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine by Li Zhan (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dry and Hard Stools</strong></p>
<p>Dryness can be categorized as wind-dryness, heat-dryness, fire-dryness, and qi and blood deficiency-dryness, which are detailed in the section on dryness. Hardness can be classified as yang hardness, where one can feel the pulse strongly, and yin hardness, where the pulse is weak and thin; there are also cases of aging with qi and blood deficiency. Dryness relates to the deficiency of yin fluids in the lesser yin organs, which can be moistened with pungent herbs. Hardness relates to the greater yin being associated with dry feces, which can be purged with bitter herbs. After a hardness has occurred, one should continue to take blood-nourishing and fluid-generating medicines to prevent recurrence and to avoid further harm to the original energy.</p>
<p>For damp-heat problems with fullness in the heart and abdomen, and with accumulated worms, one can use Borneo nut pills. When dryness and hardness occur sporadically, it indicates a real condition; when it is constant, it indicates a虚 (insubstantial condition). In cases complicated by toxins from drugs and stones, with urinary retention and abdominal distension, one can use Sanhe Powder combined with Sanhuang Decoction. In cases of food poisoning, one can use Xianglian Pills. If there is stomach fire, Baihu Decoction is appropriate. </p>
<p>Deficiency of fluids can arise from excessive sweating, overuse of diuretics, and postpartum blood loss. When blood is desiccated, one can use Wuren Pills, Shenqi Pills, or Dashengxie Pills, or Dai Zhi Tong You Decoction mixed with Borneo nut, Coptis, and dried tangerine peel. For qi deficiency, one can use Shenren Pills or Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. For those affected by emotional disturbances, Guocongchen Pills may be helpful. </p>
<p>Cold in the organs leads to qi stagnation, and cold in the organs leads to blood desiccation.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>For those with cold-induced stagnation or phlegm accumulation, the ancient Half-Sulfur Pill, Ancient Ginger and Aconite Decoction, and Wujisan are recommended, paired with something cold. Although these conditions may require yang medicine, if there&#39;s constipation, one should temporarily use a laxative to gently encourage movement without causing blockage.</p>
<p>In cases of emotional stagnation and heaviness, use Sanhe Powder or Liumo Decoction. For a floating pulse with difficulty in daytime bowel movements, Chenpi and Xingren can be prepared in honey pills; for a sinking pulse with difficulty at night, use Taoren instead. </p>
<p>For phlegm stagnation, Erchen Decoction with Zhiqiao and Binglang is effective. For heat injuries, use Sanhuang Pill. For cold damage, consider Dingxiang Pizhi Pill or the emergency Dahuang Preparation. If there is spleen and stomach fire, use Runchang Pill.</p>
<p>For dry obstructions, apply treatments that promote lung qi, as the lungs and large intestines are interconnected. Zhiqiao Decoction with Zisu, or Suzi Jiangqi Decoction, or porridge made from Suzi and Mairen can be effective. Additionally, in cases of spleen deficiency where the stomach is strong but the spleen weak, causing fluids to be trapped and difficult to distribute, this leads to frequent urination and difficult bowel movements, explaining the need for Spleen Deficiency Pills.</p>
<p>However, since the spleen is yin, excessive heat can consume it, causing the lungs to lose their ability to transform and transport, hence nourishing yin and replenishing blood is crucial. For strong individuals in the northwest, Spleen Deficiency Pills can relieve blockage; in contrast, those in the southeast with qi and blood deficiency should focus on moisture and nourishment.</p>
<p>Methods such as applying hot or cold compresses, immersion up to the navel, or using sesame oil for medicinal purposes are beneficial.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Difficulty of Urination</strong></p>
<p>The classic text states: When the bladder is not functioning properly, it leads to urine retention. If the nostrils are yellow in color, urination will be difficult. The kidneys govern water, storing it in the bladder and releasing it into the small intestine, which are interconnected. However, the kidneys correspond to the heart; if heart fire is excessive, it leads to heat and stagnation in the small intestine. If the heat is mild, urination becomes difficult with minimal output; if the heat is severe, urination may cease completely. The treatment should focus on clearing heat and generating fluids, using such formulas as Shibu San and Wu Ling San. If there is distension below the navel, add amber; alternatively, prepare an amber powder into honey pills, or decoct ginseng and poria to take. For those who notice improved bowel movements but still experience difficulty urinating, use Ba Zheng San with added aromatic wood. If there&#39;s severe pain in the urethra due to excessive heat, use Dao Chi San with added gardenia and rhubarb, or take Ma Zi Ren Wan, along with heat-cooling compress methods.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>For those suffering from prolonged illness with spontaneous sweating, internal dryness, and excessive blood loss from ulcers, use the Ginseng Nourishing Decoction. For cases of depleted essence with no pain but itching in the genitals, use the Eight Ingredients Pill. If there is stomach weakness preventing the regulation of water pathways and qi deficiency affecting the bladder, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with added Astragalus and Scutellaria. For spleen deficiency due to blood loss and exhaustion from overwork leading to blood deficiency, use the Four Substance Decoction. When both qi and blood are deficient, use the Eight Substance Decoction. </p>
<p>For phlegm and fluids obstructing the qi pathways, use the Phlegm Resolving Decoction with added Scutellaria. If anger causes qi stagnation with blockage, use the Two Aged Decoction with added Saussurea and Cyperus, taking a cup first; then decoct the residue to induce vomiting to lift the qi, allowing water to descend naturally. In cases of real heat, use sugar with a small amount of bindweed to induce vomiting. </p>
<p>For upper heat conditions, use the Guide Red Powder with added Coptis and lotus seed. For lower deficiency, use the Kidney Nourishing Pill. For upper excess and lower deficiency, use the Clear Heart Lotus Seed Drink.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Frequent Urination</strong></p>
<p>The condition of frequent urination is due to heat in the bladder causing agitation. Use a combination of Four Ling Powder and San Huang Decoction, adding a small amount of Schisandra and Cornelian Cherry. If there&#39;s blood deficiency, use a combination of Four Ling Powder and Four Substance Decoction, adding Gardenia and Cimicifuga. </p>
<p>For deficiency of Kidney and Bladder energy, combine Shen Qi Decoction with Yi Zhi Ren, or use Suo Quan Pill, Da Tu Si Zi Pill, or Er Ling Pill. If symptoms worsen at night with increased Yin, or if there is internal deficiency with spontaneous sweating, use Mi Yuan Dan. For internal deficiency with damp heat, use Shen Qi Pill or Ba Wei Pill, reducing Ze Xie and Fu Zi, while adding Schisandra, Eucommia, and Rehmannia, and doubling the Cornelian Cherry. For deficiency with cold, use Gu Gui Decoction, and combine Da Tu Si Zi Pill with Cinnamon.</p>
<p>For those whose frequent urination is due to mental strain, use Miao Xiang San or Sang Qiao Xiao San. If the spleen is damaged by overwork, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>In cases of internal damage leading to frequent urination, the bladder cannot hold, resulting in involuntary urination or dribbling after urination, often due to excess fire and unrelenting water. Treatment should focus on nourishing the bladder’s Yin blood, clearing excess fire, while adding support from Cornelian Cherry, Oyster Shell, and Schisandra, avoiding warming herbs. The ancient formula for replenishing Yin Pills is most effective. For women, postpartum bladder injury, and for children with cold bladder, use Ji (Ming) Zhang Powder.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Essential Readings on Medicine</strong><br><strong>By Li Zhongzi (Ming Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Constipation</strong>  </p>
<p>Studying the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; one learns that constipation is primarily attributed to the lesser yin meridian. Although symptoms may vary, they generally stem from desiccated fluids. In detail, there are different types: fullness in the stomach, deficiency in the stomach, heat constipation, cold constipation, wind constipation, and qi constipation. </p>
<p>For fullness in the stomach leading to constipation, symptoms include good appetite, red urine, and treatment with formulations like Ma Ren Wan or Shi Xuan Wan. In cases of deficiency in the stomach, where appetite is poor and urine is clear, one can use Hou Po Tang. </p>
<p>Heat constipation presents with a flushed face, rapid pulse, bloating in the stomach and intestines, a desire for cold, or sores in the mouth, treated with Si Shun Qing Liang Yin, Run Chang Wan, or Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan. For fullness, use Cheng Qi Tang. </p>
<p>Cold constipation is marked by a pale or dark face, slow and deep pulse, clear urine, preference for warmth, and aversion to cold, treated with Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San, adding Gui Zhi and Zhi Ke, or swallowing Ban Liu Wan. </p>
<p>Qi constipation results from stagnation of qi, characterized by bloating and excessive belching, treated with Su Zi Jiang Qi Tang plus Zhi Ke, or swallowing Yang Zheng Dan; if ineffective, complement with Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan. </p>
<p>Wind constipation is due to wind affecting the lungs, transferring to the large intestine, addressed with Xiao Xue Ming Tang, reducing Fu Zi and increasing Shao Yao, and swallowing Run Chang Wan or Huo Xue Run Chang Wan.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Moreover, in the elderly, the body fluids may dry up; in women, there can be blood loss after childbirth; sweating and frequent urination may occur; and those who have recovered from illness may not fully regain their vitality, which can all lead to blockages. The method should be to nourish the qi and blood so that the body fluids can replenish and flow freely. Misusing harsh laxatives can often result in dire consequences, and the harm from substances like croton seed is even more rapid. The Eight Treasure Decoction should be augmented with perilla seed, tangerine peel, apricot kernels, and cynomorium, and the amount of angelica should be doubled. If the condition is associated with yin-cold, but the pulse is solid and slightly agitated, it is advisable to add a slight amount of warming herbs mixed with bitter cold to dispel heat and agitation, while preventing further increase in anxiety. If the yin is agitated and feels like sitting in a well, pressing down two inches will yield a sensation of vacuity, or the pulse may be thin and slow; in such cases, one should prepare the decoction and wait until it is extremely cold before consuming it. If the medicine does not produce the expected response and one does not dare to use drastic measures, one should consider using honey to prepare it. Adding five grams of salt and five grams of locust bean powder to the honey preparation will enhance its effectiveness. For cold blockages, ginger juice or fresh ginger may be used to guide it; or add a small quantity of aconite powder to the honey decoction. For heat conditions, pig bile should be used. In cases of prolonged deficiency, as a common dietary method, one should boil pig blood and organs and consume them with ghee. Blood continues to nourish blood, and organs continue to nourish organs; this is a marvelous method. I frequently observe that those in the countryside who casually use harsh laxatives suffer serious injuries in about 40% of cases, while those using croton seeds face severe harm in about 70-80% of cases; caution is imperative. Either over time the condition worsens into blockages, or it transforms into pulmonary tuberculosis with pus and blood, or results in the inability to eat and subsequent death.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Urinary Retention and Urinary Dysfunction</strong></p>
<p>Urinary retention and dysfunction are two conditions. In acute cases, it is called urinary retention, characterized by difficulty in urination. In chronic cases, it is referred to as urinary dysfunction, where there are frequent but scanty urinations. The conditions of retention and dysfunction are categorized in the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; into the liver and the governor vessel, the sanjiao and the bladder channels. However, the taiyang bladder primarily governs the storage of urine, while its expulsion is the responsibility of the liver channel, the governor vessel, and the sanjiao. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the bladder is considered the official for the distribution of fluids; when the fluids are transformed, they can be expelled. The channel responsible for transformation is the taiyin lung channel. If the lung is dry and cannot generate fluids, then the transformation cannot effectively reach the distribution organ. The treatment should focus on clearing the metal and nourishing the lungs, using herbs such as plantago, aster, ophiopogon, poria, and mulberry bark. </p>
<p>If the spleen is damp and fails to ascend essence, the lungs will be unable to generate fluids. In this case, the treatment should aim to dry the spleen and strengthen the stomach, using herbs like dahurian angelica, white atractylodes, poria, and pinellia. If kidney water is dry and heated, leading to ineffective bladder function, the approach should be to nourish the kidneys and clear heat, using herbs such as phellodendron, anemarrhena, poria, alisma, and tetrapanax. </p>
<p>Thus, nourishing the kidneys and draining the bladder is termed the appropriate treatment. Clearing the metal and moistening dryness is known as the second-tier treatment. Strengthening the stomach and drying the spleen is referred to as the third-tier treatment.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Additionally, if there is only moisture seeping into the large intestine, leading to dryness in the small intestine, one should use mild diuretics such as Poria, Polyporus, Rhemannia, and Alisma, mainly for drainage. If there is qi stagnation preventing the regulation of water pathways, resulting in water flowing down to the bladder, it is urgent to smooth the qi with herbs like Rhizoma, Akebia, and Tangerine Peel. In the case of actual heat, unless using purely Yin agents, Yang cannot be transformed. For heat in the upper jiao, use Gardenia and Scutellaria; for heat in the middle jiao, use Coptis and Peony; for heat in the lower jiao, use Berberine and Anemarrhena. If there is significant deficiency, without using warming and tonifying agents, water cannot flow, such as with Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. Dan Xi once said: “I use the technique of vomiting to help urination, comparable to a water droplet vessel; if the upper orifice is closed, the lower orifice cannot open, hence it is essential for the upper orifice to open in order for the water below to flow.” For qi deficiency, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, first ingesting then purging. For blood deficiency, use Xiong Gui Tang, also first ingesting before purging. For excessive phlegm, use Er Chen Tang, similarly first ingesting then purging. For qi obstruction, use Xiang Fu and Mu Tong to aid in purging. Moreover, if there is stagnant blood leading to urinary obstruction, use Achyranthes and Peach Kernel as primary herbs. The &quot;Prescription of Distinct Records&quot; states: “If urination is hindered, one must diagnose whether it is qi deficiency; Shen Qi Tang is effective.” From this, it can be observed that the origin of the illness does not come from a single pathway. If one does not follow the principles of observation, listening, inquiry, and palpation, attentively assessing and judging, and recklessly administers medications, how could it not be a game with human lives?<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Incontinence</strong></p>
<p>In the ordinary management of incontinence, people only know to supplement the deficiency. They do not understand that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; discusses the diseases of the liver, kidneys, and bladder without pointing to the specific evil that afflicts them. It is known that the seven emotions and six influences can all cause illness. It is also said that when the hand Taiyin is deficient, it relates to the mother-child connection in disease, indicating that the five evils, whether produced, counteracted, or uncounteracted, can all lead to illness. </p>
<p>To summarize the key points: the lungs govern Qi, which facilitates the generation of fluids, distributing them to the bladder where bodily fluids are stored, and through transformation can be released. If the water source does not stop, the bladder does not retain. These two channels are fundamentally responsible for regulation. A deficiency in the lungs indicates an upper deficiency; thus, one should tonify Qi with a formula like Ren Shen Bai Du San. If not improved, Huang Lian, Sheng Di, and Mai Men Dong should be used to clear the heat. </p>
<p>A deficiency in the bladder indicates a lower deficiency; therefore, one should use supplements like Sang Piao Xiao or similar types. In cases accompanied by cold, use Jia Jiu Zi Wan, Gu Pao Wan, Bai Fu Ling San, or Tu Si Zi San. For slippery and variable presentations, use Mu Li Wan. If there is accompanying heat, Bai Wei San or Ji Chang San can be utilized. </p>
<p>There are also cases of nocturnal enuresis that are attributed to deficiency, where infants may have fragile bladder Qi and the elderly may have insufficient lower origin, leading to numerous such conditions. In infants, those with heat account for about 70-80%; in the elderly, those with cold also account for about the same percentage. This differentiation cannot be overlooked. </p>
<p>It is advisable to prepare a large dose of Tu Si Zi Wan, crush roasted pig bladder, and decoct it to take. Additionally, one must carefully assess the presence of cold or heat to determine the appropriate treatment method.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Injury from Cold: Difficulty in Urination</strong></p>
<p>After sweating and purging, if urination is difficult, and there is heart discomfort, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. After sweating in the Taiyang stage, if the pulse is floating, urination is difficult, there is slight heat and thirst, use Wu Ling San. If there is yellowing of the body, difficulty in urination, and slight abdominal fullness, use Yin Chen Hao Tang. If urination is difficult, with alternating constipation and diarrhea, slight heat, and dry stools, use Cheng Qi Decoction. If there is tidal fever, diarrhea, and difficulty in urination, use Chai Ling Tang. In cases of wind-dampness with spontaneous sweating, a heavy body, and difficulty in urination, use Gan Cao Fu Zi Tang. If there is heat blocking the flow, pound field snails (or stone calcium carbonate) and add a small amount of musk, applying it to the navel. If there is cold blocking the flow, use roasted salt to heat and apply to the area below the navel.</p>
<p><strong>Injury from Cold: Frequent Urination</strong></p>
<p>Frequent urination means the urination is short in quantity and occurs frequently. After sweating and vomiting in the Taiyang stage, if urination is frequent, with delirium, use Tiao Wei Cheng Qi Decoction. If there is spontaneous sweating in the Taiyang stage, along with stiffness in the limbs, heart discomfort, slight aversion to cold, and frequent urination, use Gan Cao Gan Jiang Tang or Shao Yao Gan Cao Tang.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>Xue Ji&#39;s Medical Case Study - Ming Dynasty</p>
<p>Diagnosis and Treatment of Urination Disorders</p>
<p>The classics state: When the bladder is not firmly controlled, it leads to incontinence; urination occurs frequently and without awareness. The process of urination relies on the transmission of energy from both the heart and kidneys. Essentially, the heart is paired with the small intestine, while the kidneys are paired with the bladder. If the energies of the heart and kidneys are depleted, the transmission becomes obstructed, resulting in this condition. </p>
<p>The treatment should focus on warming the lower yang, clearing the heart, and minimizing desires. Additionally, complications from childbirth may injure the bladder. For those with internal cold deficiency, prescriptions like Xiyuan Dan or Jiuzi Wan should be considered. For those with internal damp-heat deficiency, Liuw Wei Di Huang Wan, possibly supplemented with Wuwei, Du Zhong, or Bu Guo Zhi, is recommended. The elderly may use a formula involving Ba Wei Wan. For those with issues arising from improper childbirth or loss of support to the bladder, a medicinal concoction like Shen Zhu Bu Bao Tang should be prepared, akin to the recipe for pig or sheep bladders.</p>
<p>I opine that the liver governs urination; if there is blood deficiency in the liver, one should use formulas like Si Wu and Shan Zhi. Should there be urination difficulties or pain in the urethra, likely due to liver damp-heat, Long Dan Xie Gan Tang is indicated. If urination is frequent and worsens with effort, it is attributed to spleen Qi deficiency; in this case, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with added Shan Yao and Wuwei is beneficial. </p>
<p>If there is a lack of control over urination or persistent dripping, it may indicate a deficiency in Yin, for which Liuw Wei Di Huang Wan would be appropriate. If urinary flow is obstructed and supplementation exacerbates the condition, this points to heat accumulation in the bladder, which can be treated with Wu Lin San. If the spleen and lungs are too dry to sustain the body, Huang Qin Qing Fei Yin can help. For bladder Yin deficiency and lack of yang generation, Zi Shen Wan should be used. For bladder Yang deficiency and lack of transformation of Yin, Liuw Wei Wan is indicated.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>If one experiences impotence and desire but cannot produce semen, with pain in the penis like strangulation, one should add Chuanqian and Niuxi to the basic formula of the Eight Ingredients pill. If an elderly person suffers from exhaustion and has painful urination resembling strangulation, the same prescription should be applied; if it does not respond, urgently add Fuzi, as many can still recover.</p>
<p>If the liver fire cannot be restrained and there is involuntary urination or painful urination, and if one takes drying agents that result in frequent or painful urination, use the Four Substances formula, along with wheat and the Five Flavors herb and licorice. If the urination is frequent and yellow, add Shan Zhuyu, Huangbai, Zhimu to the Four Substances formula, along with the Five Flavors and wheat.</p>
<p>If there is deficiency of the spleen and insufficient production, use the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi formula with Shan Yao and wheat. If there is weakness and frequent urination, use the Dihuang pill. If there is heat obstructing the bladder leading to painful urination, apply the Wuling powder. If the spleen and lungs are dry and unable to nourish, use the Huangqin Qingfei drink to clear the lungs.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>If the bladder is deficient in yin, resulting in an inability to generate yang and causing dripping urination, use the Kidney Nourishing Pills. If the bladder is deficient in yang, resulting in an inability to transform and causing turbid urination, use the Six-Flavor Pill. If there is cramping and difficulty with urination, or urgent dyspnea as if about to die, regardless of gender or pregnancy, urgently use the Eight-Flavor Pill; delaying will mean no relief. If an elderly man experiences impotence and desires sexual activity, yet is unable to ejaculate and suffers from internal decline, with painful and turbid urination, incorporate additional herbs in the modified Eight-Flavor Pill, such as Plantago and Achyranthes. If an elderly person has completely depleted their essence and is continuously consuming it, experiencing pulling pain in both urination and defecation—where the pain worsens with the urge to pass and the urge to pass worsens the pain—also treat with the previous medicine; if ineffective, promptly add Aconite. If there is wheezing, cough with phlegm, cold swelling in the legs and feet, severe pain in the waist and bones, and facial swelling, along with pain in the sun region, also use the previous medicine. If the pain improves but urination remains turbid, it is advisable to use the modified Eight-Flavor Pill for gentle treatment.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br><strong>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 265</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Gates of Urination and Defecation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Canon by Zhao Xianke (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Constipation</strong></p>
<p>If the kidneys are deficient and there is a sensation of heaviness in the lower body, one may feel the urge to defecate multiple times without being able to do so, often accompanied by painful sensations in the urethra. There may be instances where one is able to urinate but struggles with defecation, feeling pain instead. The treatise by Zhu’s &quot;Theory of Essence and Blood&quot; states that when essence is depleted and further exhausted, it can lead to pain in the pathways of urination and defecation; the more painful it is, the more the urge to defecate increases, and the more one attempts to defecate, the more pain ensues. It is necessary to administer a modified “Bou Zhong Yi Qi Decoction” with a doubled dose of Sheng Ma along with “Si Shen Wan”. Additionally, using “Ba Wei Di Huang Wan” while adding Wu Wei Zi, Wu Zhu Yu, Bu Gu Zhi, and Rou Dou Kou, with frequent consumption, will also yield effects. Such symptoms arise from laxatives damaging the vital energy, resulting in bodily swelling and lethargy, which is beyond count. Since the kidneys govern urination and defecation, failure in these functions is attributed to kidney issues. Therefore, can it be denied that constipation is not linked to the kidneys? The “True Words of the Golden Coffer” states: The black color of the northern direction pertains to the kidneys, opening the orifices of the two lower yin.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>Therefore, when kidney qi is deficient, urination becomes difficult. It is advisable to supplement yin and promote the water pathways with herbs such as Rehmannia, Cistanche, Plantago seeds, and Poria. Additionally, one should use some warming herbs to open up the pores, facilitate the production of bodily fluids, and moisten dryness. The ancients stated: the secrets of the organs cannot be treated uniformly; there are heat disorders, cold disorders, excess disorders, deficiency disorders, wind disorders, and qi disorders. Elderly individuals, postpartum women, and those who have sweated excessively causing frequent urination, or those unwell whose qi and blood have not yet recovered can all develop restraint, and should avoid medicines such as sodium nitrate, yellow sulfur, bovine beans, and morning glory seeds. People commonly recognize heat disorders but are ignorant of cold disorders. Cold disorders arise when cold energy obstructs the intestines and stomach, congealing yin and causing bodily fluids to stagnate, resulting in blocked stomach qi. Such individuals experience excessive internal gas and prefer warmth over cold. It is recommended to brew a large dose of Ba Wei Di Huang Wan; cold beverages will help. Alternatively, one can use the prescribed Half Sulfur Pills, crushed with fresh ginger and mixed with frankincense for ingestion; or the cold-reducing Hai Zang Pills, all of which are effective. Hai Zang also notes: although the cold-reducing pills are hot, they are guided downward by the moisture of peony and fennel, allowing the yin to receive the yang and thus facilitating urination. When the warmth of spring is encountered, the ice will naturally melt.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>However, it is even more wonderful than the Eight-Flavored Pill. Dongyuan states: the kidneys govern the five fluids; when the fluids are abundant, the bowel movements are normal. If one experiences hunger, satiety, or excessive labor, it can damage the stomach&#39;s energy. Additionally, consuming spicy, hot, and rich flavors may cause fire evils to lurk in the blood, depleting the true yin and leading to deficiency of fluids, resulting in dry constipation of the large intestine. Furthermore, in the elderly with qi deficiency, when fluids are diminished, there can also be constipation. The kidneys dislike dryness and urgently require spicy substances to moisten them. I have followed Dongyuan&#39;s theories without using Dongyuan&#39;s prescriptions, avoiding pills and decoctions like the Moistening Intestines Pill, Moistening Dryness Decoction, and Unblocking the Ghost Dispersion. Instead, I utilized the Six-Flavored Rehmannia Pill, brewed and taken, which led to healing. In cases of heat-induced constipation combined with qi deficiency, adding five qian each of ginseng and astragalus to the previous decoction results in immediate recovery. This is because the qi deficiency cannot promote movement, and the yin deficiency cannot moisten. The above treatment methods have been personally tested and proven effective, avoiding the use of substances that break qi and blood, such as rhubarb, peach kernel, and bitter orange, allowing for long-term use without causing constipation. Therefore, I present this information.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Someone asked: Why not use the Four Substance Decoction? The answer: The Four Substance Decoction is especially effective for replenishing blood. However, if there is insufficient Tianjin fluid, it becomes difficult to use. The classics state: the large intestine governs fluids, the small intestine governs liquids. Furthermore, it is said: the kidneys control the five liquids. All fluids are transformed from the kidney water; how are they related to blood? Hence, the Four Substance Decoction is not used. </p>
<p>Another asked: In cases of severe dryness and constipation, can salts or sulfur be temporarily used? The answer: The Chengqi Decoction uses salts and sulfur specifically for instances where a cold has moved from the exterior to the interior, transforming into heat, and this heat enters the three yin, fearing that the kidneys may become dehydrated; therefore salts and sulfur are used to expel the external pathogen and quickly restore kidney water. </p>
<p>I alone prohibit their use for the elderly, those who are deficient, and those recovering from illness, as the kidney water is originally insufficient to lead to dehydration. If one were to further use salts and sulfur and similar medicines, it would multiply their deficiency; although it may provide immediate relief, it will ultimately worsen the condition. After repeated use, even iron stones may not bring about a resolution. If anyone suffers from this, they should be comforted and not allowed to act hastily, putting themselves in danger. Moreover, for the elderly, having a firm exit is a sign of longevity, which is common. If one takes the Six-Flavors or Eight-Flavors regularly, they can maintain peace without concerns.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>Urinary Obstruction Should Not Be Taken Lightly</p>
<p>When urination is obstructed, it is not a trivial matter. If there is urgent pain in the lower abdomen, resembling an overturned bowl, with an overwhelming urge that cannot be suppressed, and if one has not urinated by morning, it can lead to vomiting, a condition known as &quot;Guan Ge.&quot; If the condition persists, it may even lead to death. Nowadays, when people encounter this syndrome, they resort only to Wu Ling San and end up helpless. If one applies salt to the lower abdomen or uses methods involving mole crickets or snails on the navel, that is merely a superficial remedy. If bodily fluids are excessively absorbed in the intestines and stomach, causing diarrhea while urination is obstructed, then Wu Ling San should be used to promote urination. If water is stagnant below the heart and cannot reach the bladder, Wu Ling San should also be employed to induce drainage. If the six bowels are overheated and this heat transfers to the lower jiao causing obstruction, then Yi Yuan San should be used to clear it. If energy is pressing and causing blockage, preventing normal rising and falling, one should use Sheng Ma to lift it or induce vomiting. This is similar to how water flows: if the upper orifices are open, the lower orifices will also be unobstructed.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>The classics say: The bladder is the official of the capital region, where fluids are stored, and when the qi transforms, it can discharge. Furthermore, it says: The Sanjiao is the official of the waterways, from which fluids emerge. It is clear that the bladder can only store water; it must rely on the transformation of qi in the Sanjiao to be able to discharge water. There are cases where one has taken excessive hot herbs like prepared aconite, which depletes lung yin, causing qi not to transform; using Huanglian to detoxify and open up works in this case. There are also instances of using Poria, Chenpi, and licorice decoction to deliver powdered musk and agarwood, which also demonstrates the transformation of qi. The treatment methods above are all based on excess conditions, indicating that there is already water in the bladder; whether due to heat accumulation or qi obstruction, there is water that can be opened and discharged. In contrast, the condition of inability to discharge is associated with deficiency and excessive sweating, leading to dryness within the five organs, where fatty resources are already depleted, unable to generate fluids. In such cases, there is originally no water accumulation in the bladder, and trying to open it is akin to begging for food from someone impoverished; one who is in want will only become more destitute.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>Therefore, the East Garden divides treatment based on qi in the blood, distinguishing it by thirst or lack thereof. If there is thirst but difficulty in urination, this belongs to the upper jiao&#39;s qi division. Water arises from metal; if the lungs are hot, then the source of purification is cut off. One should assist the lungs during autumn, allowing water to arise naturally. When autumn arrives and white dew falls, one must use clear metal medicines, such as Sheng Mai San. Additionally, in cases of lung deficiency, this is typically due to irregular diet that damages stomach qi and leads to a deficiency in the lower jiao. As the scriptures say, if the spleen and stomach are both deficient, the nine orifices will be obstructed. One can use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to replenish, using warm herbs like ginseng and astragalus to first regulate the stomach qi, allowing the rising and circulating energies to elevate the clear and lower the turbid. Clearing the lungs is treatment that is two steps removed; replenishing the spleen is treatment that is three steps removed. Thus, the essence of the East Garden&#39;s replenishment for deficiency resembles this.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>This discusses the sources of transformation in the post-natal. If one is not thirsty but experiences difficulty in urination, this pertains to the lower body and blood. The lower body consists of the kidneys and the bladder; it is the deepest part of Yin. When Yin is heated and obstructed, it blocks its outflow. The scripture says: without Yang, Yin cannot generate; without Yin, Yang cannot transform. If one uses a medicine that is slightly penetrating, it is Yin within Yang, not a purely Yin remedy; how can Yang transform? It is necessary to use the Nourishing Kidney Pill, which has both essence and flavor of Yin, the deepest aspect of Yin. </p>
<p>Dr. Dongyuan treated a patient whose eyes were bulging, abdomen distended like a drum, hardness above the knees, skin on the verge of cracking, unable to eat, and suffering from constipation in a life-threatening state. After contemplating through half the night, he found a remedy that cured him immediately. This illustrates the situation where Yin deficiency prevents Yang from transforming. However, Dr. Dongyuan has not discussed cases of true Yang and true Yin deficiency. If there is true Yin deficiency, the Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill is to be used to replenish Kidney Water. The Nourishing Kidney Pill should be avoided, as Huangbo and Zhimu might overpower with their bitter coldness and drain Water.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>Avoid using medicines with mild flavors that cause leakage. For those with true Yang deficiency, one must take the Eight Flavor Pill. Zhu states: When Yin has withered and one seeks to reduce the essence, the essence does not flow out and deteriorates internally. The urinary passage becomes thick like a drip; when the essence is depleted and further exhausted, there is pain along the urinary and defecation paths. The more pain, the more frequent the urge to urinate; the more one urinates, the more pain occurs. Dai remarks: There are cases that resemble dysuria but are not, where the urine has a consistency like mucus; this indicates that both essence and urine are being expelled, blocking the urinary passage, causing pain and inability to expel. It&#39;s advisable to use Great Cuscuta Seed Pill or Deer Antler Pill. Dai also adopted Zhu&#39;s method. If it leads to cramping, shortness of breath, and a desire to die—regardless of gender or postpartum status—immediate use of the Eight Flavor Pill decocted as a drink is essential; delay means no remedy.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>Some may doubt the effectiveness of桂 (osmanthus) attached to the hot property of 辛 (辛 spice), not daring to use it carelessly. How could they know the meaning of kidney essence being deficient and the coldness of water freezing? When heat is received, it circulates; aside from this, what else could directly reach the bladder and allow the snow to melt and spring water to flow? </p>
<p>Dan Xi treated an elderly man suffering from difficult urination, who had taken too many diuretics, resulting in a blockage with only drops coming out. I used a tonic, 补中益气汤 (Buzhong Yiqi Decoction), which, after one dose, corrected the flow. Because he had initially overused diuretics, it damaged his kidney qi, leading to subsequent bedwetting that persisted all night. I urgently replenished his kidney essence, and then it was resolved. </p>
<p>In all medical treatments, no practitioner lacks the use of draining diuretics; who can solidify the deficiency of kidney qi? I particularly highlight this as a warning for the world. If there are those who follow Dan Xi’s methods, they must already understand the deficiency of lung qi. How could they not match the benefits of kidney essence with the tonic given? The &#39;Lingshu&#39; states that the hand Taiyin is also known as 列缺 (Lieque), with symptoms of deficiency leading to shortness of breath and frequent urination.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>The lungs belong to the upper jiao, regulating the pathways of water, and descending to the bladder. The kidneys are also connected to the lungs, making the two organs a mother and child relationship. When the mother is deficient, the child is also deficient; this is the principle of nature. Dongyuan states: if there is a loss of urination, it is due to a deficiency of lung metal. It is advisable to rest and nurture the qi, avoiding labor, and to take tonics such as astragalus and ginseng; if there is no improvement, one must then consider the kidneys. The classics say: if the bladder is not controlled, it leads to involuntary urination. Zhongjing notes: when the lower jiao is exhausted, there will be loss of urination and bowel control. Additionally, if the lower jiao does not return, there will be involuntary urination. The lower jiao is at the opening of the bladder, responsible for distinguishing clear and turbid urine and stool; if it does not return to its area, it cannot control urination, resulting in involuntary urination. Generally, in warm weather, wearing thicker clothes leads to more sweating, whereas in cold weather, wearing lighter clothes leads to more urination. Increased urination is due to cold. For those who cannot control it, and if there is severe deficiency and cold, only the Eight-Flavored Pill will be effective. Ancient formulas such as the Cuscuta Seed Pill, Deer Antler Pill, and the Two-Qi Elixir can all be selected for use.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>Dai said: &quot;For those who wet the bed while sleeping, this is also due to cold in the lower origin. With no restrictions on urination, it is advisable to use Great Dodder Seed Pill and to brew the crushed pig bladder in soup. All cases of bedwetting are attributed to deficiency. Liu Hejian states that excessive heat affects the kidney area and obstructs the liver&#39;s pathways, leading to severe stagnation where Qi and blood cannot flow, resulting in weakness and lack of response. Therefore, fluids leak into the bladder, causing involuntary urination and inability to control it. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the loss of urination due to excessive yin energy is a heat condition that should not be overlooked. Examining the &quot;Xue An,&quot; it is noted that fatigue can cause heat leading to thirst and spontaneous urination, sometimes with persistence. This may also stem from liver fire and blood deficiency, with the yin failing to constrain. In the morning, supplement with the Middle-Qi Benefiting Decoction adding yam and cornel; in the afternoon, take Six Flavors Pill, and after a month, the condition should improve. Generally, in cases of unconstrained conditions, there is more deficiency fire and less real heat. If one mistakenly uses purging methods for deficiency conditions, it can quickly become critical, so caution is advised.&quot;<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Urinary Retention</strong></p>
<p>If small water does not flow, it is called urinary retention, which is the most dangerous and urgent symptom. When the water pathway is obstructed, it invades and causes bloating in the spleen and stomach, leads to swelling in the muscles, results in vomiting when it affects the central region, and causes wheezing if it attacks the upper region. If it remains obstructed for several days, it can lead to urgent distress and must result in a critical condition. Nowadays, people encounter this symptom and only know to promote urination, or use methods like sealing the navel with a snail, without distinguishing the underlying causes, which explains why many remain untreated.</p>
<p>In general, the causes of urinary retention fall into four categories, and it is essential to differentiate between deficiency and excess. If an obstruction in the small intestine and bladder is caused by fire pathogens, it is because the water source has dried up, and the gas orifices are hot and blocked. If heat settles in the liver and kidneys, it may lead to either depletion of essence or blood stagnation, blocking the water pathways. In such cases, there is in fact water present, but it is just obstructed; the excess can be cleared or promoted, and treatment options can be employed to facilitate this, which are lighter forms of urinary retention.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to qi obstruction, the condition is particularly critical. There are two meanings to qi obstruction: one is due to excessive qi leading to blockage, and the other is due to deficient qi causing the blockage.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>The bladder serves as the organ that stores water, and the entry of water is transformed by qi; thus, where there is qi, there is water. The expulsion of water relies on water reaching qi; hence, when there is water, there is urination. The classics state: &quot;Qi transformation allows for expulsion.&quot; This implies that there must be transformation for entry before there can be transformation for exit; without transformation for entry, there can be no transformation for exit. Therefore, both entry and exit are dependent on qi transformation. This is the essence of qi transformation as stated in the classics, not merely discussing qi transformation in relation to exit alone. </p>
<p>Thus, within water there is qi, and qi is water; within qi there is water, and water is qi. Now, whenever there is a disease characterized by deficient qi and obstruction, it is invariably due to the depletion of true yang, the root of the primordial sea is absent, water and fire do not interact, and yin and yang are separated. As a result, qi fails to transform into water, and water remains stagnant. When qi does not transform water, then the water organ becomes exhausted; when water is stagnant, it can lead to seepage and decay. If qi cannot transform but attempts to forcibly promote flow, will that truly work? In instances where there is no yang in yin, and one uses harsh cold medicines, what can that achieve? The principle is quite clear. </p>
<p>As for qi being full yet obstructed, it is simply due to a strong liver causing qi to rebel, which obstructs the bladder, either breaking the qi or relieving the stagnation, or raising what has fallen – thus, any obstructions will naturally resolve. Treatment for fullness is not difficult, but treatment for emptiness must achieve transformation, which is not easy. Therefore, whenever faced with this pattern, one must not overlook a detailed differentiation between fullness and emptiness.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>When there is fire in the lower burner and the bladder is hot, closed, and obstructed, there will certainly be indications of fire and hot channels, along with symptoms such as pain in the urinary tract. It is advisable to use remedies like Da Fen Qing Yin, Chou Xin Yin, Yi Yuan San, Yu Quan San, and Lu Dou Yin to facilitate drainage. If the real fire of the liver and kidneys is not cleared, or if there is turbidity or blood seen, generally clearing away the fire will ensure that the water flows freely; all previous methods can be applied. </p>
<p>In cases of Qi stagnation, treatment should distinguish between deficiency and excess, cold and heat. For instances of Qi excess, Qi is blocked between the small intestine and bladder, leading to obstruction, often due to the liver&#39;s strong Qi rebelling. Those who are prone to sudden anger and emotional restraint often exhibit this. It is advisable to focus on breaking Qi and promoting blood flow with herbs such as Xiang Fu, Zhi Ke, Wu Yao, Chen Xiang, and Hui Xiang, in conjunction with Si Ling San. If Qi is trapped below and the medicinal properties cannot immediately reach it, one should take these remedies in abundance and induce vomiting to raise the Qi, allowing the fluid to descend. </p>
<p>For phlegm and Qi stagnation which is obstructed and not flowing, use formulations like Er Chen Tang and Liu An Jian to induce vomiting. For heat obstructing and Qi rebelling, apply Da Fen Qing Yin to induce vomiting.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>If there is excess Qi and deficiency of blood leading to obstruction, use the Siwu Decoction to induce vomiting. In cases of excess Qi and similar symptoms, nothing is more effective than inducing vomiting. It is like a container for dripping water; if the upper opening is closed, the lower opening cannot function. If the upper opening is opened, the lower opening will surely flow freely. This is the natural principle of rise and fall. </p>
<p>In cases where there is deficiency of Qi and difficulty urinating, it must be due to excessive loss of the foundational essence, or from aging and depletion of energy, leading to this condition. This is primarily because Qi is not being transformed, which is a critical situation. However, those suffering from this condition will experience gradual changes, noticing only a slight decrease in urination or difficulty during urination, so timely attention and treatment are essential. Waiting until it becomes severe may result in missed opportunities for intervention. </p>
<p>When treating this condition, it is also important to distinguish between the cold and heat of the organ&#39;s Qi. If there is no internal heat present, it is undoubtedly a case of Yang deficiency. If the illness has not yet become serious, one should use formulas such as Zuogui, Yougui, Liuwai, or Bamei, or bolster water to clear the heat or enhance fire to transform the Qi, applying them as appropriate to gradually eliminate the root cause. </p>
<p>If the illness has already become severe, one should definitely use the Bamei Pills or a modified large dose of Jin Kui Shen Qi Decoction, prepared and consumed, in order to possibly restore health.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>Some may doubt the use of cassia for its warm properties, fearing to use it lightly. How could they know that the yang energy of the lower source is greatly depleted? When exposed to cold, it condenses; when exposed to heat, it flows. Apart from these two elements, what else can directly reach the bladder and allow water to transform due to qi? If qi is deficient and descending improperly, one should use a tonic like &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; to address it, or this decoction might also be the best choice to induce vomiting. If one has a constitution with weak yang organs, internal heat unbearable to warming tonics, leading to urinary obstruction, it surely indicates a depletion of true yin; without yin, there can be no transformation of yang, resulting in water deficiency symptoms. Treatment should focus on nourishing yin and suppressing yang, primarily using medicinals like &quot;Huaye Decoction.&quot; If there is excessive yang but water cannot control fire, &quot;Zishen Pill&quot; from Dongyuan may also be appropriate, but it belongs to the category of fire symptoms. When both urination and defecation are obstructed, one must first clear the bowels, and then urination will resolve on its own. &quot;Bazhengesan&quot; and similar formulas should guide the treatment. </p>
<p>Long-term consumption of cassia or similar herbs can lead to water depletion and excessive yang, causing urinary retention; thus, a detoxifying and water-nourishing approach is necessary, using methods like &quot;Huaye Decoction.&quot; In severe cases, &quot;Huanglian Jiedu Decoction&quot; with added herbs for tonifying yin may be feasible. The &quot;Ludou Drink&quot; is a miraculous remedy for detoxification. If someone has long used yang tonics excessively, leading to a situation where fire is not inherently strong but merely due to water depletion, a large dose of &quot;Liu Wei Di Huang Decoction&quot; is essential to nourish the body. If after taking many diuretics urination still does not improve, this surely indicates a depletion condition.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>To address the deficiency of water, one must greatly nourish the true yin; if there is a deficiency of fire, one must vigorously replenish yang energy. When the qi reaches the water element, it will naturally adjust itself. One should not simply focus on superficial imbalances and recklessly remove blockages, as this is akin to squeezing out juice and draining oil. It will only lead to further depletion, which is dangerous.</p>
<p>In cases where there is no water in the bladder, symptoms can arise from diarrhea causing water to return to the large intestine, resulting in difficulty with urination. This should be treated by addressing the diarrhea; when the diarrhea stops, the water will flow naturally. If a person experiences profuse sweating, resulting in difficulty with urination due to qi being lost through sweat, the treatment should involve regulating the nutritive and defensive qi, allowing urination to improve naturally.</p>
<p>In cases of deficiency due to excessive labor and blood loss, where water is lost and the internal organs become dried out, leading to difficulty with urination, one must tonify the true yin. As blood and qi gradually replenish, urination will improve.</p>
<p>All of these scenarios reflect the condition of a dehydrated bladder and should not involve further reduction of fluids. Only in the case of diarrhea is there a potential for reducing fluids, and that is typically limited to a third of the time. These conditions do not indicate a blockage due to water not flowing; treatment should be sought from their respective paths.</p>
<p>For pregnant women, if there is a difficulty with urination, it is often due to the pressure of the fetus pushing down, which compresses the urethra, typically because of qi deficiency that cannot lift the fetus. In such cases, one should use formulations like Ba Zhen Tang or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang.</p>
<p>If at the time of delivery the fetus is pressing on the bladder causing difficulty with urination, one should use a finger to lift the fetus, which will allow urination to occur.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Incontinence due to Loss</h3>
<p>Inanimate loss can happen in various ways: some individuals may experience it due to self-inflicted causes while sleeping; others may be unable to prevent it due to weakness in the qi gate, leading to frequent occurrences; and there are those who may experience qi escaping upwards, resulting in a lack of control over the lower part of the body, where loss occurs unnoticed—this is a sign of extreme deficiency. </p>
<p>In summary, all three cases are associated with deficiency, but there is a distinction between severity. If someone loses control in their dreams, it is mostly found in the young, and as their qi strengthens and consolidates, or with some appropriate adjustments, they can recover without doubt. However, if one cannot hold urine due to a continuous flow of water and weakened bladder, it is certainly due to deficiency of qi. Qi is the root of water; without sufficient qi, water cannot be retained, and only with qi can one hold it. This indicates a major issue of losing control, which is greatly undesirable. Particularly concerning is when qi escapes, leading to incontinence without awareness—it is much more critical. </p>
<p>This is usually not related to wind conditions or individuals in old age with weakened qi, or often following severe illness. As Zhang Zhongjing stated: when the lower jiao is depleted, it leads to incontinence. This is what he meant. </p>
<p>In ancient texts discussing urinary incontinence, there is a distinction between hot and weak conditions. It is misunderstood that incontinence is due to excessive urination, often indicating deficiency and coldness, not heat. When heat causes frequent urination, the symptoms may include profuse dribbling and inability to hold it, with possibly painful urination—these indicate heat conditions, which must be treated differently, not as loss of control. Should one mistakenly identify deficiency and cold as heat and recklessly administer purging medications, it would lead to severe consequences. </p>
<h3>Discussion on Treatment<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></h3>
<p>In addressing the issue of frequent urination, traditional methods often rely on solidifying remedies, which is indeed appropriate. However, these remedies merely secure the openings and represent a symptomatic treatment rather than addressing the root cause. Although urination is linked to the kidneys, the kidneys are associated with the lungs; if lung qi is inadequate, the kidney water cannot be contained. Therefore, to manage water, one must also manage qi; to treat the kidneys, one must address the lungs. </p>
<p>It is advisable to primarily use ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, cinnamon, prepared aconite, and dried ginger, and then appropriately add solidifying remedies. This approach may address the underlying cause and ensure continuous flow. Otherwise, it is merely a temporary fix without lasting benefit. I have formulated the Gongdi Pill for treatment, suitable for heart, spleen, lung, and kidney conditions, and it should be used as a primary remedy.</p>
<p>In cases of spleen and lung qi deficiency, where the water pathways cannot be restricted, resulting in frequent urination, the issue lies within the upper and middle jiao. It is advisable to use formulas like Zhongy益气 Decoction, Lizhong Decoction, Wengwei Drink, Gui Spleen Decoction, or similar, adding solidifying remedies as the main treatment; if there is no improvement, one should then focus on the kidneys.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>If the yang energy of the liver and kidneys is deficient, then the bladder cannot hold, and the flow of water will not cease. The root cause of this resides in the mingmen (life gate). One should take Right Returning Decoction, Great Supplementing Yuan Decoction, or Six-Flavor Returning Yang Decoction; in severe cases, remedies like Siwei Powder may be used, or adding Guo Ke as an assistant is also acceptable. One can also use Jiyao Si Shen Pill or Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Pill without Ze Xie.</p>
<p>For those who experience incontinence during sleep, it must be due to deficiency and coldness in the lower source, leading to a lack of stability. One should use Da Tu Si Zi Pill, Family Garlic Seed Pill, Wu Zi Pill, or Suo Quan Pill. If a child has been unrestrained since childhood, resulting in habitual incontinence, this is a matter of habitual behavior and lack of awareness, which is a mental issue. One should focus on treating the spirit, as medication cannot remedy it. If lax behavior leads to instability, it should be treated as previously described. It is advisable to use roasted pig or sheep urine as a decoction with the preceding medications for better effect.</p>
<p>If incontinence occurs due to fear or anxiety, it indicates insufficient heart qi, leading to the connection between the heart, liver, and kidneys. Remedies such as Great Supplementing Yuan Decoction, Gui Pi Decoction, or Five Gentlemen Decoction should be utilized. Ancient formulas to strengthen the yang and stabilize the lower region, such as Fennel and Wisdom Pill, Erqi Dan, Guo Pao Wan, Miyuan Dan, Oyster Pill, Jisheng Tu Si Zi Pill, and Gu Zhen San, may all be selected and used as appropriate.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>Secret Instructions of the Stone Chamber</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Dry Constipation</strong> </p>
<p>When dryness becomes severe and fire is intense, the yin of the large intestine is depleted, leading to feces resembling sheep droppings, known as intestinal obstruction, an untreatable condition. However, if the yin is depleted, death should follow. Currently, not dead but suffering from intestinal obstruction indicates that the yin is not yet completely exhausted. As long as true yin remains, one cannot die, and as long as there is a thread of life, there is potential for recovery. I have a unique formula that specifically nourishes the yin, allowing the yin to regenerate and the fire to subside; when the yin is abundant, the intestines will be relaxed. The formula to use is the “Yin Nourishing Opening Obstruction Decoction”: 2 liang of cooked rehmannia, 1 liang each of ophiopogon and angelica, 5 qian each of raw rehmannia, achyranthes, lily bulb, cornelian cherry, and processing with mild liquor, and 3 qian of Chinese yam, all decocted in water for consumption. After taking several doses, the intestinal obstruction can be relieved, and feces will no longer resemble sheep droppings, allowing hope for regeneration. However, it is essential to take one dose daily for three months, then switch to the “Six Flavor Rehmannia Decoction,” or instead of a decoction, use pills to adjust for over a year, thereby ensuring that there will be no more suffering from colon problems.</p>
<p>As for those considering the cause of constipation to be excessive dryness of the large intestine, who knows it could be dryness of the lung qi? If the lungs are dry, the clearing and descending qi cannot flow down into the large intestine, and the water from the kidney channel is only enough to take care of itself; how could it flow out to moisten the streams? The formula to use consists of 3 liang each of cooked rehmannia and ophiopogon, 1 qian of hemp seed, and 2 qian of siler; boil with 1 bowl of cow&#39;s milk and 2 zhongs of water until reduced to six parts, then combine with the cow&#39;s milk and take 1 bowl. If one dose does not resolve the issue, the second dose will surely lead to a bowel movement.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>The essence of this formula lies in nourishing the kidney without moistening the large intestine; even more remarkably, it not only nourishes the kidney but also the lung; and even more so, it not only nourishes the lung but also raises the lung. The large intestine is located in the lower part of the body and is most difficult to treat on its own; it must be moistened from the kidney channel and cleared from the lung channel. When the qi flows downwards and settles at the bottom, without using methods to elevate and raise, water will become blocked and stagnant. By opening the upper orifice, the lower orifice will naturally flow; this is a method of treating lower ailments by addressing upper issues, and it is also a method of treating organ ailments through channel organs. The remaining methods for treating organ ailments can be understood from this.</p>
<p>After a long illness, or if there is no bowel movement for a month, there is no need for haste; simply nourish the true yin, allowing the essence to be sufficient to generate blood, and the blood to be sufficient to moisten the intestines, thereby allowing bowel movements to occur naturally. The formula consists of 1 ounce each of cooked rehmannia, gardenia, and angelica, 5 qian of chuanxiong, 2 qian of hemp seed, half an ou of honey, 1 qian of rhubarb, 10 peach kernels, and 3 fen of safflower, which is decocted in water for consumption. This formula&#39;s brilliance lies in using cooked rehmannia, gardenia, and angelica to generate yin blood, with a slight addition of hemp seed and rhubarb to moisten the intestines for flow downwards. This method, while addressing obstruction, does not urgently seek to relieve it.</p>
<p>For constipation, there are also many cases of excess conditions. This formula has remarkable efficacy in treating excess conditions. It includes 5 qian of rhubarb, 1 ounce of the tail of angelica, 5 fen of ligusticum wallichii, half an ou of honey, decocted in water for consumption. Rhubarb purges and drains, while angelica moistens, still serving as the monarch herb. Although it purges, it is not excessively forceful, thus avoiding the detrimental loss of yin. Furthermore, with ligusticum wallichii to elevate it, there is both drainage and retention, so why worry excessively!<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>Urination Difficulty</p>
<p>In cases of prolonged illness where urination is scanty or obstructed, it indicates that the kidney energy is unable to flow into the bladder. By tonifying the kidney energy, urination will naturally resume. The formula includes one ounce of cooked rehmannia, four qian of cornelian cherry, two qian of poria, and one qian each of plantain seeds, alisma, cinnamon, peony, and Chinese yam, all boiled in water to take as a decoction. The special aspect of this formula is that it does not attempt to unblock urination directly but focuses specifically on kidney water and kidney fire. If there is fire in the kidneys, the Qi transformation in the bladder will facilitate urination; thus, if urination is not flowing, it will eventually flow.</p>
<p>When urination is blocked, it is due to the Qi transformation in the bladder not functioning. The treatment should focus on the bladder meridian alone; however, the method does not solely concern treating the bladder. The formula includes three qian each of ginseng, lotus seeds, poria, plantain seeds, and shepherd&#39;s purse, twenty ginkgo nuts, one qian of licorice, and three fen of cinnamon, all boiled in water to take as a decoction. This is effective immediately. The uniqueness of this formula lies primarily in the use of ginseng, followed by the three fen of cinnamon, as the bladder must receive the Qi transformation to begin urination. What is the Qi transformation? It is the energy of the pericardium. The bladder must receive the downward flowing energy of the pericardium before the water can emerge. Particularly noteworthy is the use of twenty ginkgo nuts, which many are unaware of.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>The ginkgo nut connects all the channels, running through the governor and the constructive vessels. It flows towards the bladder, channeling the energy of ginseng and cinnamon directly into the bladder. Herbs like plantago and shepherd&#39;s purse serve to facilitate discharge, each leading to elimination from the orifice of the genitalia. This is the marvelous method for treating these organs.</p>
<p>In cases of dryness and severe obstruction, where the small intestine is too fine to allow for defecation and where the bloating is so severe that it feels life-threatening, these are conditions that cannot be treated merely as they are. What I wish to address is that the small intestine&#39;s opening and closing are managed by the kidneys. If one were to treat only the small intestine, it would become more vacuous, losing its role in transmission, leading to increased bloating. </p>
<p>Therefore, I will not treat the small intestine directly but instead focus on the kidneys. By opening the kidney qi, the small intestine will also open. The formula I propose is called &quot;Basic Treatment for Water Retention Decoction&quot;: two ounces of cooked rehmannia, one ounce each of cornelian cherry and ophiopogon, five qian each of plantago and poria, two qian of five-flavor fruit, and three qian each of achyranthes and euphorbia. Boil in water and take as a decoction. </p>
<p>With one dose, there may be slight relief; with a second dose, the intestines will relax, and urination will flow like a stream. This formula uses cooked rehmannia and cornelian cherry to tonify the kidneys, ophiopogon and five-flavor fruit to nourish lung qi, thereby promoting the downward flow of clear and purifying energy to the bladder; poria and plantago help disperse water accumulation; achyranthes and euphorbia utilize their swift properties to guide the downward flow without causing obstruction above. This is how the kidney qi facilitates water movement smoothly.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>Prescription for Ma Ren Pill: Treats heat and dryness of the stomach and intestines, resulting in constipation. </p>

<p><strong>Gate of Urination and Defecation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture and Moxibustion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Needling the area three inches below the inner thigh leads to involuntary urination. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: The Sanjiao (Three Burners) is where the lesser yang and the greater yin of the foot converge; it is distinct from Taiyang (Greater Yang). Five inches above the ankle, it separates into the intestines, exits at Weiyang, and enters the bladder, connecting to the lower jiao. If it is full, it causes urinary retention; if it is deficient, it results in involuntary urination. For involuntary urination, tonify; for urinary retention, drain.</p>
<p>When Qi collapses and affects the throat, causing inability to speak, with clear hands and feet, and difficult defecation, one should target the foot&#39;s lesser yin. When there is absence of Qi but the abdomen feels heavy, with internal coldness and difficulty in urination and defecation, target the foot&#39;s greater yin.</p>
<p>The channel of the hand&#39;s greater yin, known as Lieque, begins at the wrist and travels along the greater yin channel, directly entering the palm, dispersing into the area between the fingers. In cases of excess, there is sharp pain and heat in the palm; in deficiency, there is frequent involuntary urination. Needle half an inch from the wrist to follow the pathway of Yangming (Greater Yang).<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>The foot Shaoyin channel is known as the Great Clock. It winds around the heel behind the ankle and branches off to the Taiyang; its branches run above, traveling under the Heart Protector, and outward connect to the spine. When there is rebellious qi, it causes irritation; when full, it leads to urinary retention, while in deficiency, it results in low back pain. The points to be used are at the branches.</p>
<p>For lower abdominal pain and swelling with difficulty urinating, if the obstruction is in the Sanjiao, use the Taiyang Great Luo point. Observe its connecting vessels and the blood with the Jueyin small vessels. If the swelling ascends to the stomach area, use the point at Sanli.</p>
<p>For urinary retention, use Yin Qiao and San Mao above, along with points for blood vessels that are bleeding.</p>
<p>For abnormal urination and defecation, treat the symptoms; if there is normal urination and defecation, treat the root cause. </p>
<p>If there’s first difficulty in urination and then other diseases arise, treat the root. </p>
<p>With insufficient central qi, urination and defecation are affected, and the intestines make uncomfortable sounds. Restore sufficient energy below the outer ankle and retain the treatment there.</p>
<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states that in cases of Sanjiao diseases, the abdomen is bloated and full of qi, especially the lower abdomen is hard, with difficulty in urination and urgency; if there is overflow, it leads to water retention, and if retained, it leads to bloating. The point to observe is outside the foot Taiyang&#39;s Great Luo, located between Taiyang and Shaoyang, and can also be felt in the pulse; use the Weizhong point.</p>
<p>If the lower abdomen is full and painful, it ascends to the chest reaching the heart, causing a feeling of discomfort and oscillation, accompanied by fluctuating cold and heat, and difficulty in urination; use the foot Jueyin point.</p>
<p>If the bladder cannot expel urine and the lower abdomen is full, it is governed by the Guanyuan point.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>Difficult urination, fullness of water, little output, inability to pass urine, governed by the bending bone. </p>
<p>Acute fullness in the lower abdomen, ineffective urination, and qi counterflow to the head, governed by the leaking valley. </p>
<p>Difficult and painful urination, turbid white discharge, sudden hernia, swelling in the lower abdomen, cough and vomiting, sudden contraction of the yin, lower back pain that limits movement, dark complexion, heat, fullness in the abdomen, body heat and pain in the extremities, governed by the space between the tendons. </p>
<p>Fullness in the lower abdomen, heat causing inability to urinate, governed by the five miles. </p>
<p>Fullness in the lower abdomen, ineffective urination, governed by the spring of the surge.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>When the muscles are tense and the body feels hot, the lower abdomen is firm and swollen, often feeling full, urination is difficult, and the buttocks and thighs feel cold, with pain in the hip joint radiating to the side, there is internal blockage, treated by the eight acupoints and Weizhong. </p>
<p>If there is cold in the yin, urination is not smooth, treated by Chengfu. </p>
<p>For internal blockage preventing urination, needle the foot&#39;s lesser yin and the sun above the sacrum with a long needle. If qi is reversed, address it through Taiyin and Yangming points. </p>

<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: For the method of guiding when bowel movements are not smooth, press the tongue against the roof of the mouth, maintaining calmness and silence while the fluid is generated on its own. Wait for the mouth to fill with a red dragon stirring, frequently cough and swallow, and listen as it descends directly to the elixir field. Then maintain stillness and swallow several times, and the large intestine will naturally moisten, enabling the subsequent workings to be effective.</p>
<p>For the practice of moving energy: with the left hand on the navel, direct intentions to rotate and open the five organs backward, allowing the pathway of the large intestine to run smoothly; or raise the kidney water to wash and moisten the large intestine and promote expulsion. Cover the navel with the hand, again push the five organs backward to clear the pathway of the large intestine; or raise kidney water to cleanse and purge the large intestine.</p>
<p>For the guiding method of the tailbone’s energy descent: clench your teeth, hold your breath, raise your shoulders, open your eyes wide, and turn your head left and right while tightly clenching the buttocks; by doing so, the energy will naturally rise. </p>
<p>The practice: The sign of the primordial energy sinking is when the expelled gas does not have a foul odor. Since holding the breath during practice prevents the energy from rising, one should adhere to the method of returning to the primordial source, completing a full circuit for seven days to see results.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>When using effective techniques targeting the tailbone and the dual acupuncture points along the spine, if one cannot summon the energy and it falls away, it is advisable to employ quiet practices of introspection to naturally rise to the crown without attachment. The method for guiding the small water when it is stagnant involves rolling a small paper into a point and inserting it into the nose, waiting for a sneeze to clear the blockage. If stagnation persists, rub the palms and the Yongquan point, calming the fire and settling the spirit, or practice circulation techniques for effect.</p>
<p>The method of circulation and the small intestine condition can be treated in the same way, following the principle of returning to the source. Rotate and move downward, then reach the affected area, moving in this manner several dozen times, then spiral upward, dispersing and surrounding it continuously, repeating the process gradually, purifying the passage and maintaining calm.</p>
<p>For guide pressure on the urinary canal: press on the Kan point with a finger and perform circular motions twenty-four times, while mentally inhaling from above the spiritual center, rotating the energy around, returning to the source with each cycle, and then drawing it upward three times for breathing practice, combining the movement techniques for effect.</p>
<p>With regards to the movements: those affected by seated meditation should focus their thoughts on the sea of qi for a while, then silently rotate and circulate, moving yet still, constantly mindful, allowing the energy to consolidate. The method of returning to the source involves directing the intention upward, rotating and transforming the essence from left to right, first moving the navel wheel, collecting and releasing, releasing and then collecting, returning to the original state, never departing from this, and the thoughts naturally return to their true origin.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Confucian Door to Filial Piety&quot; states: A man named Dai visited his relatives in Cao Nan and found that his cousin was suffering from severe constipation. There were no other symptoms; he often dared not eat to fullness, as doing so would lead to extremely difficult bowel movements, with stools as hard as iron or stone. Sometimes, he would go three to five days without a bowel movement, and when it occurred, it was painfully difficult. Blood would come from his nose, and he experienced pain in the anus and rectum. The pain was so extreme that it would cause fainting. When he took medicine, his condition worsened. He had tried various harsh laxatives like croton seed, bitter herb, and euphorbia, but excessive use only led to exhaustion, and stopping the laxatives led to dryness returning, resulting in this suffering lasting for several years. Frightened of the violent effects of these medications, he merely lay in bed and awaited death.</p>
<p>When Dai arrived, he took the pulse of both hands and found it smooth, solid, and strong. He then administered a dose of the Big Cold Purging Decoction, followed by the Divine Efficacy Pill and Hemp Seed Pill. He instructed him to eat dishes made from soft vegetables and pig or beef blood, and after over a hundred days, his weight increased significantly, shocking his relatives.</p>
<p>Alas! Inexperienced practitioners fail to recognize that dryness can be categorized into four types: external dryness manifests as wrinkled skin, internal dryness leads to depletion of essence and blood, upper dryness causes dryness in the throat and nose, while lower dryness results in constipation and urination difficulties. The disease of dryness arises from the transformation of the yangming, due to a cold and scanty presence of fluid. Thus, purging is necessary, but the right medicine must be chosen. For instance, croton seed can purge cold, bitter herb and euphorbia can relieve dampness, and rhubarb along with saline can purge dryness. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;Use warmth to moisten,&quot; and &quot;Use salty to soften.&quot; The &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; mentions: &quot;Use slippery substances to nourish the orifices.&quot;<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>Recently, there was an elderly man aged eighty. His internal organs were sluggish, and he had not been able to attend to his bodily needs for several days. Each time he felt the urge, he found his spirit dimming, his head spinning, his nose blocked, and his waist in pain. Gradually, his condition worsened, and although he could eat, his stool became hard and dry like a pellet. One day, a friend recommended that he eat a soup made from blood stuffed with vegetables and oil-fried amaranth greens. He began to eat this daily, and soon he experienced relief both before and after eating. His spirit brightened with the food, and he lived to ninety years old, passing away without illness. The &#39;Illustrated Treatise&#39; states: Spinach is cold and beneficial for the intestines and stomach. Sesame oil, when stir-fried and consumed, facilitates bowel movements. Amaranth relaxes the intestines and aids in urination. For elderly people, difficulties in urination and defecation are urgent matters; thus, this method of relief is indeed a fortunate find.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>Tai Kang Liu Cang suffered from a condition of frequent but scant bowel movements, going up to seventy or eighty times a day, and habitually suspended a small vessel between his thighs for over ten years. A bystander laughed and said, &quot;Since your condition is frequent yet scant, desiring to relieve yourself but unable to do so, why not take a strong laxative?&quot; This suggests that the term &quot;relieve&quot; encompasses more than just ease. This was the effect of a single dose of medicine. He then took a powerful laxative that caused over thirty bouts of relief, after which he immediately stopped.</p>
<p>The &quot;Eastern Garden&#39;s Ten Writings&quot; states: In ancient Chang&#39;an, there was a wealthy merchant named Wang Shanfu who suffered from urinary obstruction, gradually developing abdominal fullness. His belly was hard as stone, and he faced extreme blockage with swollen legs and feet that burst, leaking yellow fluid, while his eyes protruded. Day and night he could not sleep, unable to eat, suffering indescribable pain, and he sought my treatment. I inquired about the onset of his illness; he mentioned he felt no thirst and had bouts of severe vomiting. Various doctors all prescribed treatments for abdominal fullness and diuretics. Faced with an urgent situation, I returned home, and through the night until dawn, I was restless, pondering the matter deeply. Suddenly I recalled the &quot;Suwen&quot; stating: &quot;Without Yang, Yin cannot thrive; without Yin, Yang cannot transform.&quot; It also states: &quot;The bladder is the official responsible for the regions, where fluids are stored, able to expel when qi transforms.&quot; This illness of urinary retention is due to the absence of Yin, preventing the transformation of Yang energy. All diuretic medicines are light and infiltrating, representing Yang. They merely promote qi, being Yin within Yang, but not transforming from the cold Yin of northern water.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>This is due to excessive nourishment, with rich foods accumulating heat, damaging the Northern yin, resulting in insufficient kidney water. Consequently, the bladder and kidney chambers become dry over time, and urination is not transformed, with fire rising to cause vomiting, which is not a condition caused by obstruction above. It is specifically related to the &quot;guan&quot; (barrier), not a disease of obstruction. The ancient elder Jie Gu stated: with heat in the lower jiao, it fills and obstructs. This is the method for treating obstructive conditions. The patient presents with both internal and external obstructive diseases, facing imminent death, yet treating the lower jiao may lead to recovery. One should adapt to the transformation of cold water from the North, using bitter cold herbs that are entirely yin, such as Huanglian, Zhimu, and Gui, formulated into pills the size of tung seeds. Boil them in water and take two hundred pills; shortly after taking the medicine, the anterior yin will feel as if stabbed by a knife and burned with pain, the urination will gush out like a waterfall, soaking the bedding, forming streams beneath the bed, and swelling will dissipate upon careful observation. I expressed my surprise, saying: &quot;Great are the words of the sage! How could one not thoroughly examine them and cling to but one!&quot; The evidence shows that when urination is obstructed but there is no thirst, and there are signs of agitation, this is it. Generally, all illnesses in the lower jiao do not present with thirst. The two types of illness, concerning qi and blood, are easiest to differentiate.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: Yang Chun had severe constipation, with urination normal, the throat obstructed, and phlegm appearing after eating. The pulse was thin, and both hands were the same. This is a severe case of spleen qi deficiency leading to dry intestines, for which Ren Shen San is the main treatment.</p>
<p>A woman experienced abdominal pain and later suffered from obstructed urination and defecation. This is phlegm blocking the middle jiao, with qi stagnation in the lower jiao. Using Erchen Decoction with Mutong, she initially took it and swallowed after decocting.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>Lu Zhongnian was sixty-six years old when he fell ill with a cold and fever. After the heat subsided, his pulse remained strong and rapid. This rapid pulse was analyzed as weak, and he was given a mixture of ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, roasted licorice, angelica, peony, and dried citrus peel for several days, but his pulse remained large and did not settle down. Additionally, he had difficulty urinating and experienced a distended sensation in his lower abdomen, which greatly troubled him; he could only manage to urinate by lying on his back. I said that the nourishing medicine had not yet reached him. I then doubled the dose of astragalus and ginseng, and after two days, his urination improved.</p>
<p>A man presented with urinary obstruction, and the doctor prescribed diuretics, which worsened his condition. Danxi said: This is due to accumulated phlegm. The phlegm accumulates in the lungs, which is the upper jiao, while the bladder is the lower jiao. When the upper jiao is obstructed, the lower jiao is also blocked. This is like a dripping water vessel; both the upper and lower openings must be clear for the water to flow out. Therefore, he used a method of inducing vomiting to expel it. After vomiting, the illness seemed to be alleviated. This shows that urinary retention is not solely governed by the channels&#39; diseases.</p>
<p>Ma Xisheng, over fifty years old, had a fondness for alcohol and frequently drank heavily. The sediment would exit through the mouth, while urination occurred through the lower orifice. His six pulses were deep and sluggish. He was treated with the Four Substances Decoction, enhanced with peppermint, areca nut, peach kernel, and akebia, and he recovered. This man had excess alcohol, which harmed his vital energy; the alcohol ascended without descending, leaving his yang extremely deficient. Long-term alcohol consumption accumulated moisture and generated heat, depleting the blood and also exhausting the yin. Both yin and yang being deficient can be replenished. This man, since his middle age, could still survive when both yin and yang were temporarily weak, due to his robust build and the vitality still present in the alcohol he consumed. However, after three months, he was bound to die. Eventually, this indeed happened.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>A person aged forty is experiencing dry mouth and frequent urination. At the end of spring, a remedy was sought in the summer; pulse readings indicate dryness, the right pulse is slightly rapid but not wiry, strong yet somewhat forceful, while the left is slightly heavy, a bit weak, and not strong. However, the dryness in the left pulse is more pronounced than in the right. There is a preference for warming rich foods; this is referred to as phlegm-heat. The patient should avoid rich flavors, reduce fire to clear the metal element, suppress the liver and nourish the spleen, taking twenty-one pills of the Three Supplements, five pills of Yuanming powder, five pills of Ejiao, swallowed with ginger soup, six times a day. Additionally, a decoction of the Four Substance Soup with added ginseng, astragalus, dried tangerine peel, sweet licorice, five-flavor fruit, and ophiopogon should be taken three times a day, alternating with the pills. In one or two days, the patient feels clearer, urination decreases by two-thirds, mouth dryness diminishes, thirst remains unresolved, and there is dizziness and eye strain; prolonged sitting results in lower back pain. Consequently, they used Yao Yao Dan to treat the back pain and continued with the Four Substance Soup, reducing Chuanxiong, adding ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, achyranthes, five-flavor fruit, roasted rhubarb, and ophiopogon, boiling to prepare Liu Yi San. They then noticed increased urination, which led to discontinuing Liu Yi San while continuing with the pills.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>A woman experiences a blockage in urination with a pulse that is thin and weak; when re-examined, it feels string-like. The left side is slightly harmonious. This condition arises from worry and strain. The thinness indicates a deficiency of blood and an excess of qi; a lack of blood causes the womb to sag, while an excess of qi leads to fluid stagnation. When the middle burner is not clear and overflows, the womb senses the need to retreat and thus descends. </p>
<p>To treat this, use the Si Wu Decoction with additions of ginseng, atractylodes, banxia, dried tangerine peel, licorice, and ginger. Administer it on an empty stomach, and concurrently induce vomiting through finger exploration. Wait for the qi to stabilize before giving further doses, and repeat this up to eight applications until the patient feels well. This approach seems to have worked by chance; afterwards, I treated several others with the same method, and all benefited.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>An old man suffered from difficulty urinating. He had taken diuretic medicine excessively, which led to obstruction, resulting in a drip of urine. I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to address his sinking stomach qi, and after one dose, he was able to urinate. Because he had previously overused diuretics, his kidney qi was depleted, leading to post-urination dribbling that lasted all night. I urgently needed to tonify his kidneys, and then he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Handbook of Health&quot; states: The Right Assistant of the Zhongshu Department suffered from frequent and insufficient urination, with over twenty occurrences day and night, accompanied by abdominal distension and heaviness in the lower back and limbs, preventing him from resting comfortably. In the late spring of the Yuan Gui Wei year, I was ordered by the Emperor to treat him and went to diagnose him. His pulse was deep and slow, sometimes showing a few beats. I noted that there are three types of patients with poor urine output, which cannot be generalized. The first situation is when fluid mainly seeps into the intestines and stomach, leading to diarrhea while urine is scant; this can be resolved with diuretics. The second is when heat affects the lower jiao, causing fluids to become hot and stagnant, preventing them from flowing; in this case, drainage would be beneficial. The third is when the spleen and stomach qi is stagnant and failing to open the water passage, thus not transmitting to the bladder for transformation; this can be rectified by smoothing the qi to facilitate movement. The Right Assistant, accustomed to rich foods, accumulated dampness and heat internally, which hindered transformation, resulting in obstruction of the bladder, hence the frequent yet deficient urination. Unless there is drainage, he cannot achieve relief.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>Thus, it is prepared as a formula named Fu Ling Hu Po Decoction. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: sweet, gentle, and mildly permeating. When heat obstructs the body’s fluids, causing abdominal distention and fullness, it must be eased. This easing must primarily rely on sweetness and mildness. Therefore, Fu Ling is used as the chief ingredient. Hua Shi is sweet, cold, and smooth, facilitating the orifices, while Zhu Ling and Hu Po are mild and help to drain and benefit the water pathways, hence these three are used as assistants. The spleen is averse to dampness; when dampness accumulates, the spleen&#39;s function cannot be restored. To augment the spleen and combat dampness, sweetness must assist; thus, Gan Cao and Bai Zhu are employed as deputies. Salty flavors enter the kidneys; the salty taste promotes drainage, and Ze Xie’s saltiness helps drain the stagnant water. The kidneys are also adverse to dryness;辛 (spicy) flavors must be consumed quickly to moisten them. When body fluids do not flow, spicy substances can disperse them. Gui Zhi is spicy and disperses dampness while moistening dryness, which is the rationale for their use; hence these two are used as messengers. Decoct long and with sweet and soft water to avoid aiding kidney energy. Prepare a significant quantity of the decoction, allowing it to reach below and act swiftly. Reduce the dosage to half for two administrations, and within ten days, significant improvement will be observed.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>The &quot;Essential Treatise on Medicine&quot; states: In our town, Zhao Dexiu&#39;s mother, over fifty years old, was small in stature and suffered from hard constipation, with little appetite and pain in her lower abdomen. She summoned me for diagnosis and treatment. All six pulse readings were deep and bound, indicating blood deficiency. I prescribed a modified Shiquan Dabu Tang with added peach kernel, sesame seed, and roasted rhubarb. After several doses, there was no relief, but the fullness and discomfort increased. I then gave her Dongyuan&#39;s Zhi Shi Dao Zhi Wan and emergency Da Huang Wan, but after taking the medicine, she promptly vomited it out; her stomach&#39;s energy was weak and could not retain quick-acting medicines. Therefore, I wrapped the emergency Da Huang Wan in yellow wax and pierced it with a fine needle, instructing her to take three pills. The wax coating prevented it from aggravating her stomach energy, allowing it to pass through the pylorus and reach the small intestine to take effect. The next day, she expelled about a liter of hardened stool. Subsequently, I adjusted the Shiquan Dabu Tang to make a decoction to help her swallow the laxative pills. After a month of such adjustments, her bowel movements returned to normal, her appetite improved, and she regained stability.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>My great-grandson, suffering from smallpox, was constipated for twenty-five days after recovering from the sores and did not have a bowel movement. The pain at his anus connected to the large intestine was so intense that his cries could be heard by the neighbors. External doctors and I, along with two or three other people, deliberated on using soapy powder and honey infusion methods, along with large and small purging decoctions and pills to guide out stagnation, which proved ineffective; nothing came out. I said: “This is residual poison from the smallpox, with accumulated heat and stagnation between the large and small intestines.” I had him drink a large cup of scented oil from morning until evening, but it still didn&#39;t work. I devised a plan and instructed a maid to hold scented oil in her mouth, using a small tube to insert into the anus, and then blow the oil inside. After a while, the patient reported that the oil moved through the intestines like an earthworm gradually rising. After some more time, he passed out one or two liters of dark feces and then felt relieved and calm.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>Xiu De, at the age of seventy, suffered from urinary retention for over twenty days in autumn, and all treatments proved ineffective.

<p>The &quot;Medical Principles&quot; states: There is a man in the neighboring house who urinates dozens of times a day, with the color resembling thick rice water, feeling disoriented, emaciated, and with a reduced appetite. He was prescribed a powder made from mulberry silkworms, which brought him peace before he could finish one dose. This medicine can calm the spirit, stabilize the mind, and treat forgetfulness. For frequent urination, it strengthens heart energy using equal parts of mulberry silkworms, acorus, dragon bone, ginseng, Poria, Dang Gui, and prepared turtle shell, ground into powder, and mixed with ginseng decoction, to be taken in a dose of two qian.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Medical Classics&quot; states: The Steward Jiang Tian&#39;an took a decoction of five additives and subsequently suffered from constipation for four days, with abdominal distention and discomfort. After taking one qian of Da Huang, he was able to pass stool but became constipated again. I said: The kidney energy is weak, and the bodily fluids are insufficient; mistakenly promoting evacuation only worsens the dryness. Using Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, I prepared it with one sheng of human milk and five qian of honey; after three doses, he had relief and recovered in ten days. </p>
<p>A literati, Gu Yizhen, had a long-standing wind-related illness with constipation that persisted for years, and he sought treatment. I said: This is called wind constipation. To treat wind, one must treat the blood; this is the fundamental principle. I used a tonic soup with ten complete herbs, adding Qin Jiao, Ma Ren, Xing Ren, Fang Feng, and roasted Zao Jiao Ren, and it was effective within half a month. After three months, he never suffered from it again. </p>

<p>Literary figure Yu Yuanqian had been distressed for ten days and suddenly experienced incontinence. All the physicians prescribed tonics for the bladder and kidneys, but after a month, her condition worsened. I told her: when I lift your six pulses, they feel soft, but they are firm upon pressing; this indicates hidden heat in the yin of the kidneys and liver. I used two qian of peony root and white poria, along with eight fen of ginseng, six fen of licorice, and one qian of coptis, decocting these together. I mixed it with yellow chicken intestines and she took six doses and felt better. </p>
<p>A physician from Wumen suggested that after recovery, she should take a substantial tonic. However, a few months later, she faced incontinence again and came back for treatment. I explained: the liver has a history of depressed heat, and it needs warm nourishment to stabilize. I then prescribed Long Dan Decoction to clear the liver heat, adding yellow chicken intestines.

I said: The right pulse is large, indicating that metal dryness cannot generate water. I prescribed five qian of Zihuan, three qian of Maidong, ten pills of Wuwei, and two qian of Renshen. After one dose, urine flowed out like a spring. If more diluting medications are used, the dryness will become even more urgent; this should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>My elder brother Nianshan, demoted and stationed in Zhejiang for inspection, was in a state of resentment and during the height of summer, he experienced difficulty urinating and was breathless. Knowing a bit about medicine, he took Wailing Decoction four times, but it was ineffective. I said: The six pulses show a blockage; this is due to qi stagnation. I used eight qian of Zhike and five slices of fresh ginger, boiling them over a strong fire. After one dose, there was slight improvement, and after four doses, he was completely relieved.</p>
<p>Xiaolian Yu Yanzhi, worn out from compiling the local annals, suddenly felt as if he had lost his spirit and experienced difficulty urinating. Upon examination, I noted: The pulse is weak at the inch and strong at the cubit, indicating that water is depleted and the spirit is injured. I prescribed two qian each of Dihuang and Zhimu, three qian each of Renshen and Danshen, one qian and five fen of Fuling, and one qian of Huangbo.

His constipation worsened, and he felt weak. I then prescribed supplements for Qi and Six-flavor Rehmannia, and after a month of treatment, he felt well again after a year.</p>
<p>The official Meng had shortness of breath and phlegm problems, and after taking spicy and aromatic medicines, he developed excessive phlegm and urinary issues. His pulse was floating and large, and when pressed, it felt almost nonexistent. I believed there was a deficiency in the kidney unable to assimilate the Qi back to its source, with excessive dryness caused by the aromatic herbs. After three doses of the Eight Flavor Pill, he recovered.</p>
<p>An elderly scholar had wind-heat symptoms, maintained normal eating habits, yet had not had a bowel movement for seventeen days. His abdomen was not swollen, and his pulse was floating, large, and weak. This indicated internal Yin Fire consuming bodily fluids. I prescribed over twenty doses of the Six-flavor Pill, and it took until the thirty-second day for him to have the desire to go. I used pig bile to moisten and clear his bowels.</p>
<p>A seventy-three-year-old woman suffered from phlegm, wheezing due to internal heat, and had not had a bowel movement for two months, with insomnia. Her pulse was large and strong, yet weak upon heavy palpation. This indicated a deficiency in the liver, lungs, and kidneys. In the morning, I prescribed the Six-flavor Pill, and in the evening, the Free and Easy Wanderer Powder, each for over thirty doses. After consuming a hundred or so bowls of food, her abdomen began to feel distended and uncomfortable. I then used pig bile to guide and clear her bowels, and adjusted her treatment with the Supreme Ginseng and Astragalus Combination for stabilization. If any previous medications were omitted, or if she did not eat, her symptoms would return.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>A man in his fifties, due to anger, ate little and had difficulty with bowel movements. After taking a laxative pill, he experienced constipation, chest and side pain, and wished to also take a pill for strengthening the spleen. His pulse was floating and thin in the liver, spleen, and kidney. I said: This indicates a deficiency of the three yin&#39;s essence and blood. Doctor Dongyuan said: If a person has a strong stomach but a weak spleen, it restricts the bodily fluids. When they cannot be distributed throughout but instead are directed to the bladder, resulting in frequent urination and difficulty with bowel movements, use the spleen-strengthening pill. If a person has dry yin blood with inner heat burning, the lung metal suffers from evil, and the earth is injured by wood affecting the spleen, causing the lungs to lose their transmission, then if there is constipation with frequent urination, use the laxative pill. Now, nourishing the source of transformation will naturally adjust the bowel movements. Follow this method, and it will be proven effective.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar, with feelings of depression and setbacks due to an unfinished task, developed a fever and thirst, and felt discomfort in his chest and diaphragm, along with decreased appetite. He took remedies to clear heat, transform phlegm, and move qi, but his prior symptoms worsened, and he felt fatigued with stagnation in the heart and spleen pulses. This indicated a change due to spleen damage from depression. Therefore, he was given a modified Gui Pi Decoction, and gradually, his appetite improved and symptoms receded. However, his bowel movements remained sluggish, and his cheeks were flushed red, indicating deficient kidney and liver heat harming yin blood. He was treated with Ba Zhen Decoction plus epimedium, ophiopogon, and schisandra for more than thirty doses, and his bowel movements became normal.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>A man suffered similarly as before, disbelieving my words, took large doses of rhubarb and other medications, experienced diarrhea and bloody stools, and his body turned dark.

He refused treatment, and later that was indeed the case.</p>
<p>Zheng Fang, aged over sixty, first experienced constipation and took internal purgatives. Later, he had little appetite, felt bloated in the chest and abdomen, experienced pain in both sides, felt fatigued, and his pulses were wide at the distal points and thin on the left side, while the right side was wiry. It was May when he sought treatment. I concluded that the fire at the gate was weak and could not nourish the spleen, while the lung metal was suppressing the liver wood, fearing he would not recover during this strong metal phase. Later, that was indeed the case.</p>
<p>Liu Tianxi had internal damp-heat, with stools being slippery and urine being difficult. After taking mild diuretics, the situation worsened, causing swelling in the lower abdomen and knees, and his eyes felt swollen and painful. This indicated kidney deficiency with heat in the lower jiao; taking mild diuretics harmed the yang energy, leading to no transformation of the yin. Thus, I prescribed Rehmannia and the Two Kidney Pills, but urination remained the same; I then added Bu Zhong Yi Qi and combined it with Wheat and Five Flavors for him to recover.</p>
<p>A wealthy merchant neglected proper diet and daily routine, resulting in dry and firm stools, and often took intestinal lubricants. Later, he experienced chest and abdominal discomfort, lacked appetite, had a dry mouth, felt fatigued, and had fever with phlegm. After taking herbs like Er Chen and Huang Lian, his previous symptoms intensified, with dripping urination, diarrhea, bloating, and reduced appetite. Taking Wu Ling and Qu Mai led to urinary obstruction, body swelling, shortness of breath, and cough. I then used Jin Kui Shen Qi Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for his recovery.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>The Grand Minister Xu Hangu, while at the South Silver Platform, became ill due to overwork, experiencing involuntary urination and disruptions. This was attributed to liver fire causing an inability to regulate the yin. In the morning, he took a tonifying formula including yam, yellow bile, and anemarrhena; in the afternoon, he took Rehmannia pills. After a month, he was completely well.</p>
<p>Minister Bian Huaquan frequently urinated, and his urine was scant, red, and painful, accompanied by dry mouth and phlegm. This indicated a deficiency of yang in the kidney leading to excessive heat. He was treated with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills and the Kidney Nourishing Pill and recovered.</p>
<p>Examiner Yang Pu&#39;an suffered from a dry mouth and frequent urination, indicating dryness in the bladder and a deficiency of yin. First, he used the Kidney Nourishing Pills to replenish yin, resulting in improved urination, followed by a combination of the Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi formula and the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills to nourish the lungs and kidneys, achieving stability.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar often experienced fevers, drank water continuously, and suffered painful and difficult urination accompanied by painful bowel movements. This was due to exhaustion of essence. He was treated with the Six-Flavor Pills combined with five flavors, along with the Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi formula, achieving recovery through strict adherence. If he experienced cold limbs and preferred warm food and drink, the Eight-Flavor Pills were recommended.</p>
<p>Liu Dacans, over sixty years of age, appeared weak and fragile, with frequent or involuntary urination, internal heat, dry mouth, and occasional coughs and wheezing. I suspected a deficiency in lung and kidney qi, so I prescribed the Six-Flavor Pills and Benefiting Qi Decoction to nourish the source of his condition. He did not trust this and instead took medicine to supplement yin and reduce heat, which caused pain in the yin or difficulty in urination. He returned to the previous medicine, and within two months, he recovered.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>&quot;The Standard for Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: In the autumn of the Jiawu year, I treated a woman aged fifty who initially suffered from frequent urination. The physician prescribed Ba Zheng San and similar remedies, but her urination did not improve, and she felt as if she was being pierced by thorns. I attributed it to dampness caused by excessive rain, believing that the pathogen remained on the surface. Therefore, I used Cang Zhu as the main ingredient and Fu Zi as an assistant to release it from the surface. After one dose, she sweated and her urination immediately became smooth.</p>
<p>Ma Shen Zheng&#39;s father, aged eighty, initially suffered from short and frequent urination. After taking medicinal herbs, he experienced excessive urination leading to a complete blockage, with not a single drop coming out. I deduced that excessive consumption had harmed his stomach energy, causing his lower body to become deficient. I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and after one dose, his urination returned. Since he had previously taken too many diuretics, it had harmed his kidney energy, which caused him to experience nocturnal incontinence after correction. I urgently supplemented his kidney energy, and then the situation improved. In all medical treatments, there has never been a case where diuretic agents are not used; how could one care for the deficiency of kidney energy?</p>
<p>For cases involving stagnant blood leading to urination difficulties, it is advisable to use a lot of Niu Xi. The &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot; recounts that recently in Piling, the wife of a high official experienced an inability to urinate and unbearable abdominal swelling and pain. Numerous physicians treated her for dysuria with remedies like Ba Zheng San, yet her condition did not improve and worsened. Upon examination, I diagnosed it as blood stagnation, and no gentle remedies could resolve it. I then used a decoction of Tao Ren, which initially caused great pain around noon; shortly after, several blood clots the size of fists were expelled, and her urine flowed like black bean juice in one to two sheng, relieving the pain. This medicine is potent and should be used cautiously for those with weak energy and blood.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>In the &quot;Examination of Medical Prescriptions,&quot; it is stated: In the late Song dynasty, there was a physician named Xiong Yancheng, aged fifty-five, who suffered from an illness causing him difficulty with urination and bowel movements. For five days, his abdomen was swollen like a drum, and his peers looked on, all unable to provide help. He was close friends with the monk Huiyue from West Lake and sent a message inviting him for a final farewell. The monk hurriedly went, encountering a strange guest at Da Qiao, who greeted him, saying, &quot;Noble man from beyond the world, why do you hurry so?&quot; The monk replied, &quot;A good friend is suffering from a severe illness and is in critical condition; I wish to inquire about his health.&quot; The guest said, &quot;It&#39;s an easy matter. Allow me to prepare a medicine.&quot; He then took off his shoes and waded into the water, retrieving a large conch shell. He said, &quot;The matter is resolved.&quot; Upon returning home, he mixed half a spoon of salt with the conch shell, crushed it, and placed it an inch and three-fifths below the patient&#39;s navel, tightly binding it with a wide cloth, and also prepared a pot for urination to assist with his needs. The monk did not fully trust this approach and politely thanked him. When he arrived at Xiong&#39;s house, Yancheng was unconscious, and his wife and children were in tears. As other doctors had no other strategies, they cautiously tried this method. Without even taking a seat, the patient suddenly relieved himself. The doctors were ashamed and dispersed. The monk returned to inquire about the strange guest but could find no trace of him. Xiong lived for another sixteen years before passing away. The master stated that difficulty with urination and bowel movements is due to heat blockages. The conch shell has a cold nature and is good at dispersing and clarifying. In murky water, one touch of the conch can clear it. The salt is simply used for its moisture-retaining qualities.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>The &quot;寓意草&quot; (Meaning of Herbs) states: Jiang Yiren obtained a strange testimony, referring to the explanation in the &quot;Shen Nong&#39;s Classic of Materia Medica&quot; regarding the treatment of intestinal disorders with the Wuling Decoction, deeming it mysterious. I observed this and clarified: the symptom of intestinal disorder involves both bowel movements, which can interchange as if they were trading. In ancient times, Wuling was used specifically to clear the front passage. If the symptoms are confined to the rear passage, with both bowel movements originating from the front, likening it to intestinal disorders indeed presents a chance of misunderstanding. Furthermore, intestinal disorders arise suddenly as a violent illness, causing chaotic qi within. This condition, in contrast, results from a chronic illness, where blood gradually depletes internally, showcasing a significant difference. How can they be compared?</p>
<p>The root of illness begins with worry and grief, which can damage the spleen. The spleen regulates blood, and if it is damaged, it cannot control the flow, leading to erratic discharges similar to excessive bleeding or loss of vitality. In such cases, great supplementation and stabilization are necessary. However, if this is mistakenly treated as excessive bleeding, using methods to cool the blood and clear fire, the outflow will only increase. One fails to consider that with the end of the Tide of Life, there is no illness present. When one is aged and qi is weak, the absence of sufficient blood to control leads to neglect.</p>
<p>As a result, the blood to the passages diminishes day by day, compelling the need to borrow resources from the large intestine, which in turn causes blood from the large intestine to seep into the reproductive organ. Over time, the blood from the large intestine also depletes, and its qi, which moves with the blood, becomes isolated and aimless, leading to chaos much like the calamities faced by the woods and waters.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>Moreover, like those who save from disaster, they strip neighboring countries to establish a desolate place that they disregard. Yet it is still not enough. When the stomach area is nourished, the blood from the stomach area is drawn and seeps into the body’s cavities; after a long time, the blood of the stomach runs out, and the blood that is expelled has no source to stop it. The blood of the stomach is what nourishes the body and fills the meridians; now that it has become dark and returns to nothingness, the grass loses its moisture and the feet suffer worry. When the blood is exhausted and stops, it is far worse than when there is blood but it flows out. Thus, after the blood runs out, the qi becomes chaotic; when the qi is chaotic, the water and grains are neglected and therefore turn to new sources, neglecting spaciousness for narrowness. The channels of the Yangtze and Han rivers converge into one path, resulting in great chaos within the body. The large intestine must reopen its original pathway to restore order, and this has no relation to the prescription of Wuling. Furthermore, since the water and grains pass from the stomach to the intestines with a separate pylorus that distinguishes between the clear and the turbid, if due to the seepage of blood there arises a grain pathway, the pylorus becomes a smooth route. Is it still possible to reopen it with Wuling? Moreover, the affliction of Wuling is deeply cautioned against by those who worry about lost blood. Nowadays, seeing a single ailment, one often has a remedy obstructing the chest; as for those who uphold established prescriptions as spiritual secrets, most tend to mislead others. If one is to address someone’s ailment, I merely need to place three fingers lightly and then ask: “Are there frequent weeping episodes?” If a maid or elderly woman replies: “I weep often,” then it is known that dryness within the organs causes excessive weeping, and the large intestine is currently useless. What of the intestinal channels? Now, if the pulse of the large intestine is evident in the fingers, is it possible to predict when the spring jujube leaves will come? When the jujube leaves sprout, the fruits can be expected.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

The insufficiency of Yang in the kidneys leads to coldness in the (less of the moon) middle.

<p>The Emperor said: There are those with a condition of frequent urination, several times a day; this signifies insufficiency. When the body feels hot like charcoal, the neck and chest are swollen, the pulse is vigorous, and there is wheezing with a reversed breath, this signifies excess. When the Taiyin pulse is as fine as a hair, this signifies insufficiency. Where does the sickness lie? What is its name? Qibo replied: The illness is in the Taiyin; its excess is in the stomach, and its deficit is in the lungs. The condition is called &quot;Jue,&quot; and if untreated, it leads to death. This is said to involve an excess in the five, and a deficiency in the two. The Emperor asked: What is meant by &quot;five excesses&quot; and &quot;two deficiencies&quot;? Qibo replied: The &quot;five excesses&quot; refer to an excess of the five diseases of qi. The &quot;two deficiencies&quot; also refer to a deficiency of qi. Now, if externally there is an excess of five, and internally a deficiency of two, then the body&#39;s condition is neither externally manifested nor internally resolved, and it is undoubtedly on the path to death.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yangming channel is characterized by dryness and heat, revealing the transformation of the Taiyin’s dampness. When the Taiyin is insufficient, the stomach&#39;s qi becomes hot, leading to an excessive and agitated pulse at the Renying point. When the stomach qi rises, it is closely related to the lungs, causing wheezing and reversed breathing. If the stomach qi is strong but unable to circulate the essence, it indicates a deficiency in the Taiyin. With insufficient Taiyin, all the five organs and six bowels fail to receive qi, leading to the fatal symptoms of reversed cold. </p>
<p>Conditions where there is an excess include a body feeling hot like charcoal, a feeling of heaviness in the neck and throat, an agitated pulse, and wheezing with reversed breath, which are signs of excess qi. The two deficiencies refer to frequent urination, with the Taiyin pulse being thin like a hair, indicating a lack of qi. Yangming governs the exterior; when there is excess in the five signs, it fails to circulate qi through the three Yang channels on the surface. Taiyin governs the interior; when there are two deficiencies, it fails to circulate qi through the three Yin channels internally. This disruption of the balance between the interior and exterior yin and yang in the body leads to certain death.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Reversal</h3>
<p>When the Taiyin is reversed, it leads to abdominal fullness (true moon) and distension, with difficulty in bowel movements. [Note: The channel of the foot Taiyin enters the abdomen and is connected to the spleen; thus, if it is reversed, it results in abdominal fullness (true moon) and distension. Food and drink enter the stomach, and the spleen is responsible for transformation and transport; if there is counterflow in the spleen, it causes difficulty in bowel movements.]</p>
<p>When the Shaoyin is reversed, it results in dry mouth and red urine. [Note: When the channels of the foot Shaoyin are in reversal, the lung metal cannot regulate downward, resulting in red urine.]</p>
<p>When the Jueyin is reversed, it causes swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, with abdominal distension and difficulty in urination. [Note: The channel of the foot Jueyin corresponds to the lower abdomen, involving the stomach and connecting to the liver and gallbladder; thus, reversal leads to swelling and pain in the lower abdomen and abdominal distension. It runs down to the inner thighs, enters the hair region, encircles the genitals, and reaches the lower abdomen, leading to difficulty in urination.]</p>
<p>Reversal of the Jueyin can cause back pain, fullness in the abdomen, and obstruction in the front. [Note: The waist corresponds to the exterior of the liver. Fullness indicates that the essence cannot disperse in the liver. Obstruction in the front pertains to the liver’s role in regulating flow.]</p>
<p>When all three Yin channels are reversed, it leads to inability to move forward or backward, causing cold in the hands and feet, and death in three days. [Note: When all three Yin channels are reversed, Yin is separated from Yang. The inability to move forward or backward refers to the downward aspect of Yin. All Yang energy arises from Yin; when all three Yin channels are reversed, life energy is extinguished, resulting in cold extremities and death in three days.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

Qi Bo replied: When the uterus transfers heat to the bladder, this leads to urinary blood.<br>[Note: The bladder is the chamber of the uterus. The Chong and Ren channels arise from within the uterus, being the sea of menstrual blood. When the uterus transfers heat to the bladder, this causes the pathogens of menstrual blood to move into the bladder, resulting in urinary blood. When there is heat, the waterways dry up, leading to urinary retention.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on the Five Constant Virtues in Governance</h3>
<p>In times of dry flow, the affliction is obstruction, as it injures the kidneys.<br><em>Note: Obstruction refers to the injury to the kidneys leading to inability to transform.</em> </p>
<h3>Explanation of the Theory of the Five Qi</h3>
<p>The affliction caused by the five qi leads to bladder dysfunction resulting in obstruction, and lack of control causing incontinence.<br><em>Note: According to the &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot;: &quot;The lower jiao (the lower energizer) is influenced by the yangming, and connects to the bladder, causing obstruction when full and incontinence when deficient. Incontinence should be treated with supplements, while obstruction should be treated with purging.</em> </p>
<h3>Major Discussion on the Six Original Constants</h3>
<p>The yangming, governing the heavens, experiences initial qi leading to yellowish-red urination.<br><em>Note: When yin is condensed externally, yang becomes stagnant internally, causing illness with red urination.</em> </p>
<h3>Discussion on Regulating the Menstruation</h3>
<p>When the body has excess, it results in abdominal distension, and there is difficulty in urination and defecation.<br><em>Note: &quot;Jing&quot; refers to feces; &quot;shou&quot; refers to urine.</em> </p>
<h3>Discussion on the Essentials of True Reality</h3>
<p>The Taiyin governs the heavens, and the dominance of dampness results in difficulty with feces.<br><em>Note: The kidneys open to both yin paths, leading to constipation.</em> The Shaoyin governs the heavens, and the dominance of heat results in changing colors of urine.<br><em>Note: The change in urine color is due to lung channel disease, as fire dominance injures the metal qi.</em> The Jueyin’s dominance shows yellowish-red urination.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note</strong>: The color of urine is yellow and red, arising from wood’s excess leading to fire. When the lesser yang returns, thirst prompts drinking water and the color changes to yellow and red. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Thirst leads to drinking water; the yangming stomach becomes dry and hot. The taiyin damp earth governs the four energies; the color changes to yellow and red as fire and earth combine. When the lesser yang occupies the springs, the guest prevails, and in severe cases, the urine becomes white.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Severe cases leading to white urine indicate a disturbance affecting the yangming and taiyin primary energies. Metal governs energy; when energy transforms, it is expelled as urine. White urine signifies unprocessed energy leading to unclear urine. White stool arises from damaged earth energy.</p>
<p>In the year of the taiyin at the springs, there is pain and swelling in the lower abdomen, preventing urination.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Swelling in the lower abdomen preventing urination indicates a bladder meridian disease caused by excessive earth energy, leading to illness in the water organs. </p>
<p>In the year of the lesser yang at the springs, fire predominates, causing the populace to suffer from both red and white dysentery, lower abdominal pain, and red urine; in severe cases, there may be blood in the stool. The lesser yin mirrors the condition.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Heat damaging the blood results in red dysentery, while heat damaging the energy results in white dysentery. Heat in the lower jiao causes lower abdominal pain and red urine, and in severe cases, blood may come from urination. The fire of the lesser yin arises from water, while the fire of the lesser yang is born from the earth, thus they correspond.</p>
<p>The victorious influence of the jueyin leads to transformation into heat, causing urine to be yellow and red.</p>

<p>The Yellow Emperor said: I wish to hear about the functions of the lower energizer? Qibo replied: The lower energizer is the section of the intestines that diverges into the small intestine, which discharges into the bladder and seeps into it. Thus, the water and grains usually coexist in the stomach, becoming dregs that descend together into the large intestine, forming the lower energizer. They seep down together, assisting in the secretion of distinct juices, traveling through the lower energizer and seeping into the bladder.</p>
<p><strong>On the Channels</strong></p>
<p>The lung hand taiyin channel is responsible for ailments arising from the lungs. When qi is abundant and excessive, there will be pain in the shoulder and back, along with wind, cold, sweating from a stroke, and frequent urination with deficiency. When qi is deficient, there will be chill and pain in the shoulder and back, shortness of breath insufficient for respiration, and changes in the color of the urine.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The liver corresponds to the channel of the jueyin, which governs diseases originating from the liver, such as fullness in the chest, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and conditions of urine retention or obstruction. </p>
<p>When the weather is cold, the pores close, and the qi and humidity do not circulate, causing water to flow down to the bladder, resulting in urine and qi. When qi escapes, it manifests as urine; when stored in the bladder, it becomes the latent yang qi.</p>
<p>Sour flavors travel through the tendons; excessive consumption leads to urinary retention. Sourness enters the stomach, causing its qi to stagnate, thus restraining the two upper burners, preventing the necessary exchanges. If it does not exit, it remains in the stomach, and if the stomach is harmonized and warm, it descends to the bladder. The bladder, being fragile and thin, contracts when it encounters sourness, leading to blockage, resulting in urinary retention. The yin corresponds to the accumulation of tendons, hence the sourness enters and affects the tendons. </p>
<p>The sour qi stagnates and thus cannot exit from the upper burners. If it does not exit, it stays in the stomach and seeps down to the lower burner, eventually entering the bladder. The bladder is the chamber for storage, and since it is situated in the center, its constitution is fragile and thin, making it vulnerable to contraction from sourness, leading to blockage and the failure of the water pathways, hence urinary retention. The term &quot;yin&quot; refers to the anterior yin, and &quot;accumulation of tendons&quot; signifies the primary tendons, which govern the tendons.

<p>The chapter on Thirst states: When the Fuyang pulse is floating and rapid, the floating indicates qi, and the rapid indicates the exhaustion of nourishment leading to hardness. When qi is abundant, urination is frequent; frequent urination results in hardness, and when hardness and frequency clash, it leads to thirst.</p>
<h3>Difficult Urination</h3>
<p>The chapter on Damp Bi states: In Sun Disease, when there is joint pain and restlessness, and the pulse is deep and thin, this is called Damp Bi. Symptoms of Damp Bi include difficult urination and rapid bowel movements, but one should treat the difficult urination.</p>
<p>The chapter on Blood Bi states: When a man has a weak, deep, and wiry pulse, without cold, heat, shortness of breath, or inner distress; difficult urination; a pale face; occasional drowsiness; bleeding; and fullness in the lower abdomen, this is caused by overexertion. For deficiency fatigue, with lower back pain, tension in the lower abdomen, and difficult urination, the Bawei Shenqi Pills should be used. </p>
<p>The chapter on Thirst states: If urination is difficult, and there is water qi present, and the person feels thirsty, the Caoshe Louqian Pills should be used. For difficult urination, the Puhui San should be used. The Huashi Baiyu San and the Fuling Rongyan Decoction should also be used. </p>
<p>When the pulse is floating with fever, and there is thirst for water, along with difficult urination, the Zhuling Decoction should be employed. </p>
<p>The chapter on Water Qi states: When there is water in the body, the whole body and face can appear yellow and swollen, the pulse is deep, and difficult urination occurs, resulting in a water-related illness. If urination occurs naturally, it indicates a loss of body fluids, hence the thirst.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse of the foot yang should be subdued; however, it is now rapid and irregular, indicating existing heat, with a deficiency of digestion and frequent urination, yet currently unbeneficial, which suggests the onset of water retention. The cun pulse is floating and slow; a floating pulse denotes heat, while a slow pulse indicates potential. When heat and potential clash, it is called &quot;deep.&quot; The foot yang pulse is floating and rapid; a floating pulse signifies heat, and a rapid pulse indicates cessation. When heat and cessation clash, it is termed &quot;subdued.&quot; The clash of deep and subdued pulses is referred to as water. When deep, the collateral vessels are deficient; when subdued, urination becomes difficult. Deficiency and difficulty clash, causing water to move to the skin, thus it is termed water retention.</p>
<p>The shaoyin pulse is tense and deep; tension indicates pain, while depth suggests water retention, making urination challenging. If the pulse is mainly deep, it implies water presence. When the body is swollen and heavy, and the pulse indicates water disease, it results in death.</p>
<p>For those suffering from water disease, if there are small bags under the eyes, a fresh and lustrous face, a subdued pulse, and the individual experiences thirst and a distended abdomen with difficult urination, a deep cessation in the pulse indicates water, which can be purged.</p>
<p>Question: If after purging there is thirst for water, with difficult urination and abdominal fullness due to swelling, what is the reason? </p>
<p>Answer: This indicates a water disease. If urination occurs naturally along with sweating, there may be self-recovery.</p>
<p>For lung water, the body swells, urination is difficult, and there is periodic loose stool. For spleen water, the abdomen is large, the limbs are heavy, bodily fluids do not generate, there is merely shortness of breath, and urination is difficult.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

Cold water clashes, and the foot yang pulse is suppressed, food and drink are not digested, the spleen&#39;s energy declines leading to loose stools, and the stomach&#39;s energy weakens resulting in bodily swelling. The lesser yang pulse is low, and the lesser yin pulse is thin. For men, this leads to difficulty in urination; for women, it causes menstrual irregularities.

Initially, this occurs mildly, but as time passes, it becomes unnoticed.

Subsequently, the patient experienced severe vomiting, a weak and troubled stomach, a dry throat with a desire to drink water, difficulties with urination, undigested food and water, and swelling in the face and limbs. Again, a diuretic was given, leading to slight improvement, but excessive eating and drinking caused the swelling to return, with pain in the chest and sides, resembling a swelling of water, causing coughing and wheezing. First, the defensive qi should be addressed to relieve symptoms before treating the cough; once the cough subsides, the wheezing will naturally improve. New illnesses must be treated first, while old ones should follow.</p>
<p>In the chapter on jaundice, it states: If the pulse at the fuyang point is tight and rapid, the rapidity indicates heat, leading to the digestion of food; tightness indicates cold, leading to fullness upon eating. A floating pulse at the chi point indicates kidney damage, while a tight fuyang pulse indicates spleen damage. When wind and cold collide, eating food can induce dizziness, and food qi cannot be digested, resulting in bitterness and turbidity in the stomach. This stagnant turbidity flows downward, causing urinary obstruction, the yin being affected by cold, and heat flowing into the bladder, resulting in the body turning yellow, which is called &quot;food jaundice.&quot;</p>
<p>In yangming disease, a slow pulse indicates difficulty in eating enough food; if fullness occurs, it leads to annoyance, dizziness, and likely difficulty in urination, suggesting the onset of food jaundice. Even with treatment, the abdomen remains full due to the slow pulse.</p>
<p>For alcohol-induced jaundice, there will certainly be difficulties with urination, accompanied by heat in the heart and heat in the feet, which are the symptoms.</p>
<p>A submerged pulse, indicating thirst with a desire for water and difficulties with urination, all suggest jaundice.</p>
<p>With jaundice manifesting as abdominal fullness, difficult and red urination, and sweating, this indicates a balance of exterior and interior symptoms. In such cases, a purgative should be administered, preferably consisting of rhubarb and Glauber’s salt decoction.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>People may suffer from blockages after illnesses due to the change of seasons, leading to sudden death. This should not be taken lightly; therefore, it is important to detail this matter. Even if one is not gravely ill, without knowledge of medicine and dietary treatments, one may await demise helplessly, which is truly lamentable! Relying solely on remedies in haste can lead to danger. In cases of constipation, one should use oily substances and cold water to alleviate the issue. If the face appears yellow, it can be inferred that there is difficulty in bowel movements.</p>

<p><strong>Constipation</strong><br>Question: If the hands and feet feel cold and there is constipation, with dark urine, or the stool is black, and the pulse is deep and slippery. Answer: This is called a yang syndrome resembling yin. Heavy yang necessitates yin, and heavy yin necessitates yang; these are changes due to cold and heat. If the hands and feet are cold, and there is constipation, with dark urine or black stool, and a pulse that is deep and slippery, these all indicate a yang syndrome. For mild cases, use Bai Hu Tang; for severe cases, use Cheng Qi Tang. If there is cold caused by febrile illness and blood flow is obstructed, resulting in cold limbs, this indicates deep lurking heat. Therefore, the condition is severe, and one should quickly use Da Cheng Qi Decoction with additional modifications, inducing sweating for immediate recovery.  </p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: If someone has been ill with a cold for several days without having a bowel movement, and if the stool is hard and dry, it is understood that there is heat in the body. In that case, one should use Da Chai Hu and Da Cheng Qi or Xiao Cheng Qi to address it. However, Zhang Zhongjing also discusses several types of bowel obstruction that should not be forcefully treated. </p>
<p>Zhang Zhongjing further distinguishes between Yang and Yin blockages, which should not be confused. If the pulse is floating and rapid, and the person can eat but cannot have a bowel movement, this indicates a real condition known as Yang blockage, for which Xiao Chai Hu Tang is appropriate. This is said to harmonize the Ying and Wei (nutritive and defensive) to promote the flow of fluids, so that the person may finally be able to pass stool.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the pulse is sinking and slow, the person cannot eat, feels heavy in body, and the stool is hard, this is referred to as Yin blockage, for which Jin Ye Dan is appropriate. It is said that if Yang is excessive, it leads to urgency, while excessive Yin leads to obstruction; both urgency and obstruction arise from the same cause. </p>
<p>Additionally, if asked why the stool is loose, the ancients said: When the fire of the year is insufficient, cold will prevail, causing the people to suffer from loose stools. Generally, patients with cold in the intestines will have a loose stool resembling that of a duck. The reason is that the stomach is cold, and there is no distinction between water and grain. Hua Tuo stated: Cold leads to diarrhea, while heat leads to filth. Zhang Zhongjing noted two signs of initially hard stool followed by loose stool—difficulty with urination and infrequent urination, indicating that water and grain are not being properly distinguished.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Urination</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Urination is difficult and insufficient. </p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: After sweating due to a寒 (cold) illness, much bodily fluid is lost, leading to excessive dryness in the stomach, which causes difficulty in urination. When a doctor sees that urination is difficult, their tendency is often to promote it, which is a mistake. The &quot;Classified Compendium&quot; states that if the stomach is dry, there will be no urination; hence, it should not be promoted. Therefore, Zhongjing states that after purging, if sweating resumes and urination is difficult, it is merely a loss of bodily fluids. If the cold illness causes thirst, and there is heat in the lower body preventing urination, with a floating pulse, administer Wulin San; if the pulse is deep, use Zhuling Tang. If the exterior is unresolved, there is water below the heart, and symptoms include fever and cough, with fullness in the lower abdomen and difficulty urinating, use Xiao Qinglong Tang minus Mahuang and add Fuling. If there is no sweating, a sensation of heat, and strong pain in the head and neck accompanying difficult urination, administer Guizhi Tang minus Guizhi and add Fuling and Baizhu.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is vomiting and fever, fullness in the chest and sides, a feeling of heaviness under the heart, and difficulty urinating, then prescribe Xiao Chai Hu Tang removing Huang Qin and adding Fu Ling. For Shaoyin disease with difficulty urinating, use Si Ni Tang with Fu Ling. In general, when there is dampness and jaundice, prioritize promoting urination. In cases of excess sweating in Yangming, exercise caution to promote urination.</p>
<p>Additionally, if asked about difficulty urinating, the answer is: it is due to Yin deficiency. When Yin is deficient, Yang will naturally rise to meet it, resulting in excess of Yang. Therefore, if the urine is yellow, there is heat in the body. One should consider herbs like Qu Mai and Hua Shi to purge this.</p>
<p>In cases where the Taiyang disease leads to sweating and persistent leakage, and the person experiences aversion to wind, difficulty urinating, slight urgency in the limbs making it hard to bend or stretch, then Gui Zhi Jia Fu Zi Tang should be administered. For Yangming wind, when the pulse is wiry and floating with shortness of breath, abdominal fullness, pain in the sides and heart, dry nose without sweating, a tendency to sleep excessively, yellowing of the body, difficulty urinating, with tidal fever and belching, Xiao Chai Hu Tang with Fu Ling should be prescribed.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: When the sun is affected, there is heat in the lower burner, the lower abdomen must be full, and if there is difficulty with urination while urination is unexpectedly smooth, it indicates blood stasis, which should be treated with the &quot;抵当汤&quot; (Di Dang Decoction). In cases of Yangming syndrome, there is spontaneous sweating; if the urination is scant while urination is smooth, it indicates depletion of fluids. Even if the stool is hard, it should not be forcefully purged, but instead, honey should be used for gentle guidance. In cases of Shaoyin syndrome, if there is reversal and urination is smooth, it indicates a condition of vacuity and cold; use &quot;四逆汤&quot; (Si Ni Decoction) and &quot;真武汤&quot; (Zhen Wu Decoction) without Poria cocos. </p>
<p>Further, if one asks about frequent urination, it is said: Both the kidneys and bladder are vacuous, and external heat has invaded. When both channels are deficient, they become susceptible to external heat; in a vacuous state, they cannot control the flow of water, hence frequent urination occurs. If the urine is hot, the flow becomes problematic, leading to discomfort in urination, which causes frequent urination. Upon examination of the Fuyang pulse being rapid, if there is heat in the stomach, it leads to a consumption of grains and thirst for fluids, the stools will likely be hard, and urination will be frequent.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of yang brightness disease with spontaneous sweating, rigidity of the limbs making it difficult to bend or stretch, restlessness, and slight aversion to cold, if there is also cramping in the legs and frequent urination, it is advised not to administer cassia twig decoction; instead, one should use licorice and ginger decoction or peony and licorice decoction. Generally, if there is frequent urination, defecation will become difficult. Zhang Zhongjing states: when the pulsation at the foot yang vessel is floating and weak, floating indicates strong stomach energy, while weak indicates frequent urination; when floating and weak clash, the stool will be hard, suggesting a problem with the spleen, and the main treatment should be hemp seed pill. </p>
<p>If there is sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea after the onset of yang brightness disease, accompanied by slight restlessness, frequent urination, and hardened stools, use minor purgative decoction to resolve it. He further states: in cases of cold damage with floating pulse, spontaneous sweating, and frequent urination, if there is disharmony in the stomach causing delirium, administer a small amount of the adjusting stomach purgative decoction. </p>
<p>When asked about a condition with full body pain, fever, jaundice, difficulty with urination, and rapid bowel movements, the response is: this is called internal dampness. When wind and rain invade the weak, and mountain and marsh vapors rise, many people fall prey to internal dampness, which flows into the joints, causing body ache. The pulse will be deep and slow, indicative of internal dampness, which causes full body pain, fever, and jaundice, making urination easy; the treatment should be toasted wheat and aconite decoction. If urination remains difficult but bowel movements are rapid, the focus should be on relieving urination, and licorice and aconite decoction or five-ingredient powder should be the main treatments.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Enuresis</h3>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> With a swollen abdomen and heavy body, difficult to turn over, numbness in the mouth, facial dirtiness, delirium, and enuresis. </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a condition of the three yangs combined; Baihu Decoction is the main treatment. Sweating is not advisable, as it leads to delirium; purging will cause sweating on the forehead and coldness in the hands and feet. If there is spontaneous sweating, Baihu Decoction should be augmented with ginseng.<br>— From Hejian&#39;s Six Writings by Liu Wanshu</p>
<h3>Constipation</h3>
<p>Closed bowels create blockage, leading to hard stools. When heat consumes the bodily fluids, the stool becomes hard and the large intestine becomes dry and constricted. This is called wind-heat blockage, where excessive fire restrains metal, failing to balance wood, causing the liver wood to thrive excessively. Thus, if the stool is loose yet blocked, it indicates dryness and heat outside the intestines while damp heat is within, similar in principle to post-diarrhea heaviness. The transfer of heat from the large and small intestines is named &quot;li jia.&quot; When the fluids are consumed and unable to lubricate, they accumulate and the large intestine becomes blocked. Areca nut is the main remedy for this. </p>
<p>If there is pain in the lower abdomen with inability to defecate or urinate, this indicates that pathogenic qi has entered and is obstructing, preventing the movement of food qi. Zhike Pills are indicated for this. </p>
<p>For pain in the lower abdomen and bladder tenderness on palpation, if warmth exacerbates the pain during urination, and clear nasal discharge occurs frequently, it indicates that the Taiyang channel is unimpeded, allowing qi to enter from the crown, circulate to the brain, and drain into the nose, resulting in continual nasal discharge. Shen Zha Decoction is the remedy. </p>
<p>If after eating one feels as if still hungry, the stomach heat can digest grain. The Yangming channels are disturbed, with heart fire ascending, causing heart discomfort, a yellowish pale complexion, and painful, red, and constricted urination.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;True Words of the Golden Chamber&quot; states: The northern (element) is black, entering and influencing the kidneys, opening to the two yin (orifices), and storing essence in the kidneys. It also states: The kidneys govern bowel movements. When bowel movements are difficult, one should treat the lesser yin. The kidneys control the five bodily fluids; when the fluids are moist, bowel movements are normal. If one was to eat irregularly, overexert themselves, damage the stomach&#39;s energy, or consume pungent, hot, and rich foods that support the fire pathogen, this will lurk in the blood, deplete true yin, and cause deficiency in bodily fluids, thus leading to constipation and dryness. However, the condition of dryness is not uniform; there is heat dryness, wind dryness, yang constipation, and yin constipation. Additionally, there are cases of elderly individuals with qi deficiency and insufficient fluids leading to dryness. The treatment principle states: The kidneys dislike dryness; one should urgently consume the pungent to moisten them. For constipation, one must disperse it.

For energetic blockages (yang), disperse them, and for yin blockages, warm them. Zhongjing states that if there is a slight ease in bowel movement but stool is hard, one must refrain from forceful purging. Use the Spleen-Restraining Pill to moisten it. If food damages the lunar energy, causing abdominal fullness and inability to digest, accompanied by rumbling and inability to have a bowel movement, one should use bitter herbs to purge it. If blood is dry and one cannot have a bowel movement, use peach kernels and wine-prepared rhubarb to promote passage. If wind causes dryness leading to constipation, use hemp seeds added to rhubarb for relief. If there is stagnation of qi causing an inability to pass stool, use (wood-fragrant) jujube seeds, bitter orange, and soapwort seeds to moisten it. Generally, treating illnesses must investigate their source; one should not indiscriminately use castor beans or morning glory seeds to purge, as this damages bodily fluids, exacerbating dryness and blockages. Thus, further purging leads to more blockages, ultimately resulting in dire situations where nothing can be done. Ah!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The passage discusses the regulation of bodily functions and the impact of internal imbalances on the ability to urinate. </p>
<p>When the Yang energy descends from the heavens and moves through the Yin pathway, it corresponds to the western atmosphere and is connected to the intake of rich food, leading to its release. However, when the energy reaches its extreme, the Yin pathway becomes obstructed and closes off the lower passage, resulting in an inability to urinate. This indicates that the heavenly energy is unable to flow downwards. If this energy were to go against its natural course and ascend instead, it would disrupt the Yang pathway, causing stagnation in the blood vessels. Consequently, the pulse at the person’s neck would be strong and four times as prominent as the pulse at the breathing point, signaling that turbid energy is flowing in the opposite direction, hence it is referred to as &quot;the barrier.&quot;</p>
<p>In cases of alcoholic toxicity where urine is red and scant, the remedy of Wuling Powder is appropriate. If heat resides in the middle burner and has not yet affected the source of Yang, urination may be smooth and clear, indicating that bodily fluids are circulating correctly. If using Wuling Powder assists in urination, it would lead to a significant depletion of kidney water. Not only would this deplete kidney water, but it would also fail to remove the heat of alcoholic toxicity, thereby causing obstruction in both upward and downward pathways, which can lead to symptoms of jaundice. If it penetrates the blood chamber, it may result in blood stasis.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Origin of Urination</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked me: The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states that food and drink reside together in the stomach, transforming into a residue that flows down into the large intestine and forms the lower energizer. They seep down, refining and separating fluids, calling upon the lower energizer to flow into the bladder. Wang Bing explains that the water and fluids from the small intestine seep and enter the bladder, where they are transformed into urine and expelled. Yang Jie notes that the food and drink in the small intestine are received at the ileocecal junction for separation. The water then seeps into the bladder’s upper opening, resulting in urination. When reviewing these three explanations, it is clear that urination is simply the fluid that is refined and seeps into the bladder to be expelled. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: Water consumed in the stomach creates essence and energy, which ascends to the spleen; the spleen’s energy then disperses essence back to the lungs, regulating the water pathway to the bladder. Thus, urination appears to be the refined essence from water drinks, which rises to the spleen and lungs, undergoing transformation before becoming urine. These perspectives differ; upon what principle shall we rely? I say we rely on reasoning. Moreover, what exactly is urination? It is merely water. The nature of water is to flow downward. Therefore, when consumed, even though its essence and energy may rise, the original substance of the drink cannot ascend.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If it cannot rise, how can it be said that urination is solely a product of vaporization? It is only because it cannot rise that it must rely on that which can rise to lead it, which is why it is also said: the bladder stores fluids; vaporization enables it to exit. Furthermore, water is the offspring of air, and air is the mother of water; when air moves, water moves; when air is stagnant, water is stagnant. Some say that urination purely results from secretion, not from transformation, but they do not understand this principle. Nevertheless, the bladder is indeed the reservoir for fluids; it has a membrane and contains fluids within. Hence it is also said: the membrane transfers heat to the bladder. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: the membrane of the bladder is thin and delicate. The &quot;Classified Compendium&quot; states: the bladder is the chamber of the membrane. Moreover, the membrane resides in the bladder, having an upper opening but no lower opening. When fluids accumulate within the membrane, they cannot escape on their own, but must be vaporized; only then can they gradually moisten outside the membrane, accumulate in the empty space below the membrane, and consequently form urine that exits through the front passage. What the &quot;Plain Questions&quot; indicates about the bladder storing fluids encompasses the bladder as well as the membrane. Should one say that there is no empty space below the membrane, then how can a person hurry to the toilet when the urge to urinate arises? It is only when the empty space below the membrane is filled to capacity that one cannot contain it any longer, leading to an urgent need to go to the toilet. To claim that the membrane has a lower opening but no upper opening, or that it has openings both above and below, or that it has small orifices that serve as drainage routes, is indeed absurd!<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In general, the refined flavors of human beings nourish the organs; the impure aspects of various Yang energies pertain to the large intestine. The large intestine is responsible for expelling waste rather than retaining it. Now, if accumulation occurs without diversion, why is this so? There must be a reason. If pathogens invade internally, the stomach becomes dry and constipated, and if the triple burner is beset by heat, the body fluids dry up; this is the heat retained in the large intestine. A person with deficiency has cold organs and depleted blood vessels, while an elderly person has cold organs and sluggish airways; this is the cold retained in the large intestine. There could also be cases of the intestines and stomach being affected by wind, leading to dryness and constipation due to wind influence. If the qi does not descend and the digestive pathway is obstructed, if there is counterflow and fullness in the chest, there must be a corresponding condition.</p>
<p>On the discussion of the &quot;Spleen Constraint Pill&quot;</p>
<p>Cheng Wuyi stated: The term &quot;constraint&quot; refers to both binding and restricting. When the stomach is strong but the spleen is weak, it limits the distribution of fluids, instead only passing them to the bladder, resulting in frequent urination and hard stools; hence it is called spleen constraint. This pill, by alleviating the dryness and constraint in the spleen, moistens the intestines and transforms bodily fluids into the stomach, thereby achieving great ease in bowel movements and reducing urination for healing. However, I have doubts. It has been said that if there is spleen constraint, the spleen&#39;s weakness prevents movement. A weak spleen signifies a deficiency of the earth element. This must be due to the dispersion of spleen qi and the depletion of spleen blood. Tracing its origin, it arises after prolonged illness, severe diarrhea, or excessive sweating, leading to the depletion of yin blood and the internal burning of fire, injuring the vital energy and also harming the spleen, thus creating this condition. When the vital energy is harmed, the lung metal element suffers from fire&#39;s attack, and qi can no longer be contained; when the spleen is harmed, since the lungs are considered the offspring of the spleen, the depletion of the lungs leads to the exhaustion of bodily fluids, inevitably stealing maternal qi for self-preservation. When metal is consumed, wood becomes scarce and vulnerable; thus, the earth element cannot avoid injury.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the spleen fails to transform and transport, and the lungs lose their function of conduction, it leads to constipation and difficulty in bowel movements, while urination becomes frequent and unable to retain fluids. It is proper to nourish yin and blood, so that the solitary yang fire does not become excessive, and the metal can clear and control the wood pathogens. The spleen must be healthy and able to circulate fluids, as when fluids enter the stomach, the intestines become moist and passages are opened. </p>
<p>Currently, using rhubarb as the main ingredient, along with bitter orange and magnolia bark as the assistants, although peony helps nourish the blood and sesame and apricot kernels provide warmth and moisture, if used in cases of significant heat and solid qi, nothing will be stable. I fear that for people from the northwest with abundant earth energy and robust constitution, they may be able to use this. However, for those in the southeast with internal heat and weak blood and qi, though temporary relief may be achieved, it will only lead to a weaker and drier spleen. Future users of this formula must understand that in the northwest, the focus should be on unblocking, whereas in the southeast, it should focus on moistening and relieving dryness. One must be careful not to be rigid in their approach.</p>
<p>Regarding the prohibitions related to opening the bowels, I have observed that ancient formulas for relieving constipation all utilize downward-moving herbal preparations. This is because if lung qi does not descend, the bowels are reluctant to move, thus ingredients like apricot kernel, bitter orange, agarwood, and myrobalan are employed. Furthermore, for the elderly, the weak, or those with wind conditions who lack fluids and are constipated, herbs that provide lubrication are necessary, such as sesame, hemp seeds, and donkey-hide gelatin. If one rashly uses harsh purgative drugs to forcefully expel, the fluids will be depleted, and qi and blood will be consumed, leading to temporary relief but resulting in future constipation and the onset of other illnesses. </p>
<p>In the past, Wang Shaofu suffered from this illness, and there were others who treated him with harsh medicines, ultimately resulting in his lung atrophy, coughing up blood and pus, which eventually led to his death from obstruction.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

<p>Incontinence of urination is associated with heat or weakness. For heat, apply Wuling San with detoxifying ingredients. For weakness, use Wuling with Siwu.

<p>Moreover, generally speaking: the classics state that the kidneys govern the bowels, while the liver governs urination and micturition. The &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states that the small intestine corresponds to the red intestine. Hence, both the redness of the face and the color of the urine derive from the heart and the small intestine, with the southern region displaying red externally. The classics describe the lower burner as a drain, referring specifically to the excretion of both urine and feces. Feces are yang, representing tangible transformation and thus belong to the lower burner. The kidneys are considered to govern feces, without mentioning the large intestine, indicating that disturbances in this area are deemed renal disorders. Urination is yin, representing intangible transformation, and thus belongs to the upper aspect of the lower burner. The liver is considered to govern urination and micturition, also indicating disturbances in this context are regarded as issues of the bowel. All intangible transformations are under the governance of the bowels.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All entities with physical forms and vital energies are governed by organ diseases. When both conditions occur in the lower regions, they are the same, but whether they are tangible or intangible, and whether they relate to the bowels or the organs, varies. This is all due to the decline of the elixir field. The heart fire is not mentioned because its attendant fire carries out the edicts of the ruler. If we analyze further, the water of the bladder (associated with the yin) conquers the fire of the small intestine (associated with the yang); hence, it does not transmit to the yin, resulting in blood leakage. Blood leakage and excess urination are due to tangible physical maladies, and since it does not transfer to the yin, the yin remains unaffected. What is a tangible illness? This pertains to the substance of the yin and the function of the bowels. The interplay of heaven and earth, yin and yang, mutually defines substance and function, as can be observed. Thus it is clear that the five organs are utilized by the six bowels while the six bowels are also utilized by the five organs. All tangible matters ultimately relate to the transmission of the yin. Incontinence of urine and feces is due to the bladder&#39;s failure to retain, resulting in involuntary urination, which does not transmit to the yin. This is caused by the cold affecting the elixir field, being overcome by the water element (associated with the bladder). Generally, all bowels bear tangible forms, and tangible illnesses are found within the bowels, while the responsibility lies within the organs. The use of subdued fire and cinnabar serves merely to eliminate cold properties. The treatment methods are similar because they both reside in the lower regions, nourishing the intangible, as they are all within the elixir field; this is due to their connection to each other. The kidney governs defecation, and the liver governs urination. How can the treatments not be different? The classics state: the kidneys and liver are treated as one. It also states: the lesser yang governs the bones, and the resultant illnesses lead to difficulties in urination and defecation. The bladder governs the muscles, and the resulting illnesses can be understood likewise. For incontinence of urine, administer Poria Decoction.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The small intestine uniquely responds to the heart; why is this so? It is because yin cannot exist without yang, and water cannot exist without fire. When water and fire are balanced, they interact up and down, thus enabling the flow of nourishment and defense, while the water passages open and close, preventing loss of their function. However, when the heart and kidneys do not interact, and yin and yang are out of balance, internal and external pathways are obstructed, leading to water retention and loss of proper function, thus causing the water path to become slippery. If there is excess heat, urination is obstructed entirely. With slight heat, urination becomes difficult and barely occurs. When both the kidneys and bladder are deficient, external heat can take over, hence they cannot regulate water. Water mixed with heat leads to slippery conditions, resulting in frequent urination with residual dribbling. When both the kidneys and bladder are cold and internal energy is insufficient, the passages become too loose, resulting in excessive output that is pale in color, which becomes more pronounced during the night when yin is stronger. The slippery nature of urination should also be addressed by adjusting the Qi.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Secret Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The northern region is associated with the color black, which connects to the kidneys, opens through the two lower orifices, and stores essence in the kidneys. The kidneys govern the five liquids; thus, when the kidneys are functioning well, bodily fluids are sufficient, and bowel movements are moist. When the kidneys are deficient, bodily fluids are depleted, leading to dry and hardened stools. This condition arises mainly from overindulgence in sexual activity and irregular dietary habits. Excessive consumption of alcohol and spicy foods can ignite heat in the spleen and stomach, while the heat from excessive desires arises from the life gate, resulting in an overabundance of fire and depletion of water, leading to insufficient production of bodily fluids. Consequently, there may be symptoms of dryness from wind, heat, or the stagnation of energy; additionally, aging and blood deficiency can lead to dryness of bodily fluids, or due to loss of blood, there may be extreme depletion of fluids. Such variations make it difficult to draw a single conclusion. The classic states: The kidneys despise dryness; thus, one should urgently consume spicy foods to moisten them and bitter foods to drain them. For yang stagnation, scatter it; for yin stagnation, warm it.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

For wind dryness, add materials such as saposhnikovia, notopterygium, gentiana, and soapberry. These should be made into pills with honey, aiming to moisture dryness and assist the movement, thus resolving blockages and promoting flow. Additionally, one should often take tonics for blood and fluid production to support the true yin and solidify the foundation, so as to avoid a recurrence of blockages. Never resort to harsh purgatives like croton seed or morning glory seeds. While this may provide temporary relief, it will inevitably lead to worse blockages and create a root of illness that becomes difficult to treat. If there is blood deficiency, with a pulse like a scallion stalk, fever, and dry, hard stools, one must absolutely avoid inducing sweat; doing so would deplete vital fluids, leading to closures that could be fatal—this would be akin to killing the patient. The &quot;Living Person&#39;s Book&quot; describes a condition of spleen constraint where the stomach is strong but the spleen is weak, restricting the fluids that cannot spread evenly, resulting only in the bladder receiving them, causing frequent urination and difficult bowel movements. The constraint must be resolved by using pills that address spleen deficiency, thereby lubricating the intestines to transform blockages and allowing fluids to flow into the stomach for recovery.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Frequent Red and Turbid Urination</p>
<p>When there is excessive sweating and the urine is red and turbid, this is often seen during the hot months. In the heat of summer, one drinks a lot, yet the urine becomes concentrated and red, as fluid accumulates in the upper body from drinking, and it is released outward through sweat. This obstruction in the fluid pathways causes the small intestine to be blocked, preventing proper downward movement of water. </p>
<p>The formula Wuling San, also known as Daoni, contains ingredients such as Atractylodes and Cinnamon to reduce sweat, while Polyporus, Alisma, and Poria work to regulate the water pathways, drawing out what is outside to the inside, allowing for elimination. What needs to be reduced is gathered, and what is obstructed is opened—this is the principle behind it. </p>
<p>However, in cases of deficiency leading to excessive sweating and red, turbid urine, it indicates that the internal organs are dried up. Once the nourishing essence is depleted, the body cannot produce fluids, leading to the turbid and red urine. It is inadvisable to excessively use diuretics, as they will drain kidney fluids. Instead, one should focus on warming and nourishing the lungs, selecting remedies such as Shi Quan Da Bu Tang or Yang Rong Tang.</p>
<p>Sweat is a fluid of the heart. The heart governs blood, and nourishing the blood ensures the heart is nurtured. When sweating stops, fluids are generated naturally, without needing to rely on urination for cleansing. Those who have lost blood or are suffering from abscesses and toxins, and suddenly experience red and turbid urine, are also experiencing dryness and lack of moisture.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Key Points of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Constipation</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of constipation: wind constipation, cold constipation, qi constipation, and heat constipation. Additionally, elderly individuals may experience dryness of bodily fluids, which is termed a deficiency condition. Women may face constipation due to postpartum blood loss, sweating, or frequent urination; in cases where the blood and qi have not yet recovered after illness, this can also lead to constipation. All cases are suitable for using Ma Ren Wan (Hemp Seed Pill).</p>
<p>Wind constipation is caused by the wind affecting the lungs and spreading to the large intestine, making transformation difficult. Individuals with a history of wind ailments often experience constipation. It is advisable to use Xiao Xu Ming Tang (Minor Continuation of Life Decoction) with the amount of Fu Zi (Aconite) reduced and the amount of Shao Yao (Peony Root) increased, and to add approximately two shells of bamboo juice. For those with excess, take Ma Ren Wan; for those with deficiency, take Yang Zheng Dan (Nourishing Upright Elixir).</p>
<p>Cold constipation occurs due to cold air obstructing the intestines and stomach, condensing yin and causing a blockage of fluids. When the stomach is obstructed, individuals experience gas in the intestines and tend to prefer warmth while disliking cold. It is advised to use Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San (Agastache Correct Qi Powder) with equal parts of Zhi Ke (Bitter Orange) and Guan Gui (Cinnamon), and take half of a sulfur pill. </p>
<p>Heat medicine often leads to constipation; only sulfur is warming and promotes bowel movement. Cold medicines usually cause diarrhea; only Huang Lian (Coptis) is effective for stopping diarrhea by nourishing the intestines. Qi constipation arises from a failure of qi to rise and fall, leading to stagnation of food qi, often resulting in belching. The remedy includes Su Zi Jiang Qi Tang (Perilla Seed Decoction for Descending Qi) with added Zhi Ke and Yang Zheng Dan, or a half sulfur pill, or Lai Fu Dan (Turnip Pill). If these do not work, consider adding Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan (Aucklandia and Areca Nut Pill).<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To achieve rapid relief, use bitter orange peel. </p>
<p>In cases of heat constipation, with symptoms like a red face, body heat, abdominal bloating, occasional desires for coolness, or sores on the mouth and tongue, these arise from heat accumulation in the large intestine. It is advisable to take a cooling drink and swallow intestinal pills, or use a pill with agarwood and betel nut. If there&#39;s pain with gas, and the large intestine is obstructed, using a laxative will not help. If there is more of a wind-like blockage, forcing intake to relieve it may result in a recurrence of the blockage. In cases where blood is expelled alongside, one should focus on regulating the qi; once the qi flows smoothly, relief will follow. The method to regulate qi should also seek warm remedies. </p>
<p>There have been instances where purgative herbs like bitter bean failed to work, while using Dan and Fu successfully led to relief; this knowledge is essential. </p>
<p>For elderly individuals experiencing weak constipation, with symptoms like sweating, excessive urination, and lingering issues after illness, it is advisable to use a modified Suzi Qiangqi Decoction with increased doses of Gui and Weilingxian pill, or to consider Rouhuang drink or Condon broth for intestinal regulation. </p>
<p>For food stagnation causing blockage, resulting in abdominal bloating, gas, and a feeling of fullness in the chest, it is recommended to use Gan Ying Pills with bitter bean. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Frequent Urination</p>
<p>Excessive urination indicates deficiency and coldness in the lower yuan, with the kidneys failing to retain water, leading to leakage. Suitable remedies include Tu Si Zi Wan, Ba Wei Wan, Yuan Tu Dan, and Sheng Liao Lu Rong Wan.

It is similar to the spleen and kidney deficiency where there is early leakage but late recovery, recurring the next day. </p>
<p>If urination is often urgent, although the frequency may be high, the amount is typically small. After urinating, urgency returns quickly without pain—this is not a case of dysuria. It may also happen that after urination, there is a sudden need to urinate again, often due to holding back urine or during sexual activity.

<p><strong>Frequent Urination</strong></p>
<p>Frequent or uncontainable urination is often attributed to cold by ancient prescriptions, leading to the use of warming, astringent medicines. However, it should be understood that this condition can also belong to heat, in which case it is due to the chaotic movement of bladder fire, preventing water from stabilizing, resulting in frequent urination. Hence, elderly individuals frequently experience this condition due to a lack of bladder blood and excessive yang fire. The treatment should primarily involve replenishing the bladder&#39;s yin blood and dispelling the heat evil, complemented with astringent remedies such as oyster shell, cornelian cherry, and Schisandra fruit. Warming medicines should be avoided. The disease fundamentally stems from heat, thus heat should be dispelled. Additionally, insufficient water leads to active fire, causing increased urination. With frequent urination, water becomes even more depleted. Therefore, it is essential to replenish blood and dispel fire to treat the underlying issue, while using astringent measures to address the symptoms.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Compendium</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Urinary Retention</strong></p>
<p>Urinary retention, broadly speaking, is one disease that can be divided into two distinct types: acute and chronic. The acute form occurs when there is sudden inability to urinate, known colloquially as urinary obstruction. The chronic form refers to persistent difficulty urinating, where drops trickle out multiple times a day, often called dysuria.</p>
<p>When there is urinary obstruction, pain is felt in the lower abdomen, similar to the sensation of a bowl turned upside down—painful and difficult to endure. This condition arises because the intestines and stomach are dried up, and the qi in the chest does not descend. As stated in the classics: &quot;The bladder is the government of the region, where fluids are stored; when qi is transformed, it can be released.&quot; The chest area is overseen by the ministerial fire and the kidneys serve as the sea of qi. Wang&#39;s commentary states: &quot;The bladder is an organ of fluids, located within the lower abdomen, between the hairs of the lower belly. If the qi of the sea is allowed to transform, then urination will be smooth. If the qi is insufficient, there will be obstructions, and thus relief cannot be attained.&quot;</p>
<p>To treat this condition, use three qian each of clove and sandalwood, mixed with wine, or use the Eight Correcting Powder. In severe cases, it is advisable to stimulate upwards to facilitate the passage of qi, leading to natural relief. As mentioned in the classics: &quot;If the disease is in the lower part, take measures from above.&quot; Wang&#39;s commentary further explains: &quot;Heat attacking from above hinders below. When qi is abundant above, use warming and dispersing agents, and rely on bitter herbs to assist in relief.&quot;</p>
<p>If the lower abdomen is painful and distended, giving a sensation of fullness, there are two methods of treatment: if qi is stagnant below, employ vomiting techniques to lift it; if there is blood stasis below, use substances like桃仁 (peach kernel) to break it up.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

It also states: The bladder is the official governing the provinces, where fluids are stored; when they are vaporized, they can be released. From this, we understand that the bladder stores water, and the Sanjiao releases water. To treat difficult urination, therefore, acupuncture and moxibustion methods focus only on the Sanjiao points, not the bladder.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine by Li Zhan (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dry and Hard Stools</strong></p>
<p>Dryness can be categorized as wind-dryness, heat-dryness, fire-dryness, and qi and blood deficiency-dryness, which are detailed in the section on dryness. Hardness can be classified as yang hardness, where one can feel the pulse strongly, and yin hardness, where the pulse is weak and thin; there are also cases of aging with qi and blood deficiency. Dryness relates to the deficiency of yin fluids in the lesser yin organs, which can be moistened with pungent herbs. Hardness relates to the greater yin being associated with dry feces, which can be purged with bitter herbs. After a hardness has occurred, one should continue to take blood-nourishing and fluid-generating medicines to prevent recurrence and to avoid further harm to the original energy.</p>
<p>For damp-heat problems with fullness in the heart and abdomen, and with accumulated worms, one can use Borneo nut pills. When dryness and hardness occur sporadically, it indicates a real condition; when it is constant, it indicates a虚 (insubstantial condition). In cases complicated by toxins from drugs and stones, with urinary retention and abdominal distension, one can use Sanhe Powder combined with Sanhuang Decoction. In cases of food poisoning, one can use Xianglian Pills. If there is stomach fire, Baihu Decoction is appropriate. </p>
<p>Deficiency of fluids can arise from excessive sweating, overuse of diuretics, and postpartum blood loss. When blood is desiccated, one can use Wuren Pills, Shenqi Pills, or Dashengxie Pills, or Dai Zhi Tong You Decoction mixed with Borneo nut, Coptis, and dried tangerine peel. For qi deficiency, one can use Shenren Pills or Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. For those affected by emotional disturbances, Guocongchen Pills may be helpful. </p>
<p>Cold in the organs leads to qi stagnation, and cold in the organs leads to blood desiccation.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those with cold-induced stagnation or phlegm accumulation, the ancient Half-Sulfur Pill, Ancient Ginger and Aconite Decoction, and Wujisan are recommended, paired with something cold. Although these conditions may require yang medicine, if there&#39;s constipation, one should temporarily use a laxative to gently encourage movement without causing blockage.</p>
<p>In cases of emotional stagnation and heaviness, use Sanhe Powder or Liumo Decoction. For a floating pulse with difficulty in daytime bowel movements, Chenpi and Xingren can be prepared in honey pills; for a sinking pulse with difficulty at night, use Taoren instead. </p>
<p>For phlegm stagnation, Erchen Decoction with Zhiqiao and Binglang is effective. For heat injuries, use Sanhuang Pill. For cold damage, consider Dingxiang Pizhi Pill or the emergency Dahuang Preparation. If there is spleen and stomach fire, use Runchang Pill.</p>
<p>For dry obstructions, apply treatments that promote lung qi, as the lungs and large intestines are interconnected. Zhiqiao Decoction with Zisu, or Suzi Jiangqi Decoction, or porridge made from Suzi and Mairen can be effective. Additionally, in cases of spleen deficiency where the stomach is strong but the spleen weak, causing fluids to be trapped and difficult to distribute, this leads to frequent urination and difficult bowel movements, explaining the need for Spleen Deficiency Pills.</p>
<p>However, since the spleen is yin, excessive heat can consume it, causing the lungs to lose their ability to transform and transport, hence nourishing yin and replenishing blood is crucial. For strong individuals in the northwest, Spleen Deficiency Pills can relieve blockage; in contrast, those in the southeast with qi and blood deficiency should focus on moisture and nourishment.</p>
<p>Methods such as applying hot or cold compresses, immersion up to the navel, or using sesame oil for medicinal purposes are beneficial.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Difficulty of Urination</strong></p>
<p>The classic text states: When the bladder is not functioning properly, it leads to urine retention. If the nostrils are yellow in color, urination will be difficult. The kidneys govern water, storing it in the bladder and releasing it into the small intestine, which are interconnected. However, the kidneys correspond to the heart; if heart fire is excessive, it leads to heat and stagnation in the small intestine. If the heat is mild, urination becomes difficult with minimal output; if the heat is severe, urination may cease completely. The treatment should focus on clearing heat and generating fluids, using such formulas as Shibu San and Wu Ling San. If there is distension below the navel, add amber; alternatively, prepare an amber powder into honey pills, or decoct ginseng and poria to take. For those who notice improved bowel movements but still experience difficulty urinating, use Ba Zheng San with added aromatic wood. If there&#39;s severe pain in the urethra due to excessive heat, use Dao Chi San with added gardenia and rhubarb, or take Ma Zi Ren Wan, along with heat-cooling compress methods.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Constipation</strong>  </p>
<p>Studying the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; one learns that constipation is primarily attributed to the lesser yin meridian. Although symptoms may vary, they generally stem from desiccated fluids. In detail, there are different types: fullness in the stomach, deficiency in the stomach, heat constipation, cold constipation, wind constipation, and qi constipation. </p>
<p>For fullness in the stomach leading to constipation, symptoms include good appetite, red urine, and treatment with formulations like Ma Ren Wan or Shi Xuan Wan. In cases of deficiency in the stomach, where appetite is poor and urine is clear, one can use Hou Po Tang. </p>
<p>Heat constipation presents with a flushed face, rapid pulse, bloating in the stomach and intestines, a desire for cold, or sores in the mouth, treated with Si Shun Qing Liang Yin, Run Chang Wan, or Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan. For fullness, use Cheng Qi Tang. </p>
<p>Cold constipation is marked by a pale or dark face, slow and deep pulse, clear urine, preference for warmth, and aversion to cold, treated with Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San, adding Gui Zhi and Zhi Ke, or swallowing Ban Liu Wan. </p>
<p>Qi constipation results from stagnation of qi, characterized by bloating and excessive belching, treated with Su Zi Jiang Qi Tang plus Zhi Ke, or swallowing Yang Zheng Dan; if ineffective, complement with Mu Xiang Bing Lang Wan. </p>
<p>Wind constipation is due to wind affecting the lungs, transferring to the large intestine, addressed with Xiao Xue Ming Tang, reducing Fu Zi and increasing Shao Yao, and swallowing Run Chang Wan or Huo Xue Run Chang Wan.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, in the elderly, the body fluids may dry up; in women, there can be blood loss after childbirth; sweating and frequent urination may occur; and those who have recovered from illness may not fully regain their vitality, which can all lead to blockages. The method should be to nourish the qi and blood so that the body fluids can replenish and flow freely. Misusing harsh laxatives can often result in dire consequences, and the harm from substances like croton seed is even more rapid. The Eight Treasure Decoction should be augmented with perilla seed, tangerine peel, apricot kernels, and cynomorium, and the amount of angelica should be doubled. If the condition is associated with yin-cold, but the pulse is solid and slightly agitated, it is advisable to add a slight amount of warming herbs mixed with bitter cold to dispel heat and agitation, while preventing further increase in anxiety. If the yin is agitated and feels like sitting in a well, pressing down two inches will yield a sensation of vacuity, or the pulse may be thin and slow; in such cases, one should prepare the decoction and wait until it is extremely cold before consuming it. If the medicine does not produce the expected response and one does not dare to use drastic measures, one should consider using honey to prepare it. Adding five grams of salt and five grams of locust bean powder to the honey preparation will enhance its effectiveness. For cold blockages, ginger juice or fresh ginger may be used to guide it; or add a small quantity of aconite powder to the honey decoction. For heat conditions, pig bile should be used. In cases of prolonged deficiency, as a common dietary method, one should boil pig blood and organs and consume them with ghee. Blood continues to nourish blood, and organs continue to nourish organs; this is a marvelous method. I frequently observe that those in the countryside who casually use harsh laxatives suffer serious injuries in about 40% of cases, while those using croton seeds face severe harm in about 70-80% of cases; caution is imperative. Either over time the condition worsens into blockages, or it transforms into pulmonary tuberculosis with pus and blood, or results in the inability to eat and subsequent death.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Urinary Retention and Urinary Dysfunction</strong></p>
<p>Urinary retention and dysfunction are two conditions. In acute cases, it is called urinary retention, characterized by difficulty in urination. In chronic cases, it is referred to as urinary dysfunction, where there are frequent but scanty urinations. The conditions of retention and dysfunction are categorized in the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; into the liver and the governor vessel, the sanjiao and the bladder channels. However, the taiyang bladder primarily governs the storage of urine, while its expulsion is the responsibility of the liver channel, the governor vessel, and the sanjiao. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the bladder is considered the official for the distribution of fluids; when the fluids are transformed, they can be expelled. The channel responsible for transformation is the taiyin lung channel. If the lung is dry and cannot generate fluids, then the transformation cannot effectively reach the distribution organ. The treatment should focus on clearing the metal and nourishing the lungs, using herbs such as plantago, aster, ophiopogon, poria, and mulberry bark. </p>
<p>If the spleen is damp and fails to ascend essence, the lungs will be unable to generate fluids. In this case, the treatment should aim to dry the spleen and strengthen the stomach, using herbs like dahurian angelica, white atractylodes, poria, and pinellia. If kidney water is dry and heated, leading to ineffective bladder function, the approach should be to nourish the kidneys and clear heat, using herbs such as phellodendron, anemarrhena, poria, alisma, and tetrapanax. </p>
<p>Thus, nourishing the kidneys and draining the bladder is termed the appropriate treatment. Clearing the metal and moistening dryness is known as the second-tier treatment. Strengthening the stomach and drying the spleen is referred to as the third-tier treatment.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Additionally, if there is only moisture seeping into the large intestine, leading to dryness in the small intestine, one should use mild diuretics such as Poria, Polyporus, Rhemannia, and Alisma, mainly for drainage. If there is qi stagnation preventing the regulation of water pathways, resulting in water flowing down to the bladder, it is urgent to smooth the qi with herbs like Rhizoma, Akebia, and Tangerine Peel. In the case of actual heat, unless using purely Yin agents, Yang cannot be transformed. For heat in the upper jiao, use Gardenia and Scutellaria; for heat in the middle jiao, use Coptis and Peony; for heat in the lower jiao, use Berberine and Anemarrhena. If there is significant deficiency, without using warming and tonifying agents, water cannot flow, such as with Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. Dan Xi once said: “I use the technique of vomiting to help urination, comparable to a water droplet vessel; if the upper orifice is closed, the lower orifice cannot open, hence it is essential for the upper orifice to open in order for the water below to flow.” For qi deficiency, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, first ingesting then purging. For blood deficiency, use Xiong Gui Tang, also first ingesting before purging. For excessive phlegm, use Er Chen Tang, similarly first ingesting then purging. For qi obstruction, use Xiang Fu and Mu Tong to aid in purging. Moreover, if there is stagnant blood leading to urinary obstruction, use Achyranthes and Peach Kernel as primary herbs. The &quot;Prescription of Distinct Records&quot; states: “If urination is hindered, one must diagnose whether it is qi deficiency; Shen Qi Tang is effective.” From this, it can be observed that the origin of the illness does not come from a single pathway. If one does not follow the principles of observation, listening, inquiry, and palpation, attentively assessing and judging, and recklessly administers medications, how could it not be a game with human lives?<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Incontinence</strong></p>
<p>In the ordinary management of incontinence, people only know to supplement the deficiency. They do not understand that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; discusses the diseases of the liver, kidneys, and bladder without pointing to the specific evil that afflicts them. It is known that the seven emotions and six influences can all cause illness. It is also said that when the hand Taiyin is deficient, it relates to the mother-child connection in disease, indicating that the five evils, whether produced, counteracted, or uncounteracted, can all lead to illness. </p>
<p>To summarize the key points: the lungs govern Qi, which facilitates the generation of fluids, distributing them to the bladder where bodily fluids are stored, and through transformation can be released. If the water source does not stop, the bladder does not retain. These two channels are fundamentally responsible for regulation. A deficiency in the lungs indicates an upper deficiency; thus, one should tonify Qi with a formula like Ren Shen Bai Du San. If not improved, Huang Lian, Sheng Di, and Mai Men Dong should be used to clear the heat. </p>
<p>A deficiency in the bladder indicates a lower deficiency; therefore, one should use supplements like Sang Piao Xiao or similar types. In cases accompanied by cold, use Jia Jiu Zi Wan, Gu Pao Wan, Bai Fu Ling San, or Tu Si Zi San. For slippery and variable presentations, use Mu Li Wan. If there is accompanying heat, Bai Wei San or Ji Chang San can be utilized. </p>
<p>There are also cases of nocturnal enuresis that are attributed to deficiency, where infants may have fragile bladder Qi and the elderly may have insufficient lower origin, leading to numerous such conditions. In infants, those with heat account for about 70-80%; in the elderly, those with cold also account for about the same percentage. This differentiation cannot be overlooked. </p>
<p>It is advisable to prepare a large dose of Tu Si Zi Wan, crush roasted pig bladder, and decoct it to take. Additionally, one must carefully assess the presence of cold or heat to determine the appropriate treatment method.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Xue Ji&#39;s Medical Case Study - Ming Dynasty</p>
<p>Diagnosis and Treatment of Urination Disorders</p>
<p>The classics state: When the bladder is not firmly controlled, it leads to incontinence; urination occurs frequently and without awareness. The process of urination relies on the transmission of energy from both the heart and kidneys. Essentially, the heart is paired with the small intestine, while the kidneys are paired with the bladder. If the energies of the heart and kidneys are depleted, the transmission becomes obstructed, resulting in this condition. </p>
<p>The treatment should focus on warming the lower yang, clearing the heart, and minimizing desires. Additionally, complications from childbirth may injure the bladder. For those with internal cold deficiency, prescriptions like Xiyuan Dan or Jiuzi Wan should be considered. For those with internal damp-heat deficiency, Liuw Wei Di Huang Wan, possibly supplemented with Wuwei, Du Zhong, or Bu Guo Zhi, is recommended. The elderly may use a formula involving Ba Wei Wan. For those with issues arising from improper childbirth or loss of support to the bladder, a medicinal concoction like Shen Zhu Bu Bao Tang should be prepared, akin to the recipe for pig or sheep bladders.</p>
<p>I opine that the liver governs urination; if there is blood deficiency in the liver, one should use formulas like Si Wu and Shan Zhi. Should there be urination difficulties or pain in the urethra, likely due to liver damp-heat, Long Dan Xie Gan Tang is indicated. If urination is frequent and worsens with effort, it is attributed to spleen Qi deficiency; in this case, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with added Shan Yao and Wuwei is beneficial. </p>
<p>If there is a lack of control over urination or persistent dripping, it may indicate a deficiency in Yin, for which Liuw Wei Di Huang Wan would be appropriate. If urinary flow is obstructed and supplementation exacerbates the condition, this points to heat accumulation in the bladder, which can be treated with Wu Lin San. If the spleen and lungs are too dry to sustain the body, Huang Qin Qing Fei Yin can help. For bladder Yin deficiency and lack of yang generation, Zi Shen Wan should be used. For bladder Yang deficiency and lack of transformation of Yin, Liuw Wei Wan is indicated.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On the Gates of Urination and Defecation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Canon by Zhao Xianke (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Constipation</strong></p>
<p>If the kidneys are deficient and there is a sensation of heaviness in the lower body, one may feel the urge to defecate multiple times without being able to do so, often accompanied by painful sensations in the urethra. There may be instances where one is able to urinate but struggles with defecation, feeling pain instead. The treatise by Zhu’s &quot;Theory of Essence and Blood&quot; states that when essence is depleted and further exhausted, it can lead to pain in the pathways of urination and defecation; the more painful it is, the more the urge to defecate increases, and the more one attempts to defecate, the more pain ensues. It is necessary to administer a modified “Bou Zhong Yi Qi Decoction” with a doubled dose of Sheng Ma along with “Si Shen Wan”. Additionally, using “Ba Wei Di Huang Wan” while adding Wu Wei Zi, Wu Zhu Yu, Bu Gu Zhi, and Rou Dou Kou, with frequent consumption, will also yield effects. Such symptoms arise from laxatives damaging the vital energy, resulting in bodily swelling and lethargy, which is beyond count. Since the kidneys govern urination and defecation, failure in these functions is attributed to kidney issues. Therefore, can it be denied that constipation is not linked to the kidneys? The “True Words of the Golden Coffer” states: The black color of the northern direction pertains to the kidneys, opening the orifices of the two lower yin.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, when kidney qi is deficient, urination becomes difficult. It is advisable to supplement yin and promote the water pathways with herbs such as Rehmannia, Cistanche, Plantago seeds, and Poria. Additionally, one should use some warming herbs to open up the pores, facilitate the production of bodily fluids, and moisten dryness. The ancients stated: the secrets of the organs cannot be treated uniformly; there are heat disorders, cold disorders, excess disorders, deficiency disorders, wind disorders, and qi disorders. Elderly individuals, postpartum women, and those who have sweated excessively causing frequent urination, or those unwell whose qi and blood have not yet recovered can all develop restraint, and should avoid medicines such as sodium nitrate, yellow sulfur, bovine beans, and morning glory seeds. People commonly recognize heat disorders but are ignorant of cold disorders. Cold disorders arise when cold energy obstructs the intestines and stomach, congealing yin and causing bodily fluids to stagnate, resulting in blocked stomach qi. Such individuals experience excessive internal gas and prefer warmth over cold. It is recommended to brew a large dose of Ba Wei Di Huang Wan; cold beverages will help. Alternatively, one can use the prescribed Half Sulfur Pills, crushed with fresh ginger and mixed with frankincense for ingestion; or the cold-reducing Hai Zang Pills, all of which are effective. Hai Zang also notes: although the cold-reducing pills are hot, they are guided downward by the moisture of peony and fennel, allowing the yin to receive the yang and thus facilitating urination. When the warmth of spring is encountered, the ice will naturally melt.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, it is even more wonderful than the Eight-Flavored Pill. Dongyuan states: the kidneys govern the five fluids; when the fluids are abundant, the bowel movements are normal. If one experiences hunger, satiety, or excessive labor, it can damage the stomach&#39;s energy. Additionally, consuming spicy, hot, and rich flavors may cause fire evils to lurk in the blood, depleting the true yin and leading to deficiency of fluids, resulting in dry constipation of the large intestine. Furthermore, in the elderly with qi deficiency, when fluids are diminished, there can also be constipation. The kidneys dislike dryness and urgently require spicy substances to moisten them. I have followed Dongyuan&#39;s theories without using Dongyuan&#39;s prescriptions, avoiding pills and decoctions like the Moistening Intestines Pill, Moistening Dryness Decoction, and Unblocking the Ghost Dispersion. Instead, I utilized the Six-Flavored Rehmannia Pill, brewed and taken, which led to healing. In cases of heat-induced constipation combined with qi deficiency, adding five qian each of ginseng and astragalus to the previous decoction results in immediate recovery. This is because the qi deficiency cannot promote movement, and the yin deficiency cannot moisten. The above treatment methods have been personally tested and proven effective, avoiding the use of substances that break qi and blood, such as rhubarb, peach kernel, and bitter orange, allowing for long-term use without causing constipation. Therefore, I present this information.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Someone asked: Why not use the Four Substance Decoction? The answer: The Four Substance Decoction is especially effective for replenishing blood. However, if there is insufficient Tianjin fluid, it becomes difficult to use. The classics state: the large intestine governs fluids, the small intestine governs liquids. Furthermore, it is said: the kidneys control the five liquids. All fluids are transformed from the kidney water; how are they related to blood? Hence, the Four Substance Decoction is not used. </p>
<p>Another asked: In cases of severe dryness and constipation, can salts or sulfur be temporarily used? The answer: The Chengqi Decoction uses salts and sulfur specifically for instances where a cold has moved from the exterior to the interior, transforming into heat, and this heat enters the three yin, fearing that the kidneys may become dehydrated; therefore salts and sulfur are used to expel the external pathogen and quickly restore kidney water. </p>
<p>I alone prohibit their use for the elderly, those who are deficient, and those recovering from illness, as the kidney water is originally insufficient to lead to dehydration. If one were to further use salts and sulfur and similar medicines, it would multiply their deficiency; although it may provide immediate relief, it will ultimately worsen the condition. After repeated use, even iron stones may not bring about a resolution. If anyone suffers from this, they should be comforted and not allowed to act hastily, putting themselves in danger. Moreover, for the elderly, having a firm exit is a sign of longevity, which is common. If one takes the Six-Flavors or Eight-Flavors regularly, they can maintain peace without concerns.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Urinary Obstruction Should Not Be Taken Lightly</p>
<p>When urination is obstructed, it is not a trivial matter. If there is urgent pain in the lower abdomen, resembling an overturned bowl, with an overwhelming urge that cannot be suppressed, and if one has not urinated by morning, it can lead to vomiting, a condition known as &quot;Guan Ge.&quot; If the condition persists, it may even lead to death. Nowadays, when people encounter this syndrome, they resort only to Wu Ling San and end up helpless. If one applies salt to the lower abdomen or uses methods involving mole crickets or snails on the navel, that is merely a superficial remedy. If bodily fluids are excessively absorbed in the intestines and stomach, causing diarrhea while urination is obstructed, then Wu Ling San should be used to promote urination. If water is stagnant below the heart and cannot reach the bladder, Wu Ling San should also be employed to induce drainage. If the six bowels are overheated and this heat transfers to the lower jiao causing obstruction, then Yi Yuan San should be used to clear it. If energy is pressing and causing blockage, preventing normal rising and falling, one should use Sheng Ma to lift it or induce vomiting. This is similar to how water flows: if the upper orifices are open, the lower orifices will also be unobstructed.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics say: The bladder is the official of the capital region, where fluids are stored, and when the qi transforms, it can discharge. Furthermore, it says: The Sanjiao is the official of the waterways, from which fluids emerge. It is clear that the bladder can only store water; it must rely on the transformation of qi in the Sanjiao to be able to discharge water. There are cases where one has taken excessive hot herbs like prepared aconite, which depletes lung yin, causing qi not to transform; using Huanglian to detoxify and open up works in this case. There are also instances of using Poria, Chenpi, and licorice decoction to deliver powdered musk and agarwood, which also demonstrates the transformation of qi. The treatment methods above are all based on excess conditions, indicating that there is already water in the bladder; whether due to heat accumulation or qi obstruction, there is water that can be opened and discharged. In contrast, the condition of inability to discharge is associated with deficiency and excessive sweating, leading to dryness within the five organs, where fatty resources are already depleted, unable to generate fluids. In such cases, there is originally no water accumulation in the bladder, and trying to open it is akin to begging for food from someone impoverished; one who is in want will only become more destitute.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

If there is thirst but difficulty in urination, this belongs to the upper jiao&#39;s qi division. Water arises from metal; if the lungs are hot, then the source of purification is cut off. One should assist the lungs during autumn, allowing water to arise naturally. When autumn arrives and white dew falls, one must use clear metal medicines, such as Sheng Mai San. Additionally, in cases of lung deficiency, this is typically due to irregular diet that damages stomach qi and leads to a deficiency in the lower jiao. As the scriptures say, if the spleen and stomach are both deficient, the nine orifices will be obstructed. One can use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to replenish, using warm herbs like ginseng and astragalus to first regulate the stomach qi, allowing the rising and circulating energies to elevate the clear and lower the turbid. Clearing the lungs is treatment that is two steps removed; replenishing the spleen is treatment that is three steps removed.

If one is not thirsty but experiences difficulty in urination, this pertains to the lower body and blood. The lower body consists of the kidneys and the bladder; it is the deepest part of Yin. When Yin is heated and obstructed, it blocks its outflow. The scripture says: without Yang, Yin cannot generate; without Yin, Yang cannot transform. If one uses a medicine that is slightly penetrating, it is Yin within Yang, not a purely Yin remedy; how can Yang transform?

The more pain, the more frequent the urge to urinate; the more one urinates, the more pain occurs. Dai remarks: There are cases that resemble dysuria but are not, where the urine has a consistency like mucus; this indicates that both essence and urine are being expelled, blocking the urinary passage, causing pain and inability to expel. It&#39;s advisable to use Great Cuscuta Seed Pill or Deer Antler Pill. Dai also adopted Zhu&#39;s method.

It is advisable to rest and nurture the qi, avoiding labor, and to take tonics such as astragalus and ginseng; if there is no improvement, one must then consider the kidneys. The classics say: if the bladder is not controlled, it leads to involuntary urination. Zhongjing notes: when the lower jiao is exhausted, there will be loss of urination and bowel control. Additionally, if the lower jiao does not return, there will be involuntary urination. The lower jiao is at the opening of the bladder, responsible for distinguishing clear and turbid urine and stool; if it does not return to its area, it cannot control urination, resulting in involuntary urination. Generally, in warm weather, wearing thicker clothes leads to more sweating, whereas in cold weather, wearing lighter clothes leads to more urination. Increased urination is due to cold. For those who cannot control it, and if there is severe deficiency and cold, only the Eight-Flavored Pill will be effective. Ancient formulas such as the Cuscuta Seed Pill, Deer Antler Pill, and the Two-Qi Elixir can all be selected for use.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

With no restrictions on urination, it is advisable to use Great Dodder Seed Pill and to brew the crushed pig bladder in soup. All cases of bedwetting are attributed to deficiency. Liu Hejian states that excessive heat affects the kidney area and obstructs the liver&#39;s pathways, leading to severe stagnation where Qi and blood cannot flow, resulting in weakness and lack of response. Therefore, fluids leak into the bladder, causing involuntary urination and inability to control it. According to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the loss of urination due to excessive yin energy is a heat condition that should not be overlooked. Examining the &quot;Xue An,&quot; it is noted that fatigue can cause heat leading to thirst and spontaneous urination, sometimes with persistence. This may also stem from liver fire and blood deficiency, with the yin failing to constrain. In the morning, supplement with the Middle-Qi Benefiting Decoction adding yam and cornel; in the afternoon, take Six Flavors Pill, and after a month, the condition should improve.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Urinary Retention</strong></p>
<p>If small water does not flow, it is called urinary retention, which is the most dangerous and urgent symptom. When the water pathway is obstructed, it invades and causes bloating in the spleen and stomach, leads to swelling in the muscles, results in vomiting when it affects the central region, and causes wheezing if it attacks the upper region. If it remains obstructed for several days, it can lead to urgent distress and must result in a critical condition. Nowadays, people encounter this symptom and only know to promote urination, or use methods like sealing the navel with a snail, without distinguishing the underlying causes, which explains why many remain untreated.</p>
<p>In general, the causes of urinary retention fall into four categories, and it is essential to differentiate between deficiency and excess. If an obstruction in the small intestine and bladder is caused by fire pathogens, it is because the water source has dried up, and the gas orifices are hot and blocked. If heat settles in the liver and kidneys, it may lead to either depletion of essence or blood stagnation, blocking the water pathways. In such cases, there is in fact water present, but it is just obstructed; the excess can be cleared or promoted, and treatment options can be employed to facilitate this, which are lighter forms of urinary retention.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to qi obstruction, the condition is particularly critical. There are two meanings to qi obstruction: one is due to excessive qi leading to blockage, and the other is due to deficient qi causing the blockage.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The bladder serves as the organ that stores water, and the entry of water is transformed by qi; thus, where there is qi, there is water. The expulsion of water relies on water reaching qi; hence, when there is water, there is urination. The classics state: &quot;Qi transformation allows for expulsion.&quot; This implies that there must be transformation for entry before there can be transformation for exit; without transformation for entry, there can be no transformation for exit. Therefore, both entry and exit are dependent on qi transformation. This is the essence of qi transformation as stated in the classics, not merely discussing qi transformation in relation to exit alone. </p>
<p>Thus, within water there is qi, and qi is water; within qi there is water, and water is qi. Now, whenever there is a disease characterized by deficient qi and obstruction, it is invariably due to the depletion of true yang, the root of the primordial sea is absent, water and fire do not interact, and yin and yang are separated. As a result, qi fails to transform into water, and water remains stagnant. When qi does not transform water, then the water organ becomes exhausted; when water is stagnant, it can lead to seepage and decay. If qi cannot transform but attempts to forcibly promote flow, will that truly work? In instances where there is no yang in yin, and one uses harsh cold medicines, what can that achieve? The principle is quite clear. </p>
<p>As for qi being full yet obstructed, it is simply due to a strong liver causing qi to rebel, which obstructs the bladder, either breaking the qi or relieving the stagnation, or raising what has fallen – thus, any obstructions will naturally resolve. Treatment for fullness is not difficult, but treatment for emptiness must achieve transformation, which is not easy. Therefore, whenever faced with this pattern, one must not overlook a detailed differentiation between fullness and emptiness.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is fire in the lower burner and the bladder is hot, closed, and obstructed, there will certainly be indications of fire and hot channels, along with symptoms such as pain in the urinary tract. It is advisable to use remedies like Da Fen Qing Yin, Chou Xin Yin, Yi Yuan San, Yu Quan San, and Lu Dou Yin to facilitate drainage. If the real fire of the liver and kidneys is not cleared, or if there is turbidity or blood seen, generally clearing away the fire will ensure that the water flows freely; all previous methods can be applied. </p>
<p>In cases of Qi stagnation, treatment should distinguish between deficiency and excess, cold and heat. For instances of Qi excess, Qi is blocked between the small intestine and bladder, leading to obstruction, often due to the liver&#39;s strong Qi rebelling. Those who are prone to sudden anger and emotional restraint often exhibit this. It is advisable to focus on breaking Qi and promoting blood flow with herbs such as Xiang Fu, Zhi Ke, Wu Yao, Chen Xiang, and Hui Xiang, in conjunction with Si Ling San. If Qi is trapped below and the medicinal properties cannot immediately reach it, one should take these remedies in abundance and induce vomiting to raise the Qi, allowing the fluid to descend. </p>
<p>For phlegm and Qi stagnation which is obstructed and not flowing, use formulations like Er Chen Tang and Liu An Jian to induce vomiting. For heat obstructing and Qi rebelling, apply Da Fen Qing Yin to induce vomiting.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is excess Qi and deficiency of blood leading to obstruction, use the Siwu Decoction to induce vomiting. In cases of excess Qi and similar symptoms, nothing is more effective than inducing vomiting. It is like a container for dripping water; if the upper opening is closed, the lower opening cannot function. If the upper opening is opened, the lower opening will surely flow freely. This is the natural principle of rise and fall. </p>
<p>In cases where there is deficiency of Qi and difficulty urinating, it must be due to excessive loss of the foundational essence, or from aging and depletion of energy, leading to this condition. This is primarily because Qi is not being transformed, which is a critical situation. However, those suffering from this condition will experience gradual changes, noticing only a slight decrease in urination or difficulty during urination, so timely attention and treatment are essential. Waiting until it becomes severe may result in missed opportunities for intervention. </p>
<p>When treating this condition, it is also important to distinguish between the cold and heat of the organ&#39;s Qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some may doubt the use of cassia for its warm properties, fearing to use it lightly. How could they know that the yang energy of the lower source is greatly depleted? When exposed to cold, it condenses; when exposed to heat, it flows. Apart from these two elements, what else can directly reach the bladder and allow water to transform due to qi? If qi is deficient and descending improperly, one should use a tonic like &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; to address it, or this decoction might also be the best choice to induce vomiting. If one has a constitution with weak yang organs, internal heat unbearable to warming tonics, leading to urinary obstruction, it surely indicates a depletion of true yin; without yin, there can be no transformation of yang, resulting in water deficiency symptoms. Treatment should focus on nourishing yin and suppressing yang, primarily using medicinals like &quot;Huaye Decoction.&quot; If there is excessive yang but water cannot control fire, &quot;Zishen Pill&quot; from Dongyuan may also be appropriate, but it belongs to the category of fire symptoms.

<p>Long-term consumption of cassia or similar herbs can lead to water depletion and excessive yang, causing urinary retention; thus, a detoxifying and water-nourishing approach is necessary, using methods like &quot;Huaye Decoction.&quot; In severe cases, &quot;Huanglian Jiedu Decoction&quot; with added herbs for tonifying yin may be feasible. The &quot;Ludou Drink&quot; is a miraculous remedy for detoxification.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To address the deficiency of water, one must greatly nourish the true yin; if there is a deficiency of fire, one must vigorously replenish yang energy. When the qi reaches the water element, it will naturally adjust itself. One should not simply focus on superficial imbalances and recklessly remove blockages, as this is akin to squeezing out juice and draining oil. It will only lead to further depletion, which is dangerous.</p>
<p>In cases where there is no water in the bladder, symptoms can arise from diarrhea causing water to return to the large intestine, resulting in difficulty with urination. This should be treated by addressing the diarrhea; when the diarrhea stops, the water will flow naturally. If a person experiences profuse sweating, resulting in difficulty with urination due to qi being lost through sweat, the treatment should involve regulating the nutritive and defensive qi, allowing urination to improve naturally.</p>
<p>In cases of deficiency due to excessive labor and blood loss, where water is lost and the internal organs become dried out, leading to difficulty with urination, one must tonify the true yin. As blood and qi gradually replenish, urination will improve.</p>
<p>All of these scenarios reflect the condition of a dehydrated bladder and should not involve further reduction of fluids. Only in the case of diarrhea is there a potential for reducing fluids, and that is typically limited to a third of the time. These conditions do not indicate a blockage due to water not flowing; treatment should be sought from their respective paths.</p>
<p>For pregnant women, if there is a difficulty with urination, it is often due to the pressure of the fetus pushing down, which compresses the urethra, typically because of qi deficiency that cannot lift the fetus.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Incontinence due to Loss</h3>
<p>Inanimate loss can happen in various ways: some individuals may experience it due to self-inflicted causes while sleeping; others may be unable to prevent it due to weakness in the qi gate, leading to frequent occurrences; and there are those who may experience qi escaping upwards, resulting in a lack of control over the lower part of the body, where loss occurs unnoticed—this is a sign of extreme deficiency. </p>
<p>In summary, all three cases are associated with deficiency, but there is a distinction between severity. If someone loses control in their dreams, it is mostly found in the young, and as their qi strengthens and consolidates, or with some appropriate adjustments, they can recover without doubt. However, if one cannot hold urine due to a continuous flow of water and weakened bladder, it is certainly due to deficiency of qi. Qi is the root of water; without sufficient qi, water cannot be retained, and only with qi can one hold it. This indicates a major issue of losing control, which is greatly undesirable. Particularly concerning is when qi escapes, leading to incontinence without awareness—it is much more critical. </p>
<p>This is usually not related to wind conditions or individuals in old age with weakened qi, or often following severe illness. As Zhang Zhongjing stated: when the lower jiao is depleted, it leads to incontinence. This is what he meant. </p>
<p>In ancient texts discussing urinary incontinence, there is a distinction between hot and weak conditions. It is misunderstood that incontinence is due to excessive urination, often indicating deficiency and coldness, not heat. When heat causes frequent urination, the symptoms may include profuse dribbling and inability to hold it, with possibly painful urination—these indicate heat conditions, which must be treated differently, not as loss of control. Should one mistakenly identify deficiency and cold as heat and recklessly administer purging medications, it would lead to severe consequences. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In addressing the issue of frequent urination, traditional methods often rely on solidifying remedies, which is indeed appropriate. However, these remedies merely secure the openings and represent a symptomatic treatment rather than addressing the root cause. Although urination is linked to the kidneys, the kidneys are associated with the lungs; if lung qi is inadequate, the kidney water cannot be contained. Therefore, to manage water, one must also manage qi; to treat the kidneys, one must address the lungs. </p>
<p>It is advisable to primarily use ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, cinnamon, prepared aconite, and dried ginger, and then appropriately add solidifying remedies. This approach may address the underlying cause and ensure continuous flow. Otherwise, it is merely a temporary fix without lasting benefit. I have formulated the Gongdi Pill for treatment, suitable for heart, spleen, lung, and kidney conditions, and it should be used as a primary remedy.</p>
<p>In cases of spleen and lung qi deficiency, where the water pathways cannot be restricted, resulting in frequent urination, the issue lies within the upper and middle jiao. It is advisable to use formulas like Zhongy益气 Decoction, Lizhong Decoction, Wengwei Drink, Gui Spleen Decoction, or similar, adding solidifying remedies as the main treatment; if there is no improvement, one should then focus on the kidneys.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Instructions of the Stone Chamber</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Dry Constipation</strong> </p>
<p>When dryness becomes severe and fire is intense, the yin of the large intestine is depleted, leading to feces resembling sheep droppings, known as intestinal obstruction, an untreatable condition. However, if the yin is depleted, death should follow. Currently, not dead but suffering from intestinal obstruction indicates that the yin is not yet completely exhausted. As long as true yin remains, one cannot die, and as long as there is a thread of life, there is potential for recovery. I have a unique formula that specifically nourishes the yin, allowing the yin to regenerate and the fire to subside; when the yin is abundant, the intestines will be relaxed. The formula to use is the “Yin Nourishing Opening Obstruction Decoction”: 2 liang of cooked rehmannia, 1 liang each of ophiopogon and angelica, 5 qian each of raw rehmannia, achyranthes, lily bulb, cornelian cherry, and processing with mild liquor, and 3 qian of Chinese yam, all decocted in water for consumption. After taking several doses, the intestinal obstruction can be relieved, and feces will no longer resemble sheep droppings, allowing hope for regeneration. However, it is essential to take one dose daily for three months, then switch to the “Six Flavor Rehmannia Decoction,” or instead of a decoction, use pills to adjust for over a year, thereby ensuring that there will be no more suffering from colon problems.</p>
<p>As for those considering the cause of constipation to be excessive dryness of the large intestine, who knows it could be dryness of the lung qi? If the lungs are dry, the clearing and descending qi cannot flow down into the large intestine, and the water from the kidney channel is only enough to take care of itself; how could it flow out to moisten the streams? The formula to use consists of 3 liang each of cooked rehmannia and ophiopogon, 1 qian of hemp seed, and 2 qian of siler; boil with 1 bowl of cow&#39;s milk and 2 zhongs of water until reduced to six parts, then combine with the cow&#39;s milk and take 1 bowl. If one dose does not resolve the issue, the second dose will surely lead to a bowel movement.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The essence of this formula lies in nourishing the kidney without moistening the large intestine; even more remarkably, it not only nourishes the kidney but also the lung; and even more so, it not only nourishes the lung but also raises the lung. The large intestine is located in the lower part of the body and is most difficult to treat on its own; it must be moistened from the kidney channel and cleared from the lung channel. When the qi flows downwards and settles at the bottom, without using methods to elevate and raise, water will become blocked and stagnant. By opening the upper orifice, the lower orifice will naturally flow; this is a method of treating lower ailments by addressing upper issues, and it is also a method of treating organ ailments through channel organs. The remaining methods for treating organ ailments can be understood from this.</p>
<p>After a long illness, or if there is no bowel movement for a month, there is no need for haste; simply nourish the true yin, allowing the essence to be sufficient to generate blood, and the blood to be sufficient to moisten the intestines, thereby allowing bowel movements to occur naturally. The formula consists of 1 ounce each of cooked rehmannia, gardenia, and angelica, 5 qian of chuanxiong, 2 qian of hemp seed, half an ou of honey, 1 qian of rhubarb, 10 peach kernels, and 3 fen of safflower, which is decocted in water for consumption. This formula&#39;s brilliance lies in using cooked rehmannia, gardenia, and angelica to generate yin blood, with a slight addition of hemp seed and rhubarb to moisten the intestines for flow downwards. This method, while addressing obstruction, does not urgently seek to relieve it.</p>
<p>For constipation, there are also many cases of excess conditions. This formula has remarkable efficacy in treating excess conditions. It includes 5 qian of rhubarb, 1 ounce of the tail of angelica, 5 fen of ligusticum wallichii, half an ou of honey, decocted in water for consumption. Rhubarb purges and drains, while angelica moistens, still serving as the monarch herb. Although it purges, it is not excessively forceful, thus avoiding the detrimental loss of yin. Furthermore, with ligusticum wallichii to elevate it, there is both drainage and retention, so why worry excessively!<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Urination Difficulty</p>
<p>In cases of prolonged illness where urination is scanty or obstructed, it indicates that the kidney energy is unable to flow into the bladder. By tonifying the kidney energy, urination will naturally resume. The formula includes one ounce of cooked rehmannia, four qian of cornelian cherry, two qian of poria, and one qian each of plantain seeds, alisma, cinnamon, peony, and Chinese yam, all boiled in water to take as a decoction. The special aspect of this formula is that it does not attempt to unblock urination directly but focuses specifically on kidney water and kidney fire. If there is fire in the kidneys, the Qi transformation in the bladder will facilitate urination; thus, if urination is not flowing, it will eventually flow.</p>
<p>When urination is blocked, it is due to the Qi transformation in the bladder not functioning. The treatment should focus on the bladder meridian alone; however, the method does not solely concern treating the bladder. The formula includes three qian each of ginseng, lotus seeds, poria, plantain seeds, and shepherd&#39;s purse, twenty ginkgo nuts, one qian of licorice, and three fen of cinnamon, all boiled in water to take as a decoction. This is effective immediately. The uniqueness of this formula lies primarily in the use of ginseng, followed by the three fen of cinnamon, as the bladder must receive the Qi transformation to begin urination. What is the Qi transformation? It is the energy of the pericardium. The bladder must receive the downward flowing energy of the pericardium before the water can emerge. Particularly noteworthy is the use of twenty ginkgo nuts, which many are unaware of.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ginkgo nut connects all the channels, running through the governor and the constructive vessels. It flows towards the bladder, channeling the energy of ginseng and cinnamon directly into the bladder. Herbs like plantago and shepherd&#39;s purse serve to facilitate discharge, each leading to elimination from the orifice of the genitalia. This is the marvelous method for treating these organs.</p>
<p>In cases of dryness and severe obstruction, where the small intestine is too fine to allow for defecation and where the bloating is so severe that it feels life-threatening, these are conditions that cannot be treated merely as they are. What I wish to address is that the small intestine&#39;s opening and closing are managed by the kidneys. If one were to treat only the small intestine, it would become more vacuous, losing its role in transmission, leading to increased bloating. </p>
<p>Therefore, I will not treat the small intestine directly but instead focus on the kidneys. By opening the kidney qi, the small intestine will also open. The formula I propose is called &quot;Basic Treatment for Water Retention Decoction&quot;: two ounces of cooked rehmannia, one ounce each of cornelian cherry and ophiopogon, five qian each of plantago and poria, two qian of five-flavor fruit, and three qian each of achyranthes and euphorbia. Boil in water and take as a decoction. </p>
<p>With one dose, there may be slight relief; with a second dose, the intestines will relax, and urination will flow like a stream. This formula uses cooked rehmannia and cornelian cherry to tonify the kidneys, ophiopogon and five-flavor fruit to nourish lung qi, thereby promoting the downward flow of clear and purifying energy to the bladder; poria and plantago help disperse water accumulation; achyranthes and euphorbia utilize their swift properties to guide the downward flow without causing obstruction above. This is how the kidney qi facilitates water movement smoothly.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

<p>For obstruction causing difficulty urinating: Insert a single fish into the stalk. Alternatively, use half a jin of strong liquor with three qian of salt, mold it into a finger-sized piece, and deeply insert it into the lower region for effectiveness. Another method is to mix honey with swallow droppings and insert into the larger opening to facilitate urination. Another method involves half a he of salt and three he of honey, boil until syrupy, form into pills the size of areca nuts and deeply insert into the lower region for immediate relief. To treat constipation, one may use only fermented soy sauce, clear soy sauce, sheep cheese, or juice from earth gourd roots as an enema for prompt results.

Inflate the bladder to seven parts full, secure it, and then pinch the end of the feather tube, remove the yellow wax, and place the tube at the urine opening, releasing the end of the tube.

<p><strong>Gate of Urination and Defecation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture and Moxibustion</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Needling the area three inches below the inner thigh leads to involuntary urination. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: The Sanjiao (Three Burners) is where the lesser yang and the greater yin of the foot converge; it is distinct from Taiyang (Greater Yang). Five inches above the ankle, it separates into the intestines, exits at Weiyang, and enters the bladder, connecting to the lower jiao. If it is full, it causes urinary retention; if it is deficient, it results in involuntary urination. For involuntary urination, tonify; for urinary retention, drain.</p>
<p>When Qi collapses and affects the throat, causing inability to speak, with clear hands and feet, and difficult defecation, one should target the foot&#39;s lesser yin. When there is absence of Qi but the abdomen feels heavy, with internal coldness and difficulty in urination and defecation, target the foot&#39;s greater yin.</p>
<p>The channel of the hand&#39;s greater yin, known as Lieque, begins at the wrist and travels along the greater yin channel, directly entering the palm, dispersing into the area between the fingers. In cases of excess, there is sharp pain and heat in the palm; in deficiency, there is frequent involuntary urination. Needle half an inch from the wrist to follow the pathway of Yangming (Greater Yang).<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The foot Shaoyin channel is known as the Great Clock. It winds around the heel behind the ankle and branches off to the Taiyang; its branches run above, traveling under the Heart Protector, and outward connect to the spine. When there is rebellious qi, it causes irritation; when full, it leads to urinary retention, while in deficiency, it results in low back pain. The points to be used are at the branches.</p>
<p>For lower abdominal pain and swelling with difficulty urinating, if the obstruction is in the Sanjiao, use the Taiyang Great Luo point. Observe its connecting vessels and the blood with the Jueyin small vessels. If the swelling ascends to the stomach area, use the point at Sanli.</p>
<p>For urinary retention, use Yin Qiao and San Mao above, along with points for blood vessels that are bleeding.</p>
<p>For abnormal urination and defecation, treat the symptoms; if there is normal urination and defecation, treat the root cause. </p>
<p>If there’s first difficulty in urination and then other diseases arise, treat the root. </p>
<p>With insufficient central qi, urination and defecation are affected, and the intestines make uncomfortable sounds. Restore sufficient energy below the outer ankle and retain the treatment there.</p>
<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states that in cases of Sanjiao diseases, the abdomen is bloated and full of qi, especially the lower abdomen is hard, with difficulty in urination and urgency; if there is overflow, it leads to water retention, and if retained, it leads to bloating. The point to observe is outside the foot Taiyang&#39;s Great Luo, located between Taiyang and Shaoyang, and can also be felt in the pulse; use the Weizhong point.</p>
<p>If the lower abdomen is full and painful, it ascends to the chest reaching the heart, causing a feeling of discomfort and oscillation, accompanied by fluctuating cold and heat, and difficulty in urination; use the foot Jueyin point.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secret Essentials of Preserving Life&quot; states: For the method of guiding when bowel movements are not smooth, press the tongue against the roof of the mouth, maintaining calmness and silence while the fluid is generated on its own. Wait for the mouth to fill with a red dragon stirring, frequently cough and swallow, and listen as it descends directly to the elixir field. Then maintain stillness and swallow several times, and the large intestine will naturally moisten, enabling the subsequent workings to be effective.</p>
<p>For the practice of moving energy: with the left hand on the navel, direct intentions to rotate and open the five organs backward, allowing the pathway of the large intestine to run smoothly; or raise the kidney water to wash and moisten the large intestine and promote expulsion. Cover the navel with the hand, again push the five organs backward to clear the pathway of the large intestine; or raise kidney water to cleanse and purge the large intestine.</p>
<p>For the guiding method of the tailbone’s energy descent: clench your teeth, hold your breath, raise your shoulders, open your eyes wide, and turn your head left and right while tightly clenching the buttocks; by doing so, the energy will naturally rise. </p>
<p>The practice: The sign of the primordial energy sinking is when the expelled gas does not have a foul odor. Since holding the breath during practice prevents the energy from rising, one should adhere to the method of returning to the primordial source, completing a full circuit for seven days to see results.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When using effective techniques targeting the tailbone and the dual acupuncture points along the spine, if one cannot summon the energy and it falls away, it is advisable to employ quiet practices of introspection to naturally rise to the crown without attachment. The method for guiding the small water when it is stagnant involves rolling a small paper into a point and inserting it into the nose, waiting for a sneeze to clear the blockage. If stagnation persists, rub the palms and the Yongquan point, calming the fire and settling the spirit, or practice circulation techniques for effect.</p>
<p>The method of circulation and the small intestine condition can be treated in the same way, following the principle of returning to the source. Rotate and move downward, then reach the affected area, moving in this manner several dozen times, then spiral upward, dispersing and surrounding it continuously, repeating the process gradually, purifying the passage and maintaining calm.</p>
<p>For guide pressure on the urinary canal: press on the Kan point with a finger and perform circular motions twenty-four times, while mentally inhaling from above the spiritual center, rotating the energy around, returning to the source with each cycle, and then drawing it upward three times for breathing practice, combining the movement techniques for effect.</p>
<p>With regards to the movements: those affected by seated meditation should focus their thoughts on the sea of qi for a while, then silently rotate and circulate, moving yet still, constantly mindful, allowing the energy to consolidate. The method of returning to the source involves directing the intention upward, rotating and transforming the essence from left to right, first moving the navel wheel, collecting and releasing, releasing and then collecting, returning to the original state, never departing from this, and the thoughts naturally return to their true origin.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Confucian Door to Filial Piety&quot; states: A man named Dai visited his relatives in Cao Nan and found that his cousin was suffering from severe constipation. There were no other symptoms; he often dared not eat to fullness, as doing so would lead to extremely difficult bowel movements, with stools as hard as iron or stone. Sometimes, he would go three to five days without a bowel movement, and when it occurred, it was painfully difficult. Blood would come from his nose, and he experienced pain in the anus and rectum. The pain was so extreme that it would cause fainting. When he took medicine, his condition worsened. He had tried various harsh laxatives like croton seed, bitter herb, and euphorbia, but excessive use only led to exhaustion, and stopping the laxatives led to dryness returning, resulting in this suffering lasting for several years. Frightened of the violent effects of these medications, he merely lay in bed and awaited death.</p>
<p>When Dai arrived, he took the pulse of both hands and found it smooth, solid, and strong. He then administered a dose of the Big Cold Purging Decoction, followed by the Divine Efficacy Pill and Hemp Seed Pill. He instructed him to eat dishes made from soft vegetables and pig or beef blood, and after over a hundred days, his weight increased significantly, shocking his relatives.</p>
<p>Alas! Inexperienced practitioners fail to recognize that dryness can be categorized into four types: external dryness manifests as wrinkled skin, internal dryness leads to depletion of essence and blood, upper dryness causes dryness in the throat and nose, while lower dryness results in constipation and urination difficulties. The disease of dryness arises from the transformation of the yangming, due to a cold and scanty presence of fluid. Thus, purging is necessary, but the right medicine must be chosen. For instance, croton seed can purge cold, bitter herb and euphorbia can relieve dampness, and rhubarb along with saline can purge dryness. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;Use warmth to moisten,&quot; and &quot;Use salty to soften.&quot; The &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; mentions: &quot;Use slippery substances to nourish the orifices.&quot;<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a></p></div>

Each time he felt the urge, he found his spirit dimming, his head spinning, his nose blocked, and his waist in pain. Gradually, his condition worsened, and although he could eat, his stool became hard and dry like a pellet.

He began to eat this daily, and soon he experienced relief both before and after eating. His spirit brightened with the food, and he lived to ninety years old, passing away without illness. The &#39;Illustrated Treatise&#39; states: Spinach is cold and beneficial for the intestines and stomach. Sesame oil, when stir-fried and consumed, facilitates bowel movements.

Day and night he could not sleep, unable to eat, suffering indescribable pain, and he sought my treatment. I inquired about the onset of his illness; he mentioned he felt no thirst and had bouts of severe vomiting. Various doctors all prescribed treatments for abdominal fullness and diuretics. Faced with an urgent situation, I returned home, and through the night until dawn, I was restless, pondering the matter deeply. Suddenly I recalled the &quot;Suwen&quot; stating: &quot;Without Yang, Yin cannot thrive; without Yin, Yang cannot transform.&quot; It also states: &quot;The bladder is the official responsible for the regions, where fluids are stored, able to expel when qi transforms.&quot; This illness of urinary retention is due to the absence of Yin, preventing the transformation of Yang energy. All diuretic medicines are light and infiltrating, representing Yang. They merely promote qi, being Yin within Yang, but not transforming from the cold Yin of northern water.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is due to excessive nourishment, with rich foods accumulating heat, damaging the Northern yin, resulting in insufficient kidney water. Consequently, the bladder and kidney chambers become dry over time, and urination is not transformed, with fire rising to cause vomiting, which is not a condition caused by obstruction above. It is specifically related to the &quot;guan&quot; (barrier), not a disease of obstruction. The ancient elder Jie Gu stated: with heat in the lower jiao, it fills and obstructs. This is the method for treating obstructive conditions. The patient presents with both internal and external obstructive diseases, facing imminent death, yet treating the lower jiao may lead to recovery. One should adapt to the transformation of cold water from the North, using bitter cold herbs that are entirely yin, such as Huanglian, Zhimu, and Gui, formulated into pills the size of tung seeds. Boil them in water and take two hundred pills; shortly after taking the medicine, the anterior yin will feel as if stabbed by a knife and burned with pain, the urination will gush out like a waterfall, soaking the bedding, forming streams beneath the bed, and swelling will dissipate upon careful observation. I expressed my surprise, saying: &quot;Great are the words of the sage! How could one not thoroughly examine them and cling to but one!&quot; The evidence shows that when urination is obstructed but there is no thirst, and there are signs of agitation, this is it. Generally, all illnesses in the lower jiao do not present with thirst. The two types of illness, concerning qi and blood, are easiest to differentiate.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: Yang Chun had severe constipation, with urination normal, the throat obstructed, and phlegm appearing after eating. The pulse was thin, and both hands were the same. This is a severe case of spleen qi deficiency leading to dry intestines, for which Ren Shen San is the main treatment.</p>
<p>A woman experienced abdominal pain and later suffered from obstructed urination and defecation. This is phlegm blocking the middle jiao, with qi stagnation in the lower jiao.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Lu Zhongnian was sixty-six years old when he fell ill with a cold and fever. After the heat subsided, his pulse remained strong and rapid. This rapid pulse was analyzed as weak, and he was given a mixture of ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, roasted licorice, angelica, peony, and dried citrus peel for several days, but his pulse remained large and did not settle down. Additionally, he had difficulty urinating and experienced a distended sensation in his lower abdomen, which greatly troubled him; he could only manage to urinate by lying on his back. I said that the nourishing medicine had not yet reached him. I then doubled the dose of astragalus and ginseng, and after two days, his urination improved.</p>
<p>A man presented with urinary obstruction, and the doctor prescribed diuretics, which worsened his condition. Danxi said: This is due to accumulated phlegm. The phlegm accumulates in the lungs, which is the upper jiao, while the bladder is the lower jiao. When the upper jiao is obstructed, the lower jiao is also blocked. This is like a dripping water vessel; both the upper and lower openings must be clear for the water to flow out. Therefore, he used a method of inducing vomiting to expel it. After vomiting, the illness seemed to be alleviated. This shows that urinary retention is not solely governed by the channels&#39; diseases.</p>
<p>Ma Xisheng, over fifty years old, had a fondness for alcohol and frequently drank heavily. The sediment would exit through the mouth, while urination occurred through the lower orifice. His six pulses were deep and sluggish. He was treated with the Four Substances Decoction, enhanced with peppermint, areca nut, peach kernel, and akebia, and he recovered. This man had excess alcohol, which harmed his vital energy; the alcohol ascended without descending, leaving his yang extremely deficient. Long-term alcohol consumption accumulated moisture and generated heat, depleting the blood and also exhausting the yin. Both yin and yang being deficient can be replenished. This man, since his middle age, could still survive when both yin and yang were temporarily weak, due to his robust build and the vitality still present in the alcohol he consumed. However, after three months, he was bound to die. Eventually, this indeed happened.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A person aged forty is experiencing dry mouth and frequent urination. At the end of spring, a remedy was sought in the summer; pulse readings indicate dryness, the right pulse is slightly rapid but not wiry, strong yet somewhat forceful, while the left is slightly heavy, a bit weak, and not strong. However, the dryness in the left pulse is more pronounced than in the right. There is a preference for warming rich foods; this is referred to as phlegm-heat. The patient should avoid rich flavors, reduce fire to clear the metal element, suppress the liver and nourish the spleen, taking twenty-one pills of the Three Supplements, five pills of Yuanming powder, five pills of Ejiao, swallowed with ginger soup, six times a day. Additionally, a decoction of the Four Substance Soup with added ginseng, astragalus, dried tangerine peel, sweet licorice, five-flavor fruit, and ophiopogon should be taken three times a day, alternating with the pills. In one or two days, the patient feels clearer, urination decreases by two-thirds, mouth dryness diminishes, thirst remains unresolved, and there is dizziness and eye strain; prolonged sitting results in lower back pain. Consequently, they used Yao Yao Dan to treat the back pain and continued with the Four Substance Soup, reducing Chuanxiong, adding ginseng, astragalus, white atractylodes, achyranthes, five-flavor fruit, roasted rhubarb, and ophiopogon, boiling to prepare Liu Yi San. They then noticed increased urination, which led to discontinuing Liu Yi San while continuing with the pills.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman experiences a blockage in urination with a pulse that is thin and weak; when re-examined, it feels string-like. The left side is slightly harmonious. This condition arises from worry and strain. The thinness indicates a deficiency of blood and an excess of qi; a lack of blood causes the womb to sag, while an excess of qi leads to fluid stagnation. When the middle burner is not clear and overflows, the womb senses the need to retreat and thus descends. </p>
<p>To treat this, use the Si Wu Decoction with additions of ginseng, atractylodes, banxia, dried tangerine peel, licorice, and ginger. Administer it on an empty stomach, and concurrently induce vomiting through finger exploration.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>An old man suffered from difficulty urinating. He had taken diuretic medicine excessively, which led to obstruction, resulting in a drip of urine. I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to address his sinking stomach qi, and after one dose, he was able to urinate. Because he had previously overused diuretics, his kidney qi was depleted, leading to post-urination dribbling that lasted all night. I urgently needed to tonify his kidneys, and then he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Handbook of Health&quot; states: The Right Assistant of the Zhongshu Department suffered from frequent and insufficient urination, with over twenty occurrences day and night, accompanied by abdominal distension and heaviness in the lower back and limbs, preventing him from resting comfortably. In the late spring of the Yuan Gui Wei year, I was ordered by the Emperor to treat him and went to diagnose him. His pulse was deep and slow, sometimes showing a few beats. I noted that there are three types of patients with poor urine output, which cannot be generalized. The first situation is when fluid mainly seeps into the intestines and stomach, leading to diarrhea while urine is scant; this can be resolved with diuretics. The second is when heat affects the lower jiao, causing fluids to become hot and stagnant, preventing them from flowing; in this case, drainage would be beneficial. The third is when the spleen and stomach qi is stagnant and failing to open the water passage, thus not transmitting to the bladder for transformation; this can be rectified by smoothing the qi to facilitate movement. The Right Assistant, accustomed to rich foods, accumulated dampness and heat internally, which hindered transformation, resulting in obstruction of the bladder, hence the frequent yet deficient urination. Unless there is drainage, he cannot achieve relief.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, it is prepared as a formula named Fu Ling Hu Po Decoction. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: sweet, gentle, and mildly permeating. When heat obstructs the body’s fluids, causing abdominal distention and fullness, it must be eased. This easing must primarily rely on sweetness and mildness. Therefore, Fu Ling is used as the chief ingredient. Hua Shi is sweet, cold, and smooth, facilitating the orifices, while Zhu Ling and Hu Po are mild and help to drain and benefit the water pathways, hence these three are used as assistants. The spleen is averse to dampness; when dampness accumulates, the spleen&#39;s function cannot be restored. To augment the spleen and combat dampness, sweetness must assist; thus, Gan Cao and Bai Zhu are employed as deputies. Salty flavors enter the kidneys; the salty taste promotes drainage, and Ze Xie’s saltiness helps drain the stagnant water. The kidneys are also adverse to dryness;辛 (spicy) flavors must be consumed quickly to moisten them. When body fluids do not flow, spicy substances can disperse them. Gui Zhi is spicy and disperses dampness while moistening dryness, which is the rationale for their use; hence these two are used as messengers. Decoct long and with sweet and soft water to avoid aiding kidney energy. Prepare a significant quantity of the decoction, allowing it to reach below and act swiftly. Reduce the dosage to half for two administrations, and within ten days, significant improvement will be observed.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a></p></div>

She summoned me for diagnosis and treatment. All six pulse readings were deep and bound, indicating blood deficiency. I prescribed a modified Shiquan Dabu Tang with added peach kernel, sesame seed, and roasted rhubarb. After several doses, there was no relief, but the fullness and discomfort increased. I then gave her Dongyuan&#39;s Zhi Shi Dao Zhi Wan and emergency Da Huang Wan, but after taking the medicine, she promptly vomited it out; her stomach&#39;s energy was weak and could not retain quick-acting medicines. Therefore, I wrapped the emergency Da Huang Wan in yellow wax and pierced it with a fine needle, instructing her to take three pills. The wax coating prevented it from aggravating her stomach energy, allowing it to pass through the pylorus and reach the small intestine to take effect. The next day, she expelled about a liter of hardened stool. Subsequently, I adjusted the Shiquan Dabu Tang to make a decoction to help her swallow the laxative pills. After a month of such adjustments, her bowel movements returned to normal, her appetite improved, and she regained stability.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man in his fifties, due to anger, ate little and had difficulty with bowel movements. After taking a laxative pill, he experienced constipation, chest and side pain, and wished to also take a pill for strengthening the spleen. His pulse was floating and thin in the liver, spleen, and kidney. I said: This indicates a deficiency of the three yin&#39;s essence and blood. Doctor Dongyuan said: If a person has a strong stomach but a weak spleen, it restricts the bodily fluids. When they cannot be distributed throughout but instead are directed to the bladder, resulting in frequent urination and difficulty with bowel movements, use the spleen-strengthening pill. If a person has dry yin blood with inner heat burning, the lung metal suffers from evil, and the earth is injured by wood affecting the spleen, causing the lungs to lose their transmission, then if there is constipation with frequent urination, use the laxative pill. Now, nourishing the source of transformation will naturally adjust the bowel movements. Follow this method, and it will be proven effective.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar, with feelings of depression and setbacks due to an unfinished task, developed a fever and thirst, and felt discomfort in his chest and diaphragm, along with decreased appetite. He took remedies to clear heat, transform phlegm, and move qi, but his prior symptoms worsened, and he felt fatigued with stagnation in the heart and spleen pulses. This indicated a change due to spleen damage from depression. Therefore, he was given a modified Gui Pi Decoction, and gradually, his appetite improved and symptoms receded. However, his bowel movements remained sluggish, and his cheeks were flushed red, indicating deficient kidney and liver heat harming yin blood. He was treated with Ba Zhen Decoction plus epimedium, ophiopogon, and schisandra for more than thirty doses, and his bowel movements became normal.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a></p></div>

He sought a cure again. I observed him and said: both yin and yang channels are injured. When the yang channel is harmed, blood spills outside; when the yin channel is harmed, blood spills inside. He refused treatment, and later that was indeed the case.</p>
<p>Zheng Fang, aged over sixty, first experienced constipation and took internal purgatives. Later, he had little appetite, felt bloated in the chest and abdomen, experienced pain in both sides, felt fatigued, and his pulses were wide at the distal points and thin on the left side, while the right side was wiry. It was May when he sought treatment. I concluded that the fire at the gate was weak and could not nourish the spleen, while the lung metal was suppressing the liver wood, fearing he would not recover during this strong metal phase. Later, that was indeed the case.</p>
<p>Liu Tianxi had internal damp-heat, with stools being slippery and urine being difficult. After taking mild diuretics, the situation worsened, causing swelling in the lower abdomen and knees, and his eyes felt swollen and painful. This indicated kidney deficiency with heat in the lower jiao; taking mild diuretics harmed the yang energy, leading to no transformation of the yin. Thus, I prescribed Rehmannia and the Two Kidney Pills, but urination remained the same; I then added Bu Zhong Yi Qi and combined it with Wheat and Five Flavors for him to recover.</p>
<p>A wealthy merchant neglected proper diet and daily routine, resulting in dry and firm stools, and often took intestinal lubricants. Later, he experienced chest and abdominal discomfort, lacked appetite, had a dry mouth, felt fatigued, and had fever with phlegm. After taking herbs like Er Chen and Huang Lian, his previous symptoms intensified, with dripping urination, diarrhea, bloating, and reduced appetite. Taking Wu Ling and Qu Mai led to urinary obstruction, body swelling, shortness of breath, and cough. I then used Jin Kui Shen Qi Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for his recovery.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a></p></div>

<p>Minister Bian Huaquan frequently urinated, and his urine was scant, red, and painful, accompanied by dry mouth and phlegm.

<p>A Confucian scholar often experienced fevers, drank water continuously, and suffered painful and difficult urination accompanied by painful bowel movements. This was due to exhaustion of essence.

<p>Liu Dacans, over sixty years of age, appeared weak and fragile, with frequent or involuntary urination, internal heat, dry mouth, and occasional coughs and wheezing. I suspected a deficiency in lung and kidney qi, so I prescribed the Six-Flavor Pills and Benefiting Qi Decoction to nourish the source of his condition.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Standard for Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: In the autumn of the Jiawu year, I treated a woman aged fifty who initially suffered from frequent urination. The physician prescribed Ba Zheng San and similar remedies, but her urination did not improve, and she felt as if she was being pierced by thorns. I attributed it to dampness caused by excessive rain, believing that the pathogen remained on the surface. Therefore, I used Cang Zhu as the main ingredient and Fu Zi as an assistant to release it from the surface. After one dose, she sweated and her urination immediately became smooth.</p>
<p>Ma Shen Zheng&#39;s father, aged eighty, initially suffered from short and frequent urination. After taking medicinal herbs, he experienced excessive urination leading to a complete blockage, with not a single drop coming out. I deduced that excessive consumption had harmed his stomach energy, causing his lower body to become deficient. I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and after one dose, his urination returned. Since he had previously taken too many diuretics, it had harmed his kidney energy, which caused him to experience nocturnal incontinence after correction. I urgently supplemented his kidney energy, and then the situation improved. In all medical treatments, there has never been a case where diuretic agents are not used; how could one care for the deficiency of kidney energy?</p>
<p>For cases involving stagnant blood leading to urination difficulties, it is advisable to use a lot of Niu Xi. The &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot; recounts that recently in Piling, the wife of a high official experienced an inability to urinate and unbearable abdominal swelling and pain. Numerous physicians treated her for dysuria with remedies like Ba Zheng San, yet her condition did not improve and worsened. Upon examination, I diagnosed it as blood stagnation, and no gentle remedies could resolve it. I then used a decoction of Tao Ren, which initially caused great pain around noon; shortly after, several blood clots the size of fists were expelled, and her urine flowed like black bean juice in one to two sheng, relieving the pain. This medicine is potent and should be used cautiously for those with weak energy and blood.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Examination of Medical Prescriptions,&quot; it is stated: In the late Song dynasty, there was a physician named Xiong Yancheng, aged fifty-five, who suffered from an illness causing him difficulty with urination and bowel movements. For five days, his abdomen was swollen like a drum, and his peers looked on, all unable to provide help. He was close friends with the monk Huiyue from West Lake and sent a message inviting him for a final farewell. The monk hurriedly went, encountering a strange guest at Da Qiao, who greeted him, saying, &quot;Noble man from beyond the world, why do you hurry so?&quot; The monk replied, &quot;A good friend is suffering from a severe illness and is in critical condition; I wish to inquire about his health.&quot; The guest said, &quot;It&#39;s an easy matter. Allow me to prepare a medicine.&quot; He then took off his shoes and waded into the water, retrieving a large conch shell. He said, &quot;The matter is resolved.&quot; Upon returning home, he mixed half a spoon of salt with the conch shell, crushed it, and placed it an inch and three-fifths below the patient&#39;s navel, tightly binding it with a wide cloth, and also prepared a pot for urination to assist with his needs. The monk did not fully trust this approach and politely thanked him. When he arrived at Xiong&#39;s house, Yancheng was unconscious, and his wife and children were in tears. As other doctors had no other strategies, they cautiously tried this method. Without even taking a seat, the patient suddenly relieved himself. The doctors were ashamed and dispersed. The monk returned to inquire about the strange guest but could find no trace of him. Xiong lived for another sixteen years before passing away. The master stated that difficulty with urination and bowel movements is due to heat blockages. The conch shell has a cold nature and is good at dispersing and clarifying. In murky water, one touch of the conch can clear it. The salt is simply used for its moisture-retaining qualities.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;寓意草&quot; (Meaning of Herbs) states: Jiang Yiren obtained a strange testimony, referring to the explanation in the &quot;Shen Nong&#39;s Classic of Materia Medica&quot; regarding the treatment of intestinal disorders with the Wuling Decoction, deeming it mysterious. I observed this and clarified: the symptom of intestinal disorder involves both bowel movements, which can interchange as if they were trading. In ancient times, Wuling was used specifically to clear the front passage. If the symptoms are confined to the rear passage, with both bowel movements originating from the front, likening it to intestinal disorders indeed presents a chance of misunderstanding. Furthermore, intestinal disorders arise suddenly as a violent illness, causing chaotic qi within. This condition, in contrast, results from a chronic illness, where blood gradually depletes internally, showcasing a significant difference. How can they be compared?</p>
<p>The root of illness begins with worry and grief, which can damage the spleen. The spleen regulates blood, and if it is damaged, it cannot control the flow, leading to erratic discharges similar to excessive bleeding or loss of vitality. In such cases, great supplementation and stabilization are necessary. However, if this is mistakenly treated as excessive bleeding, using methods to cool the blood and clear fire, the outflow will only increase. One fails to consider that with the end of the Tide of Life, there is no illness present. When one is aged and qi is weak, the absence of sufficient blood to control leads to neglect.</p>
<p>As a result, the blood to the passages diminishes day by day, compelling the need to borrow resources from the large intestine, which in turn causes blood from the large intestine to seep into the reproductive organ. Over time, the blood from the large intestine also depletes, and its qi, which moves with the blood, becomes isolated and aimless, leading to chaos much like the calamities faced by the woods and waters.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, like those who save from disaster, they strip neighboring countries to establish a desolate place that they disregard. Yet it is still not enough. When the stomach area is nourished, the blood from the stomach area is drawn and seeps into the body’s cavities; after a long time, the blood of the stomach runs out, and the blood that is expelled has no source to stop it. The blood of the stomach is what nourishes the body and fills the meridians; now that it has become dark and returns to nothingness, the grass loses its moisture and the feet suffer worry. When the blood is exhausted and stops, it is far worse than when there is blood but it flows out. Thus, after the blood runs out, the qi becomes chaotic; when the qi is chaotic, the water and grains are neglected and therefore turn to new sources, neglecting spaciousness for narrowness. The channels of the Yangtze and Han rivers converge into one path, resulting in great chaos within the body. The large intestine must reopen its original pathway to restore order, and this has no relation to the prescription of Wuling. Furthermore, since the water and grains pass from the stomach to the intestines with a separate pylorus that distinguishes between the clear and the turbid, if due to the seepage of blood there arises a grain pathway, the pylorus becomes a smooth route. Is it still possible to reopen it with Wuling? Moreover, the affliction of Wuling is deeply cautioned against by those who worry about lost blood. Nowadays, seeing a single ailment, one often has a remedy obstructing the chest; as for those who uphold established prescriptions as spiritual secrets, most tend to mislead others. If one is to address someone’s ailment, I merely need to place three fingers lightly and then ask: “Are there frequent weeping episodes?” If a maid or elderly woman replies: “I weep often,” then it is known that dryness within the organs causes excessive weeping, and the large intestine is currently useless. What of the intestinal channels? Now, if the pulse of the large intestine is evident in the fingers, is it possible to predict when the spring jujube leaves will come? When the jujube leaves sprout, the fruits can be expected.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

However, the condition of dryness is not uniform; there is heat dryness, wind dryness, yang constipation, and yin constipation. Additionally, there are cases of elderly individuals with qi deficiency and insufficient fluids leading to dryness.

They seep down, refining and separating fluids, calling upon the lower energizer to flow into the bladder. Wang Bing explains that the water and fluids from the small intestine seep and enter the bladder, where they are transformed into urine and expelled. Yang Jie notes that the food and drink in the small intestine are received at the ileocecal junction for separation. The water then seeps into the bladder’s upper opening, resulting in urination. When reviewing these three explanations, it is clear that urination is simply the fluid that is refined and seeps into the bladder to be expelled. The \"Su Wen\" states: Water consumed in the stomach creates essence and energy, which ascends to the spleen; the spleen’s energy then disperses essence back to the lungs, regulating the water pathway to the bladder. Thus, urination appears to be the refined essence from water drinks, which rises to the spleen and lungs, undergoing transformation before becoming urine. These perspectives differ; upon what principle shall we rely? I say we rely on reasoning. Moreover, what exactly is urination? It is merely water. The nature of water is to flow downward. Therefore, when consumed, even though its essence and energy may rise, the original substance of the drink cannot ascend."},{"anchor":"trans-30p","marker":"30p","type":"translation","text":"If it cannot rise, how can it be said that urination is solely a product of vaporization? It is only because it cannot rise that it must rely on that which can rise to lead it, which is why it is also said: the bladder stores fluids; vaporization enables it to exit. Furthermore, water is the offspring of air, and air is the mother of water; when air moves, water moves; when air is stagnant, water is stagnant. Some say that urination purely results from secretion, not from transformation, but they do not understand this principle. Nevertheless, the bladder is indeed the reservoir for fluids; it has a membrane and contains fluids within. Hence it is also said: the membrane transfers heat to the bladder. The \"Spiritual Pivot\" states: the membrane of the bladder is thin and delicate. The \"Classified Compendium\" states: the bladder is the chamber of the membrane. Moreover, the membrane resides in the bladder, having an upper opening but no lower opening. When fluids accumulate within the membrane, they cannot escape on their own, but must be vaporized; only then can they gradually moisten outside the membrane, accumulate in the empty space below the membrane, and consequently form urine that exits through the front passage. What the \"Plain Questions\" indicates about the bladder storing fluids encompasses the bladder as well as the membrane. Should one say that there is no empty space below the membrane, then how can a person hurry to the toilet when the urge to urinate arises? It is only when the empty space below the membrane is filled to capacity that one cannot contain it any longer, leading to an urgent need to go to the toilet. To claim that the membrane has a lower opening but no upper opening, or that it has openings both above and below, or that it has small orifices that serve as drainage routes, is indeed absurd!"},{"anchor":"trans-31p","marker":"31p","type":"translation","text":"Danxi Heart Method by Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty) Dryness and Stagnation When dryness leads to stagnation and there is little blood, it cannot provide nourishment.

The large intestine is responsible for expelling waste rather than retaining it. Now, if accumulation occurs without diversion, why is this so? There must be a reason. If pathogens invade internally, the stomach becomes dry and constipated, and if the triple burner is beset by heat, the body fluids dry up; this is the heat retained in the large intestine. A person with deficiency has cold organs and depleted blood vessels, while an elderly person has cold organs and sluggish airways; this is the cold retained in the large intestine. There could also be cases of the intestines and stomach being affected by wind, leading to dryness and constipation due to wind influence. If the qi does not descend and the digestive pathway is obstructed, if there is counterflow and fullness in the chest, there must be a corresponding condition. On the discussion of the \"Spleen Constraint Pill\" Cheng Wuyi stated: The term \"constraint\" refers to both binding and restricting. When the stomach is strong but the spleen is weak, it limits the distribution of fluids, instead only passing them to the bladder, resulting in frequent urination and hard stools; hence it is called spleen constraint. This pill, by alleviating the dryness and constraint in the spleen, moistens the intestines and transforms bodily fluids into the stomach, thereby achieving great ease in bowel movements and reducing urination for healing. However, I have doubts. It has been said that if there is spleen constraint, the spleen's weakness prevents movement. A weak spleen signifies a deficiency of the earth element. This must be due to the dispersion of spleen qi and the depletion of spleen blood. Tracing its origin, it arises after prolonged illness, severe diarrhea, or excessive sweating, leading to the depletion of yin blood and the internal burning of fire, injuring the vital energy and also harming the spleen, thus creating this condition. When the vital energy is harmed, the lung metal element suffers from fire's attack, and qi can no longer be contained; when the spleen is harmed, since the lungs are considered the offspring of the spleen, the depletion of the lungs leads to the exhaustion of bodily fluids, inevitably stealing maternal qi for self-preservation. When metal is consumed, wood becomes scarce and vulnerable; thus, the earth element cannot avoid injury."},{"anchor":"trans-33p","marker":"33p","type":"translation","text":"When the spleen fails to transform and transport, and the lungs lose their function of conduction, it leads to constipation and difficulty in bowel movements, while urination becomes frequent and unable to retain fluids.

The spleen must be healthy and able to circulate fluids, as when fluids enter the stomach, the intestines become moist and passages are opened. Currently, using rhubarb as the main ingredient, along with bitter orange and magnolia bark as the assistants, although peony helps nourish the blood and sesame and apricot kernels provide warmth and moisture, if used in cases of significant heat and solid qi, nothing will be stable. I fear that for people from the northwest with abundant earth energy and robust constitution, they may be able to use this. However, for those in the southeast with internal heat and weak blood and qi, though temporary relief may be achieved, it will only lead to a weaker and drier spleen. Future users of this formula must understand that in the northwest, the focus should be on unblocking, whereas in the southeast, it should focus on moistening and relieving dryness. One must be careful not to be rigid in their approach. Regarding the prohibitions related to opening the bowels, I have observed that ancient formulas for relieving constipation all utilize downward-moving herbal preparations. This is because if lung qi does not descend, the bowels are reluctant to move, thus ingredients like apricot kernel, bitter orange, agarwood, and myrobalan are employed. Furthermore, for the elderly, the weak, or those with wind conditions who lack fluids and are constipated, herbs that provide lubrication are necessary, such as sesame, hemp seeds, and donkey-hide gelatin. If one rashly uses harsh purgative drugs to forcefully expel, the fluids will be depleted, and qi and blood will be consumed, leading to temporary relief but resulting in future constipation and the onset of other illnesses.

The \"Nan Jing\" states that the small intestine corresponds to the red intestine. Hence, both the redness of the face and the color of the urine derive from the heart and the small intestine, with the southern region displaying red externally. The classics describe the lower burner as a drain, referring specifically to the excretion of both urine and feces. Feces are yang, representing tangible transformation and thus belong to the lower burner. The kidneys are considered to govern feces, without mentioning the large intestine, indicating that disturbances in this area are deemed renal disorders.

If we analyze further, the water of the bladder (associated with the yin) conquers the fire of the small intestine (associated with the yang); hence, it does not transmit to the yin, resulting in blood leakage. Blood leakage and excess urination are due to tangible physical maladies, and since it does not transfer to the yin, the yin remains unaffected. What is a tangible illness? This pertains to the substance of the yin and the function of the bowels. The interplay of heaven and earth, yin and yang, mutually defines substance and function, as can be observed. Thus it is clear that the five organs are utilized by the six bowels while the six bowels are also utilized by the five organs. All tangible matters ultimately relate to the transmission of the yin. Incontinence of urine and feces is due to the bladder's failure to retain, resulting in involuntary urination, which does not transmit to the yin. This is caused by the cold affecting the elixir field, being overcome by the water element (associated with the bladder). Generally, all bowels bear tangible forms, and tangible illnesses are found within the bowels, while the responsibility lies within the organs. The use of subdued fire and cinnabar serves merely to eliminate cold properties.

The method should be to nourish the qi and blood so that the body fluids can replenish and flow freely. Misusing harsh laxatives can often result in dire consequences, and the harm from substances like croton seed is even more rapid. The Eight Treasure Decoction should be augmented with perilla seed, tangerine peel, apricot kernels, and cynomorium, and the amount of angelica should be doubled.

If the yin is agitated and feels like sitting in a well, pressing down two inches will yield a sensation of vacuity, or the pulse may be thin and slow; in such cases, one should prepare the decoction and wait until it is extremely cold before consuming it. If the medicine does not produce the expected response and one does not dare to use drastic measures, one should consider using honey to prepare it. Adding five grams of salt and five grams of locust bean powder to the honey preparation will enhance its effectiveness.

In acute cases, it is called urinary retention, characterized by difficulty in urination. In chronic cases, it is referred to as urinary dysfunction, where there are frequent but scanty urinations. The conditions of retention and dysfunction are categorized in the \"Inner Classic\" into the liver and the governor vessel, the sanjiao and the bladder channels. However, the taiyang bladder primarily governs the storage of urine, while its expulsion is the responsibility of the liver channel, the governor vessel, and the sanjiao. Furthermore, the bladder is considered the official for the distribution of fluids; when the fluids are transformed, they can be expelled. The channel responsible for transformation is the taiyin lung channel. If the lung is dry and cannot generate fluids, then the transformation cannot effectively reach the distribution organ. The treatment should focus on clearing the metal and nourishing the lungs, using herbs such as plantago, aster, ophiopogon, poria, and mulberry bark. If the spleen is damp and fails to ascend essence, the lungs will be unable to generate fluids. In this case, the treatment should aim to dry the spleen and strengthen the stomach, using herbs like dahurian angelica, white atractylodes, poria, and pinellia. If kidney water is dry and heated, leading to ineffective bladder function, the approach should be to nourish the kidneys and clear heat, using herbs such as phellodendron, anemarrhena, poria, alisma, and tetrapanax. Thus, nourishing the kidneys and draining the bladder is termed the appropriate treatment. Clearing the metal and moistening dryness is known as the second-tier treatment.

In the case of actual heat, unless using purely Yin agents, Yang cannot be transformed. For heat in the upper jiao, use Gardenia and Scutellaria; for heat in the middle jiao, use Coptis and Peony; for heat in the lower jiao, use Berberine and Anemarrhena. If there is significant deficiency, without using warming and tonifying agents, water cannot flow, such as with Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. Dan Xi once said: “I use the technique of vomiting to help urination, comparable to a water droplet vessel; if the upper orifice is closed, the lower orifice cannot open, hence it is essential for the upper orifice to open in order for the water below to flow.” For qi deficiency, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, first ingesting then purging. For blood deficiency, use Xiong Gui Tang, also first ingesting before purging. For excessive phlegm, use Er Chen Tang, similarly first ingesting then purging.

To summarize the key points: the lungs govern Qi, which facilitates the generation of fluids, distributing them to the bladder where bodily fluids are stored, and through transformation can be released.

A deficiency in the lungs indicates an upper deficiency; thus, one should tonify Qi with a formula like Ren Shen Bai Du San.

Generally, in warm weather, wearing thicker clothes leads to more sweating, whereas in cold weather, wearing lighter clothes leads to more urination. Increased urination is due to cold.

When the water pathway is obstructed, it invades and causes bloating in the spleen and stomach, leads to swelling in the muscles, results in vomiting when it affects the central region, and causes wheezing if it attacks the upper region. If it remains obstructed for several days, it can lead to urgent distress and must result in a critical condition. Nowadays, people encounter this symptom and only know to promote urination, or use methods like sealing the navel with a snail, without distinguishing the underlying causes, which explains why many remain untreated. In general, the causes of urinary retention fall into four categories, and it is essential to differentiate between deficiency and excess. If an obstruction in the small intestine and bladder is caused by fire pathogens, it is because the water source has dried up, and the gas orifices are hot and blocked. If heat settles in the liver and kidneys, it may lead to either depletion of essence or blood stagnation, blocking the water pathways. In such cases, there is in fact water present, but it is just obstructed; the excess can be cleared or promoted, and treatment options can be employed to facilitate this, which are lighter forms of urinary retention. However, when it comes to qi obstruction, the condition is particularly critical. There are two meanings to qi obstruction: one is due to excessive qi leading to blockage, and the other is due to deficient qi causing the blockage."},{"anchor":"trans-75p","marker":"75p","type":"translation","text":"The bladder serves as the organ that stores water, and the entry of water is transformed by qi; thus, where there is qi, there is water. The expulsion of water relies on water reaching qi; hence, when there is water, there is urination. The classics state: \"Qi transformation allows for expulsion.\" This implies that there must be transformation for entry before there can be transformation for exit; without transformation for entry, there can be no transformation for exit. Therefore, both entry and exit are dependent on qi transformation. This is the essence of qi transformation as stated in the classics, not merely discussing qi transformation in relation to exit alone. Thus, within water there is qi, and qi is water; within qi there is water, and water is qi. Now, whenever there is a disease characterized by deficient qi and obstruction, it is invariably due to the depletion of true yang, the root of the primordial sea is absent, water and fire do not interact, and yin and yang are separated. As a result, qi fails to transform into water, and water remains stagnant. When qi does not transform water, then the water organ becomes exhausted; when water is stagnant, it can lead to seepage and decay. If qi cannot transform but attempts to forcibly promote flow, will that truly work? In instances where there is no yang in yin, and one uses harsh cold medicines, what can that achieve? The principle is quite clear. As for qi being full yet obstructed, it is simply due to a strong liver causing qi to rebel, which obstructs the bladder, either breaking the qi or relieving the stagnation, or raising what has fallen – thus, any obstructions will naturally resolve. Treatment for fullness is not difficult, but treatment for emptiness must achieve transformation, which is not easy.

If the real fire of the liver and kidneys is not cleared, or if there is turbidity or blood seen, generally clearing away the fire will ensure that the water flows freely; all previous methods can be applied. In cases of Qi stagnation, treatment should distinguish between deficiency and excess, cold and heat. For instances of Qi excess, Qi is blocked between the small intestine and bladder, leading to obstruction, often due to the liver's strong Qi rebelling. Those who are prone to sudden anger and emotional restraint often exhibit this. It is advisable to focus on breaking Qi and promoting blood flow with herbs such as Xiang Fu, Zhi Ke, Wu Yao, Chen Xiang, and Hui Xiang, in conjunction with Si Ling San. If Qi is trapped below and the medicinal properties cannot immediately reach it, one should take these remedies in abundance and induce vomiting to raise the Qi, allowing the fluid to descend.

This is the natural principle of rise and fall. In cases where there is deficiency of Qi and difficulty urinating, it must be due to excessive loss of the foundational essence, or from aging and depletion of energy, leading to this condition. This is primarily because Qi is not being transformed, which is a critical situation. However, those suffering from this condition will experience gradual changes, noticing only a slight decrease in urination or difficulty during urination, so timely attention and treatment are essential. Waiting until it becomes severe may result in missed opportunities for intervention. When treating this condition, it is also important to distinguish between the cold and heat of the organ's Qi. If there is no internal heat present, it is undoubtedly a case of Yang deficiency. If the illness has not yet become serious, one should use formulas such as Zuogui, Yougui, Liuwai, or Bamei, or bolster water to clear the heat or enhance fire to transform the Qi, applying them as appropriate to gradually eliminate the root cause.

If qi is deficient and descending improperly, one should use a tonic like \"Buzhong Yiqi Decoction\" to address it, or this decoction might also be the best choice to induce vomiting. If one has a constitution with weak yang organs, internal heat unbearable to warming tonics, leading to urinary obstruction, it surely indicates a depletion of true yin; without yin, there can be no transformation of yang, resulting in water deficiency symptoms.

It will only lead to further depletion, which is dangerous. In cases where there is no water in the bladder, symptoms can arise from diarrhea causing water to return to the large intestine, resulting in difficulty with urination. This should be treated by addressing the diarrhea; when the diarrhea stops, the water will flow naturally. If a person experiences profuse sweating, resulting in difficulty with urination due to qi being lost through sweat, the treatment should involve regulating the nutritive and defensive qi, allowing urination to improve naturally. In cases of deficiency due to excessive labor and blood loss, where water is lost and the internal organs become dried out, leading to difficulty with urination, one must tonify the true yin.

Only in the case of diarrhea is there a potential for reducing fluids, and that is typically limited to a third of the time. These conditions do not indicate a blockage due to water not flowing; treatment should be sought from their respective paths. For pregnant women, if there is a difficulty with urination, it is often due to the pressure of the fetus pushing down, which compresses the urethra, typically because of qi deficiency that cannot lift the fetus.

In summary, all three cases are associated with deficiency, but there is a distinction between severity. If someone loses control in their dreams, it is mostly found in the young, and as their qi strengthens and consolidates, or with some appropriate adjustments, they can recover without doubt. However, if one cannot hold urine due to a continuous flow of water and weakened bladder, it is certainly due to deficiency of qi. Qi is the root of water; without sufficient qi, water cannot be retained, and only with qi can one hold it. This indicates a major issue of losing control, which is greatly undesirable. Particularly concerning is when qi escapes, leading to incontinence without awareness—it is much more critical. This is usually not related to wind conditions or individuals in old age with weakened qi, or often following severe illness. As Zhang Zhongjing stated: when the lower jiao is depleted, it leads to incontinence. This is what he meant. In ancient texts discussing urinary incontinence, there is a distinction between hot and weak conditions. It is misunderstood that incontinence is due to excessive urination, often indicating deficiency and coldness, not heat. When heat causes frequent urination, the symptoms may include profuse dribbling and inability to hold it, with possibly painful urination—these indicate heat conditions, which must be treated differently, not as loss of control. Should one mistakenly identify deficiency and cold as heat and recklessly administer purging medications, it would lead to severe consequences. ### Discussion on Treatment"},{"anchor":"trans-81p","marker":"81p","type":"translation","text":"In addressing the issue of frequent urination, traditional methods often rely on solidifying remedies, which is indeed appropriate. However, these remedies merely secure the openings and represent a symptomatic treatment rather than addressing the root cause. Although urination is linked to the kidneys, the kidneys are associated with the lungs; if lung qi is inadequate, the kidney water cannot be contained. Therefore, to manage water, one must also manage qi; to treat the kidneys, one must address the lungs. It is advisable to primarily use ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, cinnamon, prepared aconite, and dried ginger, and then appropriately add solidifying remedies. This approach may address the underlying cause and ensure continuous flow. Otherwise, it is merely a temporary fix without lasting benefit. I have formulated the Gongdi Pill for treatment, suitable for heart, spleen, lung, and kidney conditions, and it should be used as a primary remedy. In cases of spleen and lung qi deficiency, where the water pathways cannot be restricted, resulting in frequent urination, the issue lies within the upper and middle jiao. It is advisable to use formulas like Zhongy益气 Decoction, Lizhong Decoction, Wengwei Drink, Gui Spleen Decoction, or similar, adding solidifying remedies as the main treatment; if there is no improvement, one should then focus on the kidneys."},{"anchor":"trans-82p","marker":"82p","type":"translation","text":"If the yang energy of the liver and kidneys is deficient, then the bladder cannot hold, and the flow of water will not cease.

One can also use Jiyao Si Shen Pill or Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Pill without Ze Xie. For those who experience incontinence during sleep, it must be due to deficiency and coldness in the lower source, leading to a lack of stability. One should use Da Tu Si Zi Pill, Family Garlic Seed Pill, Wu Zi Pill, or Suo Quan Pill. If a child has been unrestrained since childhood, resulting in habitual incontinence, this is a matter of habitual behavior and lack of awareness, which is a mental issue. One should focus on treating the spirit, as medication cannot remedy it. If lax behavior leads to instability, it should be treated as previously described. It is advisable to use roasted pig or sheep urine as a decoction with the preceding medications for better effect. If incontinence occurs due to fear or anxiety, it indicates insufficient heart qi, leading to the connection between the heart, liver, and kidneys. Remedies such as Great Supplementing Yuan Decoction, Gui Pi Decoction, or Five Gentlemen Decoction should be utilized. Ancient formulas to strengthen the yang and stabilize the lower region, such as Fennel and Wisdom Pill, Erqi Dan, Guo Pao Wan, Miyuan Dan, Oyster Pill, Jisheng Tu Si Zi Pill, and Gu Zhen San, may all be selected and used as appropriate."},{"anchor":"trans-83p","marker":"83p","type":"translation","text":"**Secret Instructions of the Stone Chamber** **Dry Constipation** When dryness becomes severe and fire is intense, the yin of the large intestine is depleted, leading to feces resembling sheep droppings, known as intestinal obstruction, an untreatable condition. However, if the yin is depleted, death should follow. Currently, not dead but suffering from intestinal obstruction indicates that the yin is not yet completely exhausted. As long as true yin remains, one cannot die, and as long as there is a thread of life, there is potential for recovery. I have a unique formula that specifically nourishes the yin, allowing the yin to regenerate and the fire to subside; when the yin is abundant, the intestines will be relaxed. The formula to use is the “Yin Nourishing Opening Obstruction Decoction”: 2 liang of cooked rehmannia, 1 liang each of ophiopogon and angelica, 5 qian each of raw rehmannia, achyranthes, lily bulb, cornelian cherry, and processing with mild liquor, and 3 qian of Chinese yam, all decocted in water for consumption. After taking several doses, the intestinal obstruction can be relieved, and feces will no longer resemble sheep droppings, allowing hope for regeneration. However, it is essential to take one dose daily for three months, then switch to the “Six Flavor Rehmannia Decoction,” or instead of a decoction, use pills to adjust for over a year, thereby ensuring that there will be no more suffering from colon problems. As for those considering the cause of constipation to be excessive dryness of the large intestine, who knows it could be dryness of the lung qi? If the lungs are dry, the clearing and descending qi cannot flow down into the large intestine, and the water from the kidney channel is only enough to take care of itself; how could it flow out to moisten the streams? The formula to use consists of 3 liang each of cooked rehmannia and ophiopogon, 1 qian of hemp seed, and 2 qian of siler; boil with 1 bowl of cow's milk and 2 zhongs of water until reduced to six parts, then combine with the cow's milk and take 1 bowl.

When the qi flows downwards and settles at the bottom, without using methods to elevate and raise, water will become blocked and stagnant. By opening the upper orifice, the lower orifice will naturally flow; this is a method of treating lower ailments by addressing upper issues, and it is also a method of treating organ ailments through channel organs. The remaining methods for treating organ ailments can be understood from this. After a long illness, or if there is no bowel movement for a month, there is no need for haste; simply nourish the true yin, allowing the essence to be sufficient to generate blood, and the blood to be sufficient to moisten the intestines, thereby allowing bowel movements to occur naturally. The formula consists of 1 ounce each of cooked rehmannia, gardenia, and angelica, 5 qian of chuanxiong, 2 qian of hemp seed, half an ou of honey, 1 qian of rhubarb, 10 peach kernels, and 3 fen of safflower, which is decocted in water for consumption. This formula's brilliance lies in using cooked rehmannia, gardenia, and angelica to generate yin blood, with a slight addition of hemp seed and rhubarb to moisten the intestines for flow downwards.

In cases of dryness and severe obstruction, where the small intestine is too fine to allow for defecation and where the bloating is so severe that it feels life-threatening, these are conditions that cannot be treated merely as they are. What I wish to address is that the small intestine's opening and closing are managed by the kidneys. If one were to treat only the small intestine, it would become more vacuous, losing its role in transmission, leading to increased bloating. Therefore, I will not treat the small intestine directly but instead focus on the kidneys. By opening the kidney qi, the small intestine will also open.

There were no other symptoms; he often dared not eat to fullness, as doing so would lead to extremely difficult bowel movements, with stools as hard as iron or stone. Sometimes, he would go three to five days without a bowel movement, and when it occurred, it was painfully difficult. Blood would come from his nose, and he experienced pain in the anus and rectum. The pain was so extreme that it would cause fainting. When he took medicine, his condition worsened. He had tried various harsh laxatives like croton seed, bitter herb, and euphorbia, but excessive use only led to exhaustion, and stopping the laxatives led to dryness returning, resulting in this suffering lasting for several years. Frightened of the violent effects of these medications, he merely lay in bed and awaited death. When Dai arrived, he took the pulse of both hands and found it smooth, solid, and strong. He then administered a dose of the Big Cold Purging Decoction, followed by the Divine Efficacy Pill and Hemp Seed Pill. He instructed him to eat dishes made from soft vegetables and pig or beef blood, and after over a hundred days, his weight increased significantly, shocking his relatives. Alas! Inexperienced practitioners fail to recognize that dryness can be categorized into four types: external dryness manifests as wrinkled skin, internal dryness leads to depletion of essence and blood, upper dryness causes dryness in the throat and nose, while lower dryness results in constipation and urination difficulties. The disease of dryness arises from the transformation of the yangming, due to a cold and scanty presence of fluid. Thus, purging is necessary, but the right medicine must be chosen. For instance, croton seed can purge cold, bitter herb and euphorbia can relieve dampness, and rhubarb along with saline can purge dryness.

Day and night he could not sleep, unable to eat, suffering indescribable pain, and he sought my treatment. I inquired about the onset of his illness; he mentioned he felt no thirst and had bouts of severe vomiting. Various doctors all prescribed treatments for abdominal fullness and diuretics. Faced with an urgent situation, I returned home, and through the night until dawn, I was restless, pondering the matter deeply. Suddenly I recalled the \"Suwen\" stating: \"Without Yang, Yin cannot thrive; without Yin, Yang cannot transform.\" It also states: \"The bladder is the official responsible for the regions, where fluids are stored, able to expel when qi transforms.\" This illness of urinary retention is due to the absence of Yin, preventing the transformation of Yang energy.

Consequently, the bladder and kidney chambers become dry over time, and urination is not transformed, with fire rising to cause vomiting, which is not a condition caused by obstruction above. It is specifically related to the \"guan\" (barrier), not a disease of obstruction. The ancient elder Jie Gu stated: with heat in the lower jiao, it fills and obstructs. This is the method for treating obstructive conditions. The patient presents with both internal and external obstructive diseases, facing imminent death, yet treating the lower jiao may lead to recovery. One should adapt to the transformation of cold water from the North, using bitter cold herbs that are entirely yin, such as Huanglian, Zhimu, and Gui, formulated into pills the size of tung seeds. Boil them in water and take two hundred pills; shortly after taking the medicine, the anterior yin will feel as if stabbed by a knife and burned with pain, the urination will gush out like a waterfall, soaking the bedding, forming streams beneath the bed, and swelling will dissipate upon careful observation. I expressed my surprise, saying: \"Great are the words of the sage! How could one not thoroughly examine them and cling to but one!\" The evidence shows that when urination is obstructed but there is no thirst, and there are signs of agitation, this is it. Generally, all illnesses in the lower jiao do not present with thirst. The two types of illness, concerning qi and blood, are easiest to differentiate. The \"Danxi Heart Method\" states: Yang Chun had severe constipation, with urination normal, the throat obstructed, and phlegm appearing after eating. The pulse was thin, and both hands were the same. This is a severe case of spleen qi deficiency leading to dry intestines, for which Ren Shen San is the main treatment. A woman experienced abdominal pain and later suffered from obstructed urination and defecation. This is phlegm blocking the middle jiao, with qi stagnation in the lower jiao.

Additionally, he had difficulty urinating and experienced a distended sensation in his lower abdomen, which greatly troubled him; he could only manage to urinate by lying on his back. I said that the nourishing medicine had not yet reached him. I then doubled the dose of astragalus and ginseng, and after two days, his urination improved. A man presented with urinary obstruction, and the doctor prescribed diuretics, which worsened his condition. Danxi said: This is due to accumulated phlegm. The phlegm accumulates in the lungs, which is the upper jiao, while the bladder is the lower jiao. When the upper jiao is obstructed, the lower jiao is also blocked. This is like a dripping water vessel; both the upper and lower openings must be clear for the water to flow out. Therefore, he used a method of inducing vomiting to expel it. After vomiting, the illness seemed to be alleviated. This shows that urinary retention is not solely governed by the channels' diseases. Ma Xisheng, over fifty years old, had a fondness for alcohol and frequently drank heavily. The sediment would exit through the mouth, while urination occurred through the lower orifice. His six pulses were deep and sluggish. He was treated with the Four Substances Decoction, enhanced with peppermint, areca nut, peach kernel, and akebia, and he recovered.

The third is when the spleen and stomach qi is stagnant and failing to open the water passage, thus not transmitting to the bladder for transformation; this can be rectified by smoothing the qi to facilitate movement.

His constipation worsened, and he felt weak. I then prescribed supplements for Qi and Six-flavor Rehmannia, and after a month of treatment, he felt well again after a year. The official Meng had shortness of breath and phlegm problems, and after taking spicy and aromatic medicines, he developed excessive phlegm and urinary issues. His pulse was floating and large, and when pressed, it felt almost nonexistent. I believed there was a deficiency in the kidney unable to assimilate the Qi back to its source, with excessive dryness caused by the aromatic herbs. After three doses of the Eight Flavor Pill, he recovered. An elderly scholar had wind-heat symptoms, maintained normal eating habits, yet had not had a bowel movement for seventeen days. His abdomen was not swollen, and his pulse was floating, large, and weak. This indicated internal Yin Fire consuming bodily fluids. I prescribed over twenty doses of the Six-flavor Pill, and it took until the thirty-second day for him to have the desire to go. I used pig bile to moisten and clear his bowels. A seventy-three-year-old woman suffered from phlegm, wheezing due to internal heat, and had not had a bowel movement for two months, with insomnia. Her pulse was large and strong, yet weak upon heavy palpation. This indicated a deficiency in the liver, lungs, and kidneys. In the morning, I prescribed the Six-flavor Pill, and in the evening, the Free and Easy Wanderer Powder, each for over thirty doses.

After taking a laxative pill, he experienced constipation, chest and side pain, and wished to also take a pill for strengthening the spleen. His pulse was floating and thin in the liver, spleen, and kidney. I said: This indicates a deficiency of the three yin's essence and blood. Doctor Dongyuan said: If a person has a strong stomach but a weak spleen, it restricts the bodily fluids. When they cannot be distributed throughout but instead are directed to the bladder, resulting in frequent urination and difficulty with bowel movements, use the spleen-strengthening pill. If a person has dry yin blood with inner heat burning, the lung metal suffers from evil, and the earth is injured by wood affecting the spleen, causing the lungs to lose their transmission, then if there is constipation with frequent urination, use the laxative pill. Now, nourishing the source of transformation will naturally adjust the bowel movements. Follow this method, and it will be proven effective. A Confucian scholar, with feelings of depression and setbacks due to an unfinished task, developed a fever and thirst, and felt discomfort in his chest and diaphragm, along with decreased appetite. He took remedies to clear heat, transform phlegm, and move qi, but his prior symptoms worsened, and he felt fatigued with stagnation in the heart and spleen pulses. This indicated a change due to spleen damage from depression. Therefore, he was given a modified Gui Pi Decoction, and gradually, his appetite improved and symptoms receded. However, his bowel movements remained sluggish, and his cheeks were flushed red, indicating deficient kidney and liver heat harming yin blood.

He refused treatment, and later that was indeed the case. Zheng Fang, aged over sixty, first experienced constipation and took internal purgatives. Later, he had little appetite, felt bloated in the chest and abdomen, experienced pain in both sides, felt fatigued, and his pulses were wide at the distal points and thin on the left side, while the right side was wiry. It was May when he sought treatment. I concluded that the fire at the gate was weak and could not nourish the spleen, while the lung metal was suppressing the liver wood, fearing he would not recover during this strong metal phase. Later, that was indeed the case. Liu Tianxi had internal damp-heat, with stools being slippery and urine being difficult. After taking mild diuretics, the situation worsened, causing swelling in the lower abdomen and knees, and his eyes felt swollen and painful. This indicated kidney deficiency with heat in the lower jiao; taking mild diuretics harmed the yang energy, leading to no transformation of the yin. Thus, I prescribed Rehmannia and the Two Kidney Pills, but urination remained the same; I then added Bu Zhong Yi Qi and combined it with Wheat and Five Flavors for him to recover. A wealthy merchant neglected proper diet and daily routine, resulting in dry and firm stools, and often took intestinal lubricants. Later, he experienced chest and abdominal discomfort, lacked appetite, had a dry mouth, felt fatigued, and had fever with phlegm. After taking herbs like Er Chen and Huang Lian, his previous symptoms intensified, with dripping urination, diarrhea, bloating, and reduced appetite.

Minister Bian Huaquan frequently urinated, and his urine was scant, red, and painful, accompanied by dry mouth and phlegm. This indicated a deficiency of yang in the kidney leading to excessive heat. He was treated with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills and the Kidney Nourishing Pill and recovered. Examiner Yang Pu'an suffered from a dry mouth and frequent urination, indicating dryness in the bladder and a deficiency of yin. First, he used the Kidney Nourishing Pills to replenish yin, resulting in improved urination, followed by a combination of the Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi formula and the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pills to nourish the lungs and kidneys, achieving stability. A Confucian scholar often experienced fevers, drank water continuously, and suffered painful and difficult urination accompanied by painful bowel movements. This was due to exhaustion of essence. He was treated with the Six-Flavor Pills combined with five flavors, along with the Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi formula, achieving recovery through strict adherence. If he experienced cold limbs and preferred warm food and drink, the Eight-Flavor Pills were recommended. Liu Dacans, over sixty years of age, appeared weak and fragile, with frequent or involuntary urination, internal heat, dry mouth, and occasional coughs and wheezing. I suspected a deficiency in lung and kidney qi, so I prescribed the Six-Flavor Pills and Benefiting Qi Decoction to nourish the source of his condition.

The physician prescribed Ba Zheng San and similar remedies, but her urination did not improve, and she felt as if she was being pierced by thorns. I attributed it to dampness caused by excessive rain, believing that the pathogen remained on the surface. Therefore, I used Cang Zhu as the main ingredient and Fu Zi as an assistant to release it from the surface. After one dose, she sweated and her urination immediately became smooth. Ma Shen Zheng's father, aged eighty, initially suffered from short and frequent urination. After taking medicinal herbs, he experienced excessive urination leading to a complete blockage, with not a single drop coming out. I deduced that excessive consumption had harmed his stomach energy, causing his lower body to become deficient. I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and after one dose, his urination returned. Since he had previously taken too many diuretics, it had harmed his kidney energy, which caused him to experience nocturnal incontinence after correction. I urgently supplemented his kidney energy, and then the situation improved. In all medical treatments, there has never been a case where diuretic agents are not used; how could one care for the deficiency of kidney energy? For cases involving stagnant blood leading to urination difficulties, it is advisable to use a lot of Niu Xi. The \"Ben Shi Fang\" recounts that recently in Piling, the wife of a high official experienced an inability to urinate and unbearable abdominal swelling and pain. Numerous physicians treated her for dysuria with remedies like Ba Zheng San, yet her condition did not improve and worsened. Upon examination, I diagnosed it as blood stagnation, and no gentle remedies could resolve it. I then used a decoction of Tao Ren, which initially caused great pain around noon; shortly after, several blood clots the size of fists were expelled, and her urine flowed like black bean juice in one to two sheng, relieving the pain. This medicine is potent and should be used cautiously for those with weak energy and blood."},{"anchor":"trans-176p","marker":"176p","type":"translation","text":"In the \"Examination of Medical Prescriptions,\" it is stated: In the late Song dynasty, there was a physician named Xiong Yancheng, aged fifty-five, who suffered from an illness causing him difficulty with urination and bowel movements. For five days, his abdomen was swollen like a drum, and his peers looked on, all unable to provide help. He was close friends with the monk Huiyue from West Lake and sent a message inviting him for a final farewell. The monk hurriedly went, encountering a strange guest at Da Qiao, who greeted him, saying, \"Noble man from beyond the world, why do you hurry so?\" The monk replied, \"A good friend is suffering from a severe illness and is in critical condition; I wish to inquire about his health.\" The guest said, \"It's an easy matter. Allow me to prepare a medicine.\" He then took off his shoes and waded into the water, retrieving a large conch shell. He said, \"The matter is resolved.\" Upon returning home, he mixed half a spoon of salt with the conch shell, crushed it, and placed it an inch and three-fifths below the patient's navel, tightly binding it with a wide cloth, and also prepared a pot for urination to assist with his needs. The monk did not fully trust this approach and politely thanked him. When he arrived at Xiong's house, Yancheng was unconscious, and his wife and children were in tears. As other doctors had no other strategies, they cautiously tried this method. Without even taking a seat, the patient suddenly relieved himself. The doctors were ashamed and dispersed. The monk returned to inquire about the strange guest but could find no trace of him. Xiong lived for another sixteen years before passing away. The master stated that difficulty with urination and bowel movements is due to heat blockages. The conch shell has a cold nature and is good at dispersing and clarifying. In murky water, one touch of the conch can clear it. The salt is simply used for its moisture-retaining qualities."},{"anchor":"trans-177p","marker":"177p","type":"translation","text":"The \"寓意草\" (Meaning of Herbs) states: Jiang Yiren obtained a strange testimony, referring to the explanation in the \"Shen Nong's Classic of Materia Medica\" regarding the treatment of intestinal disorders with the Wuling Decoction, deeming it mysterious. I observed this and clarified: the symptom of intestinal disorder involves both bowel movements, which can interchange as if they were trading. In ancient times, Wuling was used specifically to clear the front passage. If the symptoms are confined to the rear passage, with both bowel movements originating from the front, likening it to intestinal disorders indeed presents a chance of misunderstanding. Furthermore, intestinal disorders arise suddenly as a violent illness, causing chaotic qi within. This condition, in contrast, results from a chronic illness, where blood gradually depletes internally, showcasing a significant difference. How can they be compared? The root of illness begins with worry and grief, which can damage the spleen. The spleen regulates blood, and if it is damaged, it cannot control the flow, leading to erratic discharges similar to excessive bleeding or loss of vitality. In such cases, great supplementation and stabilization are necessary. However, if this is mistakenly treated as excessive bleeding, using methods to cool the blood and clear fire, the outflow will only increase. One fails to consider that with the end of the Tide of Life, there is no illness present. When one is aged and qi is weak, the absence of sufficient blood to control leads to neglect. As a result, the blood to the passages diminishes day by day, compelling the need to borrow resources from the large intestine, which in turn causes blood from the large intestine to seep into the reproductive organ. Over time, the blood from the large intestine also depletes, and its qi, which moves with the blood, becomes isolated and aimless, leading to chaos much like the calamities faced by the woods and waters."},{"anchor":"trans-178p","marker":"178p","type":"translation","text":"Moreover, like those who save from disaster, they strip neighboring countries to establish a desolate place that they disregard. Yet it is still not enough. When the stomach area is nourished, the blood from the stomach area is drawn and seeps into the body’s cavities; after a long time, the blood of the stomach runs out, and the blood that is expelled has no source to stop it. The blood of the stomach is what nourishes the body and fills the meridians; now that it has become dark and returns to nothingness, the grass loses its moisture and the feet suffer worry. When the blood is exhausted and stops, it is far worse than when there is blood but it flows out. Thus, after the blood runs out, the qi becomes chaotic; when the qi is chaotic, the water and grains are neglected and therefore turn to new sources, neglecting spaciousness for narrowness. The channels of the Yangtze and Han rivers converge into one path, resulting in great chaos within the body. The large intestine must reopen its original pathway to restore order, and this has no relation to the prescription of Wuling. Furthermore, since the water and grains pass from the stomach to the intestines with a separate pylorus that distinguishes between the clear and the turbid, if due to the seepage of blood there arises a grain pathway, the pylorus becomes a smooth route. Is it still possible to reopen it with Wuling? Moreover, the affliction of Wuling is deeply cautioned against by those who worry about lost blood. Nowadays, seeing a single ailment, one often has a remedy obstructing the chest; as for those who uphold established prescriptions as spiritual secrets, most tend to mislead others. If one is to address someone’s ailment, I merely need to place three fingers lightly and then ask: “Are there frequent weeping episodes?” If a maid or elderly woman replies: “I weep often,” then it is known that dryness within the organs causes excessive weeping, and the large intestine is currently useless. What of the intestinal channels? Now, if the pulse of the large intestine is evident in the fingers, is it possible to predict when the spring jujube leaves will come?
