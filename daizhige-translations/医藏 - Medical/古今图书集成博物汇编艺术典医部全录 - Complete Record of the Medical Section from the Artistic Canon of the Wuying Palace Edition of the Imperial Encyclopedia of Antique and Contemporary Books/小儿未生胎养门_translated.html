<p>On Prenatal Care for Unborn Children</p>
<pre><code>      Biographies of Notable Women<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a>
</code></pre>
<h3>Theory of Prenatal Education</h3>
<p>In ancient times, when a woman was pregnant, she should not lie on her side, sit at an angle, or stand without a support. She should avoid bad tastes in her food, refrain from eating improperly cut food, and should not sit on a misaligned seat. She should avert her gaze from improper sights and close her ears to lewd sounds. At night, she should have a blind person recite poetry and discuss proper matters, so that her child will be born with a proper appearance and surpass others in talent.</p>
<h3>Theory of Nurturing the Fetus</h3>
<p>It is an old saying that during the first three months of conception, the fetus undergoes various changes, and its qualities are not yet determined. Therefore, during these three months, if one wishes to witness rare natural phenomena, fierce beasts, precious jewels, or fine materials, or desires to see virtuous gentlemen with great moral character, one should observe ceremonial music and military arrangements, burn fragrant incenses, and orally recite poetry and ancient maxims. Living and dwelling in a tranquil environment, avoiding improperly cut food and misaligned seating, playing the guqin, and adjusting the mind and feelings are important; moderation in desires and maintaining purity in all matters will result in a good child who will live long, be loyal, filial, benevolent, righteous, wise, and free of ailments. This is the essence of King Wen&#39;s prenatal education.</p>
<p>While a child is in the womb, the lunar and solar cycles are not yet complete, the yin and yang are not balanced, and the organs, bones, and joints have not fully formed. Thus, from the beginning of pregnancy until childbirth, there are various dietary prohibitions.</p>
<p>Eating lamb liver during pregnancy can result in a difficult child; eating goat meat can lead to frequent illnesses. Eating donkey or horse meat can prolong the child&#39;s gestation; eating mule meat can make childbirth difficult. Eating rabbit or dog meat can result in a child born mute or with a cleft lip. Eating chicken or glutinous rice can lead to the child having many white worms.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>If a woman is pregnant and eats chicken eggs and dried carp, her child will have many sores.<br>If she eats mulberries and duck, her child will be born with a cold heart.<br>If she eats sparrow meat and soybean paste, her child will have a darkened face filled with spots.<br>If she eats sparrow meat and drinks alcohol, her child will be lustful and emotionally chaotic, lacking a sense of shame.<br>If she eats turtle, her child will have a short neck.<br>If she consumes ice and frost, it will result in miscarriage.<br>During pregnancy, she should not urinate in unusual places, as it may lead to the death of the child.<br>Moreover, it is said: The third month of pregnancy is called the beginning of the fetus; at this time, the shape is not yet established, and it changes according to what it sees. To conceive a boy, one should handle bows and arrows; to conceive a girl, one should play with pearls and jewels. If one desires a beautiful child, one should often gaze at jade; if one desires a virtuous child, one should sit upright in a tranquil state. This is called external appearance impacting internal feelings.  </p>
<p><strong>From &quot;Good Remedies for Women&quot; by Chen Ziming from the Song Dynasty</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>On Prenatal Education</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;On the Sources of Illness&quot; by the Chao Clan: In the first month of pregnancy, it is called the embryo, nurtured by the Foot Jueyin meridian; in the second month, it is called the initial essence, nurtured by the Foot Shaoyang meridian; in the third month, it is called the initial fetus, nurtured by the Hand Shenzong meridian. At this time, blood does not circulate, and forms start to take shape, without fixed features, thus subject to change due to external influences. To ensure the child is upright and dignified, one should often speak of proper words and act in accordance with virtuous deeds. If desiring a son, one should wear string and hold bow and arrows; if wanting a daughter, one should wear a belt and adorn with pendants. To have a beautiful child, one should wear white jade; to have an able and wise child, one should read poetry and books. This is known as the external appearance that inwardly influences. In the fourth month, the essence of water begins to form the blood vessels, nurtured by the Hand Shaoyang meridian; in the fifth month, the essence of fire begins to form the qi, nurtured by the Foot Taiyin meridian; in the sixth month, the essence of metal begins to form the muscles, nurtured by the Foot Yangming meridian; in the seventh month, the essence of wood begins to form the bones, nurtured by the Hand Taiyin meridian; in the eighth month, the essence of earth begins to form the skin, nurtured by the Hand Yangming meridian; in the ninth month, the essence of stone begins to form the hair, nurtured by the Foot Shaoyin meridian; by the tenth month, the five organs, six bowels, joints, and spirit are all complete. This summarizes the general principles. Additionally, there is a discussion from the theory on the five organs that describes the development: In the first month, like a dewdrop; in the second month, like a peach blossom; in the third month, distinctions between male and female; in the fourth month, the form is complete; in the fifth month, muscles and bones are formed; in the sixth month, hair begins to grow; in the seventh month, the soul can wander, and the child can move its left hand; in the eighth month, the spirit can wander, and the child can move its right hand; in the ninth month, it can turn three times; in the tenth month, it receives complete essence.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Moreover, the &quot;Lú Huān Jīng&quot; states: In the first month, the fetus is formed from the coagulation of essence and blood; in the second month, the fetal shape is established, and the embryo is formed; in the third month, the yang spirit corresponds to the three souls; in the fourth month, the yin spirit corresponds to the seven corporeal souls; in the fifth month, the five elements correspond to the five organs; in the sixth month, the six laws establish the six entrails; in the seventh month, the essence opens the orifices to connect with brightness; in the eighth month, the original spirit possesses the true spirit; in the ninth month, the palace is adorned to define the birth of a person; in the tenth month, upon receiving sufficient qi, all manifestations are complete. </p>
<p>Now, upon examining these numerical statements: those who speak of the five organs, for example, are merely shallow and ludicrous, falsely attaching their names; as for the three collections of Buddhist texts, they delve into the bizarre and are hard to verify. According to the three volumes of the &quot;Lú Huān Jīng,&quot; written by ancient magicians, certain thoughts on pregnancy assert that the fetus begins to take shape after three months. If one wishes to discuss correct words, conduct proper actions, wear cords of leather, handle bows and arrows, adorn with rings, don white jade, and read poetry and texts, could this not align with the principles of prenatal education? Let us consider what the Nesting Clan discussed, stating the principles of nurturing during pregnancy.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>If considering the liver meridian of the foot&#39;s Jueyin, and the gallbladder meridian of the foot&#39;s Shaoyang, they are part of one organ&#39;s channel, and the rest are similar. Moreover, the regulations of the four seasons must begin with the spring wood; hence, the nourishment of the twelve channels begins with the liver, which is why fetal nourishment occurs in the first and second months. The hand&#39;s heart protector meridian and the hand&#39;s Shaoyang Sanjiao meridian correspond to fire and are strong in summer, which is why nourishment for the fetus occurs in the third and fourth months. The hand&#39;s Taiyin and hand&#39;s Yangming are the heart meridians; being the officials of the sovereign, they are elevated without action. The foot&#39;s Taiyin spleen meridian and the foot&#39;s Yangming stomach meridian belong to earth and thrive in late summer, which is why fetal nourishment occurs in the fifth and sixth months. The hand&#39;s Taiyin lung meridian and the hand&#39;s Yangming large intestine meridian belong to metal and are strong in autumn, hence, fetal nourishment occurs in the seventh and eighth months. The foot&#39;s Shaoyin kidney meridian belongs to water and is strong in winter, so fetal nourishment takes place in the ninth month. Furthermore, the mother&#39;s kidneys are connected to the fetus, as they contain the mother&#39;s true qi, on which the child depends. By the tenth month, the child is nourished in the mother’s womb by the qi of all the organs and channels, awaiting the right time to be born. This discussion is profound and contains utmost principles. There are those in the world who are even more enlightened, but none surpass the theories of the Nestorian. I therefore recount this view.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>The Nest Theory states: Yang manifests and Yin transforms, when the essential energy is ample, there are cases of twins of both male and female. The Taoist Canon says: If a woman has relations on the first, third, or fifth day after her menstrual period on days favorable for male and female, there is a greater chance of conceiving a son. If both male and female contributions are robust, then there will be many children; if one is weak, there will be fewer children. The Luo Han Scripture states: When Yang is vigorous, it will produce a male. Various meridians all emphasize Yin. It also states: When three Yang gather, a male is born; when three Yin gather, a female is born. Ge Xianweng&#39;s &quot;After Elbow Formulas&quot; says: Males derive from the father&#39;s energy, females derive from the mother&#39;s energy. The Holy Medicinal Canon states: The virtue of heaven, the energy of earth, the utmost harmony of Yin and Yang, flows thinly into one body.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Due to the movement of energy, if it moves to the left, it belongs to Yang, and when Yang is nourished, it becomes male; if it moves to the right, it belongs to Yin, and when Yin is nourished, it becomes female. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states that the path of the dry leads to the creation of males, while the path of the receptive leads to the creation of females; this is the distinction between men and women. </p>
<p>In cases of pregnancy with complications, administering decoctions will reduce symptoms by more than half, allowing the illness to pass and the mother to be at peace, so the fetus remains unharmed. </p>
<p>According to Dongyuan and Danxi: when the menstrual flow ceases for one or two days, the blood ceases its flow, and if the essence prevails over the blood, the result is male; after four or five days, the blood vessels become strong, and if the essence cannot prevail over the blood, the result is female. This is due to the interaction of paternal essence and maternal blood. When the essence is applied, the blood can capture the essence, hence resulting in a male; this is how all things begin from the creative principles of Yang. When the blood flows, the essence cannot capture it, hence resulting in a female; this signifies that all things are born from the receptive principles of Yin. </p>
<p>When Yin and Yang interact, the embryo begins to form, and the place where it resides is termed the &quot;child&#39;s palace.&quot; It has one extension downward, leading to two branches, one to the left and one to the right.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>If the essence overcomes the blood, then the yang becomes the master, receiving energy from the left uterus, resulting in the formation of a male; if the essence does not overcome the blood, then the yin becomes the master, receiving energy from the right uterus, resulting in the formation of a female. This is a definitive theory regarding the matters of conception. As for the medications for pregnancy, they should be restricted, and one should refer to this domain for further examination. </p>
<p>According to the Chu family, the union of male and female involves mutual affection. The yin blood arrives first, followed by the yang essence; the blood envelops the essence, which then enters the bones, resulting in the formation of a male. Conversely, if the yang essence enters first and the yin blood follows, it envelops the blood, which then becomes the foundation, resulting in a female. The yang energy gathers in the front, thus men have a heavier face; those who die from drowning must face down. The yin energy gathers in the back, hence women have a heavier back; those who drown must lie on their backs. This is true for both wild animals, regardless of how they die. When yin and yang are equally present, it is neither male nor female; when essence and blood are scattered, it foretells the signs of twin births. If the father is young and the mother is old, a female offspring will surely be weak; if the mother is strong and the father is weak, a male offspring will surely be frail.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>In ancient times, skilled artisans first examined this. When the vital energy is deficient, it should be replenished accordingly. To nourish weak women, invigorate the blood and strengthen the spleen; for weak men, enhance the kidneys and enrich their essence. Weak women should marry at an appropriate time, while weak men should wait until they are robust before marrying. This is the root of external afflictions; it must not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Yiqing argues that books on prenatal education and childbirth should not be dismissed as too antiquated to be credible, yet they should not be treated carelessly. Nowadays, families of common customs and improper practices may neglect proper precautions and rituals. Sometimes they suffer from poisons that cannot be expelled or give birth under adverse conditions, yet there are some fortunate enough to have healthy mothers and children. If one wishes to protect pregnancy, one must nurture in many ways to avoid future troubles. Just as if a neighbor undertakes construction, it may disturb the fetal energy, causing the child to be deformed or perish. </p>
<p>If a knife strikes, the body must be injured; if mud is involved, the orifices will surely be blocked; if struck, the complexion will turn dark; if bound, the body will be restricted. Such experiences are as clear as the hand before the eye, and caution must be exercised.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>The Chapter on the Root of the Universe</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, there was the Great Primal (Tai Chu) and the Great Beginning (Tai Shi). When chaos was first distinguished, the vital essence was seen; hence it is called the Great Primal. When forms were established, it is then termed the Great Beginning. As essence first takes shape and forms begin, heaven and earth mutually originate, generating and transforming endlessly, the myriad things become manifest. Thus it is said, &quot;Great indeed is the origin of Heaven, for it is the source of all things; profound indeed is the origin of the Earth, for it is the source of all life.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: Wu Yu&#39;s commentary states that before chaos was distinguished, essence and form were both non-existent; once chaos was distinguished, essence and form were separate. The sighting of essence is the Great Primal; the establishment of forms is the Great Beginning. The Great Primal is the root of all that has essence; therefore, heaven obtains it to govern the primal essence. The Great Beginning is the root of all that has form; therefore, the earth gains it to govern the primal form. When heaven and earth interact harmoniously, they are mutually caused by essence and form; that which generates life does so, and that which transforms is able to transform, while the myriad things move and their shapes, colors, and names are all made clear. Considered great is the origin of Heaven, where the Great Primal resides, hence the reference to it as the source of all things. Considered profound is the origin of the Earth, where the Great Beginning resides, hence the reference to it as the source of all life. Truly, all things derive their genesis and sustenance from Heaven and Earth; thus, the origin of Heaven brings forth omens, while the origin of Earth ensures all forms come into being.)<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>At the beginning of existence, although the Yang is in its proper form, it is the Yin that serves as the master as it nurtures and fulfills. </p>
<p>As stated in Xue&#39;s Commentary on the Theory of Yin and Yang: Heaven covers, and Earth supports; all things are born. That which has not yet emerged from the Earth is termed Yin and is named the Yin within Yin; that which has emerged is termed Yang and is named the Yin within Yang. The Yang is in its proper form, while the Yin is the master. According to Wang Bing, the Yang imparts upright energy, allowing all things to be born; the Yin, being the master, allows various forms to manifest. The &quot;Character Explanations&quot; states: The initiator of life is Heaven and Earth; the nurturer is humanity.</p>
<p>As forms change and shift, day transforms into night, and the way of the Earth ultimately concludes. </p>
<p>As noted in the &quot;Liezi,&quot; in the Zhou Mu chapter, Master Yin Wen states: The transformation of forms is called change. In the &quot;Zhuangzi,&quot; the chapter on Tian Zifang says: The alternation of fullness and emptiness, one dark and one bright; day transforms into night, and each has its role, yet the results are often unseen. The text of the Earth Hexagram in the &quot;I Ching&quot; says: The way of Earth has no permanence but does have an end. The Earth bears Heaven, existing without permanence but having an end; is it forced by circumstances? The source of the way lies where, if living things are deprived of it, they die; if they have it, they live. In this, all beings heed its command. Thus, it is said that there is no permanence, yet an end exists—this is the teaching of the way.</p>
<p>This state is termed pregnancy; once the Yang has been received, the Yin commences it.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>【Note: In the &quot;Character Explanations&quot;: Renzi is referred to as pregnancy. Ren represents one yang, while Zi represents two yins. When the yang has begun to receive, the yin follows in Ren. Explanation: Ren is the dry of yang water, positioned between Hai and Zi. When yin reaches its extreme in Hai, yang once again conceives, thus it is called pregnancy in Ren, leading to birth in Zi.】 This is referred to as the womb, where the correct yang is already, enveloped by yin.<br>【Note: Si is indeed the correct yang, while yin is capable of enveloping it; yin and yang interchange in their functions. Si represents the month of early summer, in which the hexagram is dry, pure yang is in action, hence the poem calls it the first month. The first month is thus the month of correct yang, where yin acts as the master of things; therefore, though it is correct yang, it is still enveloped and listens in retreat.】 This is called the embryo, which has not yet formed into a vessel, akin to clay.<br>【Note: In the &quot;Explanations of Characters&quot;: Unfired tiles are called clay. The embryo refers to a woman one month pregnant. &quot;Character Explanations&quot;: An embryo has not yet formed into a vessel, similar to clay.】 This is referred to as the fetus, which has already been nourished by the mother, serving as the mouth.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>【Note: According to &quot;Shuowen,&quot; the term &quot;胎&quot; (tai) refers to a woman&#39;s pregnancy after two months. &quot;Zishuo&quot; states that the original embryo, once nourished by the mother, forms a mouth.】 If one conceives, it is in accordance with the right timing.</p>
<p>【Note: &quot;Zishuo&quot; mentions that a woman conceives in accordance with time.】 If one is pregnant, then one relies on the body to support it.</p>
<p>【Note: &quot;Zishuo&quot; states that the heart harbors the pregnancy and the eyes are attentive to it.】 The virtue of Heaven, the energy of Earth, the ultimate harmony of yin and yang, flow together in one entity. </p>
<p>【Note: &quot;Lingshu Jing&quot; states: the virtue of Heaven resides in me, the energy of Earth resides in me; virtue flows and energy is thin, giving birth.】 Only by being able to follow the proper timing, being cautious in human affairs, avoiding harm, can the path of reproduction be achieved.</p>
<p>【Note: This refers to the accumulation from the first month to the tenth month, which is called the proper timing. Protecting, assisting, and preventing unnecessary actions, while being suitable, is referred to as human affairs.】 Observing the movements of the four seasons, the growth and collection, the emergence of myriad things, all forms are complete, yet the energy of Heaven and Earth has never been lacking, for yin and yang nourish and support each other.</p>
<p>【Note: The Theory of Yin and Yang states: Heaven covers, Earth supports, and all things collectively emerge. Yang represents what is proper, while yin is the chief. Therefore, spring brings forth life, summer nurtures, autumn harvests, and winter stores; if these patterns are lost, then Heaven and Earth are blocked.】<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>In the chapter of Heaven and Earth from the &quot;Zhuangzi,&quot; it says: Life flows and gives birth to all things. The principles of creation are termed forms. The preservation of spirit within each form, each having its own characteristics, is called nature. Those who are ignorant do not understand this; they desire to go against the principles of nature and mistakenly seek methods of cessation, thus applying the concept of life and death to the five elements and seeking nourishment in herbs and stones, attempting to conquer reality with falsehood and human effort against the will of heaven. Although some may conceive, many become pregnant but do not give birth, and among those who do give birth, many do not live long. </p>
<p>In ancient discussions on aging and having children, it was stated that for men this would not extend beyond the age of eighty-eight and for women, not beyond seventy-seven, thus revealing that the vital essence within a person is inherently limited. Could one truly escape the fixed principles of yin and yang? </p>
<p>In the discourse on nature, the Emperor asks: What about those who are older yet still have children? Qi Bo replies: This occurs when their heavenly lifespan is excessive, their vital energy is regularly flowing, and their kidney energy is abundant. Although such individuals may have children, men will not exceed the age of eighty-eight and women will not exceed seventy-seven, after which the essence of heaven and earth is depleted.</p>
<p>(Note: Even though one may produce children in old age, the lifespan of these children cannot exceed the heavenly limit.)<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>On the Distinct Forms and Vital Energies</strong></p>
<p>Heaven and Earth are the grand expressions of form. Yin and Yang are the great manifestations of energy. Only form and energy rely on each other to stand; neither has ever been neglected.</p>
<p>Men and women mingle their essences, and all things are transformed and born; the forms and energies of Heaven, Earth, Yin, and Yang are contained within this.</p>
<p>When we speak of the numbers seven and eight: seven represents lesser Yang, while eight embodies lesser Yin. They resonate and flow together, hence when a woman reaches her second cycle of seven years and her vital essence appears, and a man reaches the second cycle of eight years, achieving harmony in essence, it is through the union of Yin and Yang that new beginnings are signified.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>It is said: A girl at fourteen has the way of becoming a mother; at forty-nine, she ends her ability to bear children. A boy at sixteen has the way of becoming a father; at sixty-four, he loses his ability for fatherhood. The number ninety corresponds to the ninth elder, who represents yang, while the tenth elder represents yin. They encompass each other, thus form is generated. Consequently, yin culminates in ten, which men can encircle, while yang culminates in nine, which women can square. This interdependence of yin and yang results in the completion of life.</p>
<p>Commentary: &quot;Zi Shuo&quot; states: Yin culminates in ten, men encircle it; yang culminates in nine, women square it. Nine has transformative potential, so women can square it. Ten has no transformations, so men can encircle it. Explanation: Men have homes to encircle the yin externally; women have households to contain the yang internally. The &quot;I Ching&quot; says: The fortune of a woman corresponds to unity and completion. The doctrine of the husband is defined by misfortune for the woman. Circles symbolize encirclement, representing the way of the ruler and of the husband. A circle allows for the systematization of principles in action. Squares symbolize benevolence, representing the way of subjects and of wives. A square represents pure unity. Men follow the circle, aligning with their principles; women adhere to benevolence, aligning with their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Vital energy flourishes and is nurtured, all beginning with the child. Following from the child: the boy moves leftward in three decades and reaches maturity; the girl moves rightward in two decades and reaches maturity. The mature stage corresponds with the correct yang, from which yin genuinely follows. From this mature stage, pregnancy begins: the boy rotates leftward for ten months and is born in the year of the tiger; the girl rotates rightward for ten months and is born in the year of the monkey.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The Shen corresponds to the three Yin, and the Yin corresponds to the three Yang, which signifies the time of birth and reproduction. In its allocations, there are elements of hardness and softness, strength and weakness in the pulse, abundance and scarcity in the energy (Qi), and flourishing and declining in the blood; all these are determined and unchanging.</p>
<p>(Note: The text mentions that men born in the Yin (寅) belong to wood and are Yang, while women born in the Shen (申) belong to metal and are Yin. According to Yang’s commentary, the primal energy arises in the Zi, where humans are born. Men move left from Zi by thirty, while women move right by twenty, both arriving at the Yi, representing husband and wife conceiving. In ancient times, men married at thirty and women at twenty. A ten-month gestation results in men being born from the Si, moving left to Yin for ten months, and women from the Si, moving right to Shen for ten months.)</p>
<p>As for different regions and environments, the yields are appropriate to their quantities; auspicious events bring favorable omens, and dreams align with their kinds. Hence, in places like Jing and Yang with thin soil, there are more daughters; in Yong and Ji with rich soil, there are more sons. The bear and tiger are auspicious signs for males, while snakes and vipers are auspicious signs for females. All these can be reasonably deduced.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Note</strong>: The &quot;Zhouguan Zhi&quot; states that in Yangzhou, there are three males and five females among the people; in Jingzhou, one male and two females; in Yongzhou, three males and three females; and in Jizhou, five males and three females. From the &quot;Shijing,&quot; the poem &quot;Si Gan&quot;: What does a good dream signify? It signifies bears and tigers, serpents and snakes; great men interpret these. Bears and tigers signify auspiciousness for males, while serpents and snakes signify auspiciousness for females. </p>
<p>The method of fetal transformation includes what is said about turning females into males, which is all natural. For example, eating a male rooster extracts yang essence from what is obtained from heaven; using realgar, one extracts yang essence from the earth. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: From &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot;: To transform a female into a male, one can use Dan Shen pills made with the head of a male rooster from Dongmen. Another recipe: take one tael of realgar and enclose it in a crimson pouch. From &quot;Bencao&quot;: The male rooster replenishes the weak and warms the center, opens the mind, and kills toxins; it nourishes the liver and replenishes the kidneys, and its comb enriches yang. Realgar, when worn, wards off spirits and cannot be harmed by toxins. </p>
<p>Drawing the bow and arrows, using axes and chisels, refers to employing hard materials in human affairs; the essence of these things subtly connects, and creation transforms discreetly, signaling the form before the third month. Essentially, when the form is not yet fully manifested, yang can conquer yin, and it is indeed reasonable to transform a female into a male. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Nest Scholar&#39;s theory states: pregnancy begins in the third month when the fetus starts taking shape. The form has not yet been fixed, and manifesting depends on changes in what is perceived. To seek a male, one should draw bows and arrows and eat a male rooster.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Chapter on the Generation of Qi and Essence</strong></p>
<p>The nature of heaven and earth is endowed with qualities; the essence of all things gathers their spiritual energy. Yin and Yang are balanced, and Qi and essence are complete, thus forming their shapes. However, there are peculiar pairs and different numbers, leading to growth and decline; the rigidity and flexibility are used differently, sometimes strong, sometimes weak. The blood nourishes, and Qi envelops; they cannot escape the principles of fullness and emptiness. Therefore, regarding one&#39;s innate qualities, can they be generalized? Thus, those with appendages, unusual fingers, or dwarfed and limping forms have their shapes and Qi determined as such. Conditions like sores, swellings, deafness, blindness, muteness, emaciation, and fatigue are all diseases of Qi and form. Nevertheless, at the beginning of embryonic formation, after the essence transforms into Qi, the protection and support are certainly part of the way. </p>
<p>(Note: The &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot; states that the nature of heaven and earth gives priority to humanity. The &quot;Book of Documents&quot; says that humanity is the spirit of all things.)<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Heaven has five vital energies, each harmonizing with its own; earth has five flavors, each nourishing its own. The harmonization has its timing, and the nourishment has its measures. All that is to be feared and avoided should be thoroughly understood and cautiously regarded. The resources for sustenance are thus, naturally. Therefore, rest and activity should align with the times, and comings and goings should adhere to moderation.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Sixteen Classes of Hidden Symbols,&quot; it is said that heaven nourishes humans with five vital energies, and earth nourishes humans with five flavors. Wang Bing states: Heaven nourishes people with the five energies where the sour energy corresponds to the liver, the bitter energy corresponds to the heart, the sweet energy corresponds to the spleen, the pungent energy corresponds to the lungs, and the salty energy corresponds to the kidneys. </p>
<p>The five flavors from the earth enter as follows: sour enters the liver, bitter enters the heart, sweet enters the spleen, pungent enters the lungs, and salty enters the kidneys. It is possible to be insightful and meticulous, ensuring that fog, dew, windy disturbances do not intrude, and thus the nourishment should follow the natural order of timing. Hence, it is necessary to regulate joy and anger, and to reduce excessive desires.</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of pregnancy, one must carefully avoid the harm of miscarriage during the prenatal period. </p>
<p>Once conception occurs, one should diligently avoid anything that might harm the fetus.

<p>When the spirit is within the house, it is not advisable to arrange beds or hang canopies at certain positions, nor is it appropriate to sweep the house, as this is ominous. Additionally, there are prohibitions related to killing young children, the inherent risks of the current year, and not harming the mother during childbirth. All pregnant women should display this in their homes and ensure they see it regularly. It is crucial to avoid digging, relocating, hammering fences, and the like. Violating these prohibitions could lead to severe consequences such as loss of the fetus or harm to the mother; if not severe, the child may be deformed or suffer disabilities. Such violations cause dire outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>After conception, there are many foods that should be avoided not only for the sake of the fetus&#39;s well-being but also for physical properties that should be heeded. If one cannot adhere to these restrictions, there will not only be delays in labor but also risks to the child&#39;s development and the mother&#39;s health.

<p>In ancient times, prenatal teaching was detailed in various texts, and there is no need for me to elaborate. However, regarding diseases during pregnancy, it is often vague and unclear, as many overlook its significance, and physicians do not always understand it. A child in the womb shares the mother’s body; if she is warm, the child is warm; if cold, so is the child; if she is sick, the child is sick; if well, the child is well. Therefore, the mother’s diet and daily activities must be particularly cautious, as ignorance could lead to trouble.</p>
<p><strong>On Fetal Perception</strong></p>
<p>The discussion about the differentiation of sexes after conception, based on essence and blood, is from the argument of Chu Cheng. I find it quite perplexing. Later, I read Li Dongyuan&#39;s theory which states: if menstruation ceases one or two days later, and the blood sea begins to clear, the essence dominates the blood, resulting in a male; but if it is four to five days later, and the blood vessels are robust, the essence cannot overcome the blood, resulting in a female. This theory, however, remains unclarified. Why do I say this? The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: the dry principle produces males, and the moist principle produces females. The concepts of dry and moist refer to the nature of yin and yang. Left and right represent the pathways of yin and yang. Males and females are the symbols of yin and yang. The father’s essence and mother’s blood converge through perception. The release of essence is the expression of yang. Blood can contain it, representing the transformation of yin. The essence forms the bones; this marks the beginning of all things from the dry source. Blood forms the womb; this nourishes all things from the moist source. When yin and yang intersect, conception occurs. The place where the fetus resides is called the uterus. It is connected below, with two branches above reaching left and right. When the essence dominates the blood and is stimulated during the active period of the sun, it is thus male that is formed, receiving qi from the left side of the uterus.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>When the essence is insufficient to outweigh the blood, and during the times influenced by soft sunlight and阴 (yin), then the阴 (yin) becomes the dominant force, receiving energy from the right ovary, thus forming a female. Some ask: If there is division between male and female, what happens to twins? It is said: When the essence is plentiful, it diverges and splits, and the blood follows this division. As for simultaneous pregnancies of both male and female, during the strong sunlight of the day or the soft sunlight of the yin, when influenced, the energies mix, belonging neither to the left nor to the right, receiving energy from the two divergences. There can also be instances of three, four, five, or six fetuses, which are treated in the same way. Others ask: What about a male who cannot become a father, or a female who cannot become a mother? How do we differentiate among those who possess characteristics of both genders? I say: A male cannot become a father due to a deficiency of阳 (yang) energy. A female cannot become a mother due to an obstruction of阴 (yin) energy. Those who embody characteristics of both genders are influenced by counteracting energies, resulting in an ambiguous form. For a female embodying male characteristics, there are two types: one encounters a male as a wife and a female as a husband; another can be a wife but not a husband. There is also the case where the lower part is female while the upper part possesses the full male form; this is an instance of significant divergence.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Some say: The irregular qi is primarily found in the yin aspect; does the form it creates differ from this? I reply: The yin body is empty, making it easy for the irregular qi to be present. The irregular qi&#39;s manifestation results from the mixing of yin and yang, having no principal source, and cannot be ascribed to either the left or the right. It receives qi from both sides and takes shape according to the lightness or heaviness of the irregular qi it bears; thus, the forms it embodies cannot be the same.</p>
<p>Yu Tuan said: The right, according to Danxi&#39;s discussion, delves into the subtle and profound, revealing what others have not. Therefore, it is understood that the distinction between man and woman is already established at the time when all things initially emerge from the primordial qi. At the moment when yin and yang intersect, those who are dim-witted fail to comprehend this principle and foolishly devise methods to change a female into a male, which is misguided. All things derive their beginnings from this primordial qi; is the distinction between man and woman not also derived from the primordial qi?</p>
<p>It is noted that if a woman wishes to determine the sex of her fetus after four months of pregnancy, the left pulse quickens for a boy, the right pulse for a girl, and if both quicken, it indicates twins. Furthermore, if a pregnant woman walks south and someone calls out from behind her, if she turns her head left, it indicates a boy; if she turns right, it indicates a girl. Similarly, when observing her behavior in labor, if someone calls out urgently from behind her, turning her head left indicates a boy, and turning right indicates a girl as well.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>On the right, Danxi says: A male is conceived in the left uterus, while a female is conceived in the right uterus. This statement is a great truth. The male fetus is on the left, thus the left is heavy; when turning the head, care is taken to protect the heavy side and thus it leans to the left. The female fetus is on the right, so the right is heavy; likewise, care is taken to protect the heavy side and it leans to the right. Applied to the pulse, the meaning is the same. If the fetus is on the left, the blood and qi protect the fetus and are abundant on the left, thus the pulse is strong on the left, indicating a male; a strong left pulse signifies a male. If the fetus is on the right, the blood and qi protect the fetus and are abundant on the right, so the pulse is strong on the right, indicating a female; a strong right pulse signifies a female. It is also as the classic says: the yin pulse is distinct from the yang pulse, indicating the presence of a child. The place of conception is below the navel, thus the blood and qi protect the fetus and are abundant below; that is why the yin pulse at the wrist is strong and distinct from the yang pulse at the inch. Similarly, if a sore or abscess arises above, the blood and qi surge from above and the inch pulse is strong; if it arises below, the blood and qi surge from below and the shichen pulse is strong; if it arises on the left, the blood and qi surge from the left and the left pulse is strong; if it arises on the right, the blood and qi surge from the right and the right pulse is strong. Danxi considers that a strong left pulse indicates a male and a strong right pulse indicates a female, serving as the physician&#39;s left and right hands, but this is one of the errors of the wise.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Extraordinary Efficacy of Fine Formulas</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Fang Xian)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On the Beginnings of Form and Substance in Conception</strong>  </p>
<p>In the beginning, there is the source of all qi, which heaven takes to regulate the qi. The primary origin is the source of all forms, which the earth takes to regulate the forms. Thus, the light and clear corresponds to heaven, receiving the vigorous and strong yang to stand above; the heavy and turbid corresponds to earth, accumulating the yielding and gentle yin to reside below. By responding to the virtues of the earth, transformation occurs, and by engaging with the principles of the heavens, management is undertaken. Therefore, heaven and earth mutually cause each other, generating and transforming life, rendering all things manifest. The <em>Yijing</em> states: &quot;Great is the primal source, all things begin from it.&quot; Thus, the yang influences and the yin transforms, blood and qi harmonize, and conception arises, also based on the principles of beginning and sustaining life.</p>
<p>At the onset of forming, the life gate is first established. The primal one generates water; ren is the yang water, which combines with ding&#39;s yin fire to produce bing, the life gate, and then the heart forms, the heart governs the blood vessels. Bing is the yang fire, which combines with xin&#39;s yin metal to produce geng; with the heart there is then the lung, which governs the skin and hair. Geng is the yang metal, which combines with yi&#39;s yin wood to produce jia; with the lung there is then the liver, which governs the tendons and nails. Jia is the yang wood, which combines with ji&#39;s yin earth to produce wu; with the liver there is then the spleen, which governs the muscles. Wu is the yang earth, which combines with gui&#39;s yin water to produce ren; with the spleen there is then the kidney, which governs the bone marrow.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The organs align with the Five Elements, based on their inherent characteristics, mutually restraining and generating one another. Furthermore, concerning the development of the embryo during pregnancy, this is something that can be substantiated by texts. The so-called &quot;pregnancy&quot; refers to the nourishment from the mother, which sustains the form; the nourishment from the mother, which sustains the essence. The growth of both air and flavor is fundamental; thus, the Five Energies of Heaven and the Five Flavors of Earth are consumed by the mother, and the fetus also feeds on them. Externally, they fill the physical body, and internally, they nourish the energy of the fetus, all of which depends on the sustenance of air and flavor. Now, the first nourishment of the fetus arises from the Jueyin. The &quot;Sacred Regulations&quot; states that the seasonal transformation begins with Wood. Investigating the nourishment from the twelve meridians, it initiates with the Liver. Thus, during the first month, blood coagulates, nourished by the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian. The Gallbladder is the organ of the Liver. In the second month, the embryonic sign emerges, nourished by the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian. In the third month, the Yang Spirit is harmonized as the Soul; Wood generates Fire, and the Hand Pericardium Meridian nourishes it. In the fourth month, the Yin Spirit manifests as the Corporeal Soul, nourished by the Hand Shaoyang Sanjiao Meridian. In the fifth month, the Five Elements are allocated to the Five Organs; Fire generates Earth, and the Foot Taiyin Spleen Meridian nourishes it. In the sixth month, the Six Laws establish the Six Bowels, nourished by the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian. In the seventh month, the Seven Emotions open the Seven Orifices to brightness; Earth generates Metal, and the Hand Taiyin Lung Meridian nourishes it.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>In the eighth month, the divine implements of the eight auspicious signs are prepared, nurturing the true spirit, supported by the Yangming Large Intestine Channel. In the ninth month, the rooms are adorned, establishing essence, nourished by the Shaoyin Kidney Channel. In the tenth month, the energy is sufficient, and all things take shape, nurtured by the Taiyang Bladder Channel. Starting from the liver, the organs nourish one another, each sustaining for thirty days; this is to feed on the mother to nurture its essence. Moreover, the Hand Taiyang Small Intestine Channel and Hand Shaoyin Heart Channel are not counted among the channels to be nurtured in the tenth month. In ordinary days, below is the monthly water; during gestation, above is the breast milk; thus, it does not nurture in the fetus. The embryo&#39;s initial signs begin, receiving the essence of water to form blood vessels, the essence of fire to form energy, the essence of metal to form tendons, the essence of wood to form bones, and the essence of earth to form skin, hide, and hair. When the five elements are complete, all the bones will be prepared; this is how the spirits of all things are gathered. If there are remarkable changes in fullness and depletion, strength and weakness of rigidity and softness, and the fluctuations of nourishment and defense, these are felt at the beginning of the essence&#39;s endowment. In the silent depths, those who are clear yield children who are wise and clever, long-lived, and healthy; those who are muddy produce dull and short-lived offspring. The key lies in restraining desires to preserve one&#39;s true nature; when yin and yang combine to conceive, the offspring will surely live long.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The essence governed by Yin ensures a person&#39;s longevity. In the past, there was a wife with many concubines but no children; she chose a good family with an unmarried girl of appropriate age, yet still had no children. When asked if there is a way to seek a son, Zhu Cheng said: For a couple to unite, they must be at the right age. Although a boy may be knowledgeable at sixteen, he must marry at thirty; though a girl may experience her first menstruation at fourteen, she should marry at twenty. Only when the energies of Yin and Yang are complete and substantial can they unite, leading to conception, nurturing, and the birth of strong and healthy children.</p>
<p>Now, for a girl who is yet to reach maturity, with her first menstruation just beginning, she is close to attracting male interest. If the Yin energy leaks prematurely before it is fully developed and substantial, this results in union but no conception, conception but no nurturing, and nurturing leading to fragile and short-lived children. This early pairing harms the balance of Yin and Yang, resulting in childlessness.</p>
<p>When a woman only gives birth to daughters, it is often due to excessive desire. Conversely, when all births are sons, this is due to the man refraining from excess. He could engage in the act one, three, or five days after the woman’s menstrual cycle, leading to a higher chance of conceiving a son at midnight. If intercourse occurs two, four, or six days after, the result will likely be daughters. If it happens beyond six days, the opportunity for conception fades. Thus, it is essential to understand and heed these principles.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Sayings on Infants at Birth</strong></p>
<p>A child, upon birth, inherits the dual forces of yin and yang, and afflictions arise from the three burners (sanjiao). It is easier to nurture the robust and mature, but difficult for the young and tender. Some say that those who cannot discern the young are thus categorized for separate care. Moreover, the physical form and longevity of a child depend entirely on essence and blood; when these two are harmonious, conception occurs, resulting in a birth after ten months in the mother&#39;s womb. Overall, life spans, fortune or misfortune, intelligence or ignorance, are all predetermined; how could one escape this fate?<br><strong>Secrets of Infant Nurturing by Wan Quan (Ming)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nurturing in the Womb to Preserve the True Nature</strong></p>
<p>The Treatise on Pregnant Children states: The utmost essence is transformed, and when the vital force condenses, it begins to receive the womb, gradually forming its physical shape. While in the womb, the child listens and perceives as the mother does. After conception, the mother must sit and act with propriety, maintain a peaceful disposition, and often stay in a tranquil room, listening to beautiful words. One should recite poetry and classics, explain rites and music, avoiding harmful speech and evil sights. By doing so, the offspring will generally be blessed with longevity, loyalty, filial piety, wisdom, and virtue. Otherwise, they may end up base, short-lived, and foolish—this is called being influenced externally and responding internally. In times past, Tai Ren, while carrying King Wen, did not listen to vile words, did not see ugly sights, nor spoke vile speech. This has become the traditional method of prenatal education. The three months of pregnancy are called the beginning of fetal development. During this time, blood does not circulate, the form begins to take shape, and there are no fixed patterns, which change upon seeing objects. It is important to maintain decorum and seriousness, allowing the mother to meet noble persons and avoiding those with ugly appearances.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>To conceive a boy, one should practice archery and ride a strong horse; to conceive a girl, one should wear earrings and adorn oneself with jewelry. If one desires a beautiful child, one should play with white jade and observe peacocks; if one desires a wise and capable child, one should read poetry and prose, and strive for harmony and elegance. I have seen common women during pregnancy, engaging in activities like moving puppets, dressing idols, and performance arts, and those who later bore children often resembled those figures.</p>
<p>There are methods for nurturing the fetus, and there are also ways to transform a girl into a boy, all governed by natural principles. For instance, eating rooster (a male chicken) gathers the masculine essence from the heavens; wearing realgar (a mineral containing arsenic) absorbs the male energy from the earth; practicing archery and wielding axes draws upon the visibility of masculine elements in human actions. The corresponding energies are intimately connected, and the secrets of creation indicate that before the three-month mark when forms begin to take shape, the influence of yang (masculine) can overcome yin (feminine), thus transforming a girl into a boy, and this is indeed a natural principle.</p>
<p>Heaven has five energies, each with its affinities; the earth has five flavors, each with its balanced inputs. Each gathering has its proper timing, and each input has its measurements. All that one fears or avoids should be treated with caution; nurturing through the resources of nature is an inherent principle. Additionally, one should regulate their emotions and desires, limit excessive indulgences, and labor diligently but thoughtfully, and then the vital energies and blood will follow suit.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>All these measures are aimed at protecting and maintaining pregnancy, preventing any disturbances from external causes. If this is not the case, when one receives the essence of life at the moment of conception and fails to maintain proper nourishment, internally one becomes insufficient in maintaining balance, and externally too weak to support the body, leading to diseases due to inadequate energy and vitality. Just as when eating a rabbit one can be left without lips, or when eating a dog one may find no sound, and when eating mixed fish one may suffer from conditions like scabies—these are all due to a lack of caution in dietary habits. </p>
<p>Great astonishment of the heart can lead to manic conditions, insufficient kidney energy can cause headaches, disharmony of the spleen and stomach can lead to weakness, and weakness of the heart energy can cause a lack of spirit; all these issues arise from an imbalance of Qi and blood. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is from this principle that nurturing begins. A child in the mother’s womb draws upon the energy from the mother’s five organs for sustenance. If any of these organs is injured, the energy from that organ becomes depleted and insufficient. For instance, wind can harm the liver, heat can damage the heart and lungs, dampness can injure the spleen, and cold can affect the kidneys—these are injuries inflicted by the four seasonal energies of heaven. </p>
<p>Excessive sourness can harm the liver, excessive bitterness can damage the heart, excessive sweetness can affect the spleen, excessive pungency can injure the lungs, and excessive saltiness can hurt the kidneys—these are injuries caused by the five flavors of the earth.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Anger harms the liver, joy harms the heart, thoughtfulness harms the spleen, worry harms the lungs, and fear harms the kidneys; these are the injuries caused by the seven emotions in a person. Therefore, one should avoid wind, cold, heat, and dampness; limit the five flavors of food; and eliminate the influence of the seven emotions—this is the way to nurture the fetus. Regarding not climbing high, not approaching danger, not being alone in a dark room, not entering temples or altars, not indulging in rich foods, not consuming melons and fruits, and not engaging in forbidden activities—each aspect of care has its own principles. If one is unable to conceive or if they are excessively arrogant, such actions will surely lead to trouble. </p>
<p>During pregnancy, if one is ill, one should not recklessly take medication. It is essential for a physician to carefully assess the severity of the illness, the nature of the medicine, and apply a moderate approach without excessive variety. If the illness is seen to be waning, it is proper to stop the medication, thus the illness will leave the mother, and the child will not be lost. Generally, if a pregnant woman is without illness, she should not take medicine. If there is illness, the primary focus should be on harmonizing the fetus; if it is a minor ailment, one should not overuse medicine. Therefore, for a pregnant woman’s illness, the Chai Hu harmonizing the fetus decoction should be used.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Medicine</strong><br><strong>By: Yu Tuan (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Infants</strong></p>
<p>It is said that the field of pediatric medicine, which the ancients referred to as the &quot;silent illness,&quot; is the most challenging to treat. This saying is indeed true! Infants present a difficulty in diagnosis because it is hard to inquire about symptoms or assess the pulse. In addition, their organs are delicate, and the use of strong or extreme cold and heat medicines should not be taken lightly. </p>
<p>Let us discuss this in detail: An infant who is still in swaddling has no internal conflicts of emotions and desires, and is not subjected to the ravages of extreme wind or cold. What serious and numerous illnesses could they possibly have in such conditions? If we examine the symptoms, most are due to fetal toxins, and a minor proportion are caused by food injuries. As for external signs of wind and cold, they are rather rare.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>It is said: changes in steaming, pox, mottling and rotting, anxiety and fright, wind convulsions, seizures, phlegm obstruction, red tumors, white baldness, relief from cranial pressure, heavy tongue and wood tongue—these various symptoms, are they not caused by the mother&#39;s negligence of the fetal poison? When a child is in the womb, if the mother is hungry, the child is hungry; if the mother is full, the child is full. Spicy foods suit the taste, the fetal energy follows the heat, emotions stir within, and the fetal breath becomes restless. Whether there is excessive consumption of fried foods or indulgence in spicy and sour flavors, or unrestrained desires, or fluctuating emotions, all can cause afflictions to the child. The ancients spoke wisely when they said that women in pregnancy should not lie sideways, sit carelessly, stand unceremoniously, or eat improper foods. Their words are profound! The principles of diet and nurturing for both males and females during pregnancy must deeply align with the essence of nature&#39;s continuous life. Therefore, the ancients often enjoyed longevity, while few children faced early death; this is the reason. I have observed in modern times that some women with gentle and mild dispositions, who do not indulge in uncontrolled desires during pregnancy, give birth to children with few illnesses and rare pox; they can serve as models for others.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Broad Discussions on Principles</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Guo Zizhang]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Before Birth</strong>  </p>
<p>Cai said: When a child is in the mother&#39;s womb, if the mother is unaware of restrictions, she may indulge in spicy foods or give in to lustful desires. This can accumulate toxins and flow into the child&#39;s meridians, which later manifest as sores, pustules, or rashes. This is the source of such ailments. The &quot;Illustrated Manual&quot; states: An infant in the womb receives the essence of yin, yang, and the five elements, which gives rise to its organs and bodily structure. Although the form is present, the flesh is not yet solid, and the bones are not yet formed. With sufficient yang energy but insufficient yin blood, one should not overindulge in warmth to diminish the yin; this is a major admonishment from Master Danxi. However, while in the womb, the child must rely on the mother&#39;s qi and blood for nourishment. Thus, if the mother is hot, the child is hot; if the mother is cold, the child is cold; if the mother is startled, the child is startled; if the mother is weak, the child is weak. This leads to symptoms of fetal heat, cold, shock, and weakness. The Xin&#39;an Prescription states: The source of sores and rashes is primarily due to the mother&#39;s dietary practices during pregnancy—eating fried, roasted, or overly rich foods and alcohol. The child, immersed in the mother&#39;s impure blood, accumulates toxins lodged within the five organs.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>After birth, one may suffer from external influences such as wind and cold, internal harm from excessive cold, falls, fright, seasonal epidemics, or emotional disturbances, which can ignite internal heat. This may manifest on the skin: heart poison appears as spots, lung poison as rashes, liver poison as blisters, and spleen poison as pus-filled sores. Infants, being endowed with relatively robust health and balanced qi and blood, are more susceptible to these issues. However, if they are weak and toxic tendencies prevail, and both internal and external conditions are deficient with weak qi and blood, medical intervention is essential for survival.</p>
<p>I humbly suggest that the discussions among you reflect the ancient teachings on prenatal education. Among the ailments affecting infants, variola and rashes are particularly severe, and when parents suffer from these, who does not mourn? Yet those who are wise accept their fate, while the foolish are more distressed, creating their own misfortunes—who then can understand this? The young girls, who cannot read or discern, place blame on their fathers. The father recites teachings for the mother, while she nurtures and trains the child, hoping to cultivate a pure foundation for the future. I have heard that when a woman is pregnant, she should sleep separately, have a light diet, and be cautious with her senses, to ensure the child is upright, wise, strong, and healthy, thus mitigating any prenatal toxins and the severity of childhood diseases. Therefore, instead of lamenting later, it is far better to be meticulous at the outset.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>On the Many Illnesses of Children Born to Pregnant Women Who Do Not Observe Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, the methods of nurturing pregnancy and teaching fetal development were taken very seriously. As a result, people in ancient times lived long lives and possessed great virtues, and there was a good reason for that. In today&#39;s world, women who are pregnant can follow the principles laid out in the &quot;Biographies of Exemplary Women,&quot; which emphasize the importance of maintaining a light diet, moderating hunger and satiety, thus ensuring that the pregnancy is marked by a clear qi (vital energy) and no illness. This leads to an easier labor and fewer ailments in the child, with occurrences of diseases like smallpox being rare. This can be seen as a result of the harmonious circulation of qi and blood.</p>
<p>However, in later generations, customs have gradually become lax, and few people are able to grasp these truths. Both men and women indulge their desires, often without restraint. During pregnancy, they pay little heed to these principles, which leads to discord in their qi and blood at the time of labor, resulting in panic and convulsions during childbirth. This is due to the fetus being affected by toxins, planting the seeds of deep-seated illnesses, such that even the best doctors and remedies are unable to help.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan)</p>
<p><strong>Taboos Regarding Abortion</strong></p>
<p>Whenever there is an abortion, adjustments should not be made. Even if there is movement nearby, a pregnant woman should avoid it. Even if the pregnancy does not end in miscarriage, it may lead to deformity in the child. If the color is blue and the body is convulsed, it may result in an early death.</p>
<p><strong>Directions for Giving Birth</strong></p>
<p>For children born on the days of Zi (Rat), Wu (Horse), Yin (Tiger), and You (Rooster), the suitable direction is southwest. For those born on Yin (Tiger), Shen (Monkey), Si (Snake), and Hai (Pig) days, it is northwest. For those born on Chen (Dragon), Xu (Dog), and Wei (Goat) days, it is southeast.</p>

<p>The above nineteen ingredients should be ground into powder, mixed with honey, and formed into pills the size of a walnut. Take ten pills with wine twice a day, gradually increasing to twenty pills.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Chai Hu and Tai Yin (From &quot;Secret of Infant Care&quot;)</strong><br>To treat diseases in pregnant women, this prescription should be the main approach, as it does not harm the child.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Chai Hu  </li>
<li>Huang Qin (preferably firm and heavy as if submerged in water)  </li>
<li>Bai Zhu (preferably without oil)  </li>

<p><strong>Single Recipe</strong></p>
<p>To change a girl to a boy: Take ten original silkworm droppings and consume them with well water, three times daily.<br>Also, take one bowstring and place it in a crimson pouch on the woman&#39;s left arm. Bind it around the waist, and remove it after a hundred days.<br>Next, take one ounce of realgar and place it in a crimson pouch on the left side of the waist. For those desiring a girl, place orpiment on the right side of the waist.<br>Additionally, place an axe under the bed of the woman in labor, with the blade facing down, and keep it hidden. If doubted, wait for a hen to sit on eggs, and place the axe under the nest; all the chicks will be male.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The Hemerocallis is also known as &quot;suitable for men&quot;; pregnant women wear it. </p>
<p>A rooster with a long tail should have its three stalks placed under the pregnant woman&#39;s bed, and she must not be allowed to know this. </p>
<p>Take hair and nail clippings from the husband and spread them beneath the pregnant woman&#39;s bed; she must also not be told. </p>
<p>According to medical case studies:</p>
<p>The &quot;Biographies of Exemplary Women&quot; states: Tai Ren, the mother of King Wen, was the second daughter of the Zhen Ren family. King Ji took her as his consort. Tai Ren&#39;s nature was proper, sincere, and solemn, solely focused on moral conduct. During her pregnancy with King Wen, she avoided looking at bad sights, listening to lewd sounds, and speaking impolitely. After giving birth to King Wen, who became enlightened and wise, Tai Ren taught him to recognize one thing and know a hundred, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Zhou dynasty. Scholars commend Tai Ren for her ability in prenatal education.</p>
<p>Li Dongyuan said: Li Shuhe inquired: Since the year of Shen, after obtaining a son, once he turned one, he developed red thread-like tumors all over his body, which were untreatable. Subsequently, he had four more sons, and both the first and second ones died from similar tumors. What could be the reason for this? The next day I visited and explained: You are carrying hidden fire in your kidneys, and the essence and energy contain an excess of red threads; this is passed down, causing the child to suffer this illness, commonly known as a fetal tumor. You should observe this; it was indeed as I said. So, I prescribed kidney-replenishing pills to dispel the fire within the kidneys and to replenish the inadequate true yin. Avoid alcohol, vinegar, pungent, and hot foods. His wife took Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills to nourish yin and blood. After five months of pregnancy, use Huang Qin and Bai Zhu to make a powder and take it five or seven times. Subsequently, he successfully had three more sons, and the previous symptoms did not recur.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Theory of Prenatal Education</h3>
<p>In ancient times, when a woman was pregnant, she should not lie on her side, sit at an angle, or stand without a support. She should avoid bad tastes in her food, refrain from eating improperly cut food, and should not sit on a misaligned seat. She should avert her gaze from improper sights and close her ears to lewd sounds. At night, she should have a blind person recite poetry and discuss proper matters, so that her child will be born with a proper appearance and surpass others in talent.</p>
<h3>Theory of Nurturing the Fetus</h3>
<p>It is an old saying that during the first three months of conception, the fetus undergoes various changes, and its qualities are not yet determined. Therefore, during these three months, if one wishes to witness rare natural phenomena, fierce beasts, precious jewels, or fine materials, or desires to see virtuous gentlemen with great moral character, one should observe ceremonial music and military arrangements, burn fragrant incenses, and orally recite poetry and ancient maxims. Living and dwelling in a tranquil environment, avoiding improperly cut food and misaligned seating, playing the guqin, and adjusting the mind and feelings are important; moderation in desires and maintaining purity in all matters will result in a good child who will live long, be loyal, filial, benevolent, righteous, wise, and free of ailments. This is the essence of King Wen&#39;s prenatal education.</p>
<p>While a child is in the womb, the lunar and solar cycles are not yet complete, the yin and yang are not balanced, and the organs, bones, and joints have not fully formed. Thus, from the beginning of pregnancy until childbirth, there are various dietary prohibitions.</p>
<p>Eating lamb liver during pregnancy can result in a difficult child; eating goat meat can lead to frequent illnesses. Eating donkey or horse meat can prolong the child&#39;s gestation; eating mule meat can make childbirth difficult. Eating rabbit or dog meat can result in a child born mute or with a cleft lip. Eating chicken or glutinous rice can lead to the child having many white worms.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a woman is pregnant and eats chicken eggs and dried carp, her child will have many sores.<br>If she eats mulberries and duck, her child will be born with a cold heart.<br>If she eats sparrow meat and soybean paste, her child will have a darkened face filled with spots.<br>If she eats sparrow meat and drinks alcohol, her child will be lustful and emotionally chaotic, lacking a sense of shame.<br>If she eats turtle, her child will have a short neck.<br>If she consumes ice and frost, it will result in miscarriage.<br>During pregnancy, she should not urinate in unusual places, as it may lead to the death of the child.<br>Moreover, it is said: The third month of pregnancy is called the beginning of the fetus; at this time, the shape is not yet established, and it changes according to what it sees. To conceive a boy, one should handle bows and arrows; to conceive a girl, one should play with pearls and jewels. If one desires a beautiful child, one should often gaze at jade; if one desires a virtuous child, one should sit upright in a tranquil state. This is called external appearance impacting internal feelings.  </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Prenatal Education</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;On the Sources of Illness&quot; by the Chao Clan: In the first month of pregnancy, it is called the embryo, nurtured by the Foot Jueyin meridian; in the second month, it is called the initial essence, nurtured by the Foot Shaoyang meridian; in the third month, it is called the initial fetus, nurtured by the Hand Shenzong meridian. At this time, blood does not circulate, and forms start to take shape, without fixed features, thus subject to change due to external influences. To ensure the child is upright and dignified, one should often speak of proper words and act in accordance with virtuous deeds. If desiring a son, one should wear string and hold bow and arrows; if wanting a daughter, one should wear a belt and adorn with pendants. To have a beautiful child, one should wear white jade; to have an able and wise child, one should read poetry and books. This is known as the external appearance that inwardly influences. In the fourth month, the essence of water begins to form the blood vessels, nurtured by the Hand Shaoyang meridian; in the fifth month, the essence of fire begins to form the qi, nurtured by the Foot Taiyin meridian; in the sixth month, the essence of metal begins to form the muscles, nurtured by the Foot Yangming meridian; in the seventh month, the essence of wood begins to form the bones, nurtured by the Hand Taiyin meridian; in the eighth month, the essence of earth begins to form the skin, nurtured by the Hand Yangming meridian; in the ninth month, the essence of stone begins to form the hair, nurtured by the Foot Shaoyin meridian; by the tenth month, the five organs, six bowels, joints, and spirit are all complete. This summarizes the general principles. Additionally, there is a discussion from the theory on the five organs that describes the development: In the first month, like a dewdrop; in the second month, like a peach blossom; in the third month, distinctions between male and female; in the fourth month, the form is complete; in the fifth month, muscles and bones are formed; in the sixth month, hair begins to grow; in the seventh month, the soul can wander, and the child can move its left hand; in the eighth month, the spirit can wander, and the child can move its right hand; in the ninth month, it can turn three times; in the tenth month, it receives complete essence.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, the &quot;Lú Huān Jīng&quot; states: In the first month, the fetus is formed from the coagulation of essence and blood; in the second month, the fetal shape is established, and the embryo is formed; in the third month, the yang spirit corresponds to the three souls; in the fourth month, the yin spirit corresponds to the seven corporeal souls; in the fifth month, the five elements correspond to the five organs; in the sixth month, the six laws establish the six entrails; in the seventh month, the essence opens the orifices to connect with brightness; in the eighth month, the original spirit possesses the true spirit; in the ninth month, the palace is adorned to define the birth of a person; in the tenth month, upon receiving sufficient qi, all manifestations are complete. </p>
<p>Now, upon examining these numerical statements: those who speak of the five organs, for example, are merely shallow and ludicrous, falsely attaching their names; as for the three collections of Buddhist texts, they delve into the bizarre and are hard to verify. According to the three volumes of the &quot;Lú Huān Jīng,&quot; written by ancient magicians, certain thoughts on pregnancy assert that the fetus begins to take shape after three months. If one wishes to discuss correct words, conduct proper actions, wear cords of leather, handle bows and arrows, adorn with rings, don white jade, and read poetry and texts, could this not align with the principles of prenatal education? Let us consider what the Nesting Clan discussed, stating the principles of nurturing during pregnancy.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If considering the liver meridian of the foot&#39;s Jueyin, and the gallbladder meridian of the foot&#39;s Shaoyang, they are part of one organ&#39;s channel, and the rest are similar. Moreover, the regulations of the four seasons must begin with the spring wood; hence, the nourishment of the twelve channels begins with the liver, which is why fetal nourishment occurs in the first and second months. The hand&#39;s heart protector meridian and the hand&#39;s Shaoyang Sanjiao meridian correspond to fire and are strong in summer, which is why nourishment for the fetus occurs in the third and fourth months. The hand&#39;s Taiyin and hand&#39;s Yangming are the heart meridians; being the officials of the sovereign, they are elevated without action. The foot&#39;s Taiyin spleen meridian and the foot&#39;s Yangming stomach meridian belong to earth and thrive in late summer, which is why fetal nourishment occurs in the fifth and sixth months. The hand&#39;s Taiyin lung meridian and the hand&#39;s Yangming large intestine meridian belong to metal and are strong in autumn, hence, fetal nourishment occurs in the seventh and eighth months. The foot&#39;s Shaoyin kidney meridian belongs to water and is strong in winter, so fetal nourishment takes place in the ninth month. Furthermore, the mother&#39;s kidneys are connected to the fetus, as they contain the mother&#39;s true qi, on which the child depends. By the tenth month, the child is nourished in the mother’s womb by the qi of all the organs and channels, awaiting the right time to be born. This discussion is profound and contains utmost principles. There are those in the world who are even more enlightened, but none surpass the theories of the Nestorian.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Due to the movement of energy, if it moves to the left, it belongs to Yang, and when Yang is nourished, it becomes male; if it moves to the right, it belongs to Yin, and when Yin is nourished, it becomes female. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states that the path of the dry leads to the creation of males, while the path of the receptive leads to the creation of females; this is the distinction between men and women. </p>
<p>In cases of pregnancy with complications, administering decoctions will reduce symptoms by more than half, allowing the illness to pass and the mother to be at peace, so the fetus remains unharmed. </p>
<p>According to Dongyuan and Danxi: when the menstrual flow ceases for one or two days, the blood ceases its flow, and if the essence prevails over the blood, the result is male; after four or five days, the blood vessels become strong, and if the essence cannot prevail over the blood, the result is female. This is due to the interaction of paternal essence and maternal blood. When the essence is applied, the blood can capture the essence, hence resulting in a male; this is how all things begin from the creative principles of Yang. When the blood flows, the essence cannot capture it, hence resulting in a female; this signifies that all things are born from the receptive principles of Yin. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the essence overcomes the blood, then the yang becomes the master, receiving energy from the left uterus, resulting in the formation of a male; if the essence does not overcome the blood, then the yin becomes the master, receiving energy from the right uterus, resulting in the formation of a female. This is a definitive theory regarding the matters of conception. As for the medications for pregnancy, they should be restricted, and one should refer to this domain for further examination. </p>
<p>According to the Chu family, the union of male and female involves mutual affection. The yin blood arrives first, followed by the yang essence; the blood envelops the essence, which then enters the bones, resulting in the formation of a male. Conversely, if the yang essence enters first and the yin blood follows, it envelops the blood, which then becomes the foundation, resulting in a female. The yang energy gathers in the front, thus men have a heavier face; those who die from drowning must face down. The yin energy gathers in the back, hence women have a heavier back; those who drown must lie on their backs. This is true for both wild animals, regardless of how they die. When yin and yang are equally present, it is neither male nor female; when essence and blood are scattered, it foretells the signs of twin births. If the father is young and the mother is old, a female offspring will surely be weak; if the mother is strong and the father is weak, a male offspring will surely be frail.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Ma Yiqing argues that books on prenatal education and childbirth should not be dismissed as too antiquated to be credible, yet they should not be treated carelessly. Nowadays, families of common customs and improper practices may neglect proper precautions and rituals. Sometimes they suffer from poisons that cannot be expelled or give birth under adverse conditions, yet there are some fortunate enough to have healthy mothers and children. If one wishes to protect pregnancy, one must nurture in many ways to avoid future troubles. Just as if a neighbor undertakes construction, it may disturb the fetal energy, causing the child to be deformed or perish. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Chapter on the Root of the Universe</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, there was the Great Primal (Tai Chu) and the Great Beginning (Tai Shi). When chaos was first distinguished, the vital essence was seen; hence it is called the Great Primal. When forms were established, it is then termed the Great Beginning. As essence first takes shape and forms begin, heaven and earth mutually originate, generating and transforming endlessly, the myriad things become manifest. Thus it is said, &quot;Great indeed is the origin of Heaven, for it is the source of all things; profound indeed is the origin of the Earth, for it is the source of all life.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: Wu Yu&#39;s commentary states that before chaos was distinguished, essence and form were both non-existent; once chaos was distinguished, essence and form were separate. The sighting of essence is the Great Primal; the establishment of forms is the Great Beginning. The Great Primal is the root of all that has essence; therefore, heaven obtains it to govern the primal essence. The Great Beginning is the root of all that has form; therefore, the earth gains it to govern the primal form. When heaven and earth interact harmoniously, they are mutually caused by essence and form; that which generates life does so, and that which transforms is able to transform, while the myriad things move and their shapes, colors, and names are all made clear. Considered great is the origin of Heaven, where the Great Primal resides, hence the reference to it as the source of all things. Considered profound is the origin of the Earth, where the Great Beginning resides, hence the reference to it as the source of all life. Truly, all things derive their genesis and sustenance from Heaven and Earth; thus, the origin of Heaven brings forth omens, while the origin of Earth ensures all forms come into being.)<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At the beginning of existence, although the Yang is in its proper form, it is the Yin that serves as the master as it nurtures and fulfills. </p>
<p>As stated in Xue&#39;s Commentary on the Theory of Yin and Yang: Heaven covers, and Earth supports; all things are born. That which has not yet emerged from the Earth is termed Yin and is named the Yin within Yin; that which has emerged is termed Yang and is named the Yin within Yang. The Yang is in its proper form, while the Yin is the master. According to Wang Bing, the Yang imparts upright energy, allowing all things to be born; the Yin, being the master, allows various forms to manifest. The &quot;Character Explanations&quot; states: The initiator of life is Heaven and Earth; the nurturer is humanity.</p>
<p>As forms change and shift, day transforms into night, and the way of the Earth ultimately concludes. </p>
<p>As noted in the &quot;Liezi,&quot; in the Zhou Mu chapter, Master Yin Wen states: The transformation of forms is called change. In the &quot;Zhuangzi,&quot; the chapter on Tian Zifang says: The alternation of fullness and emptiness, one dark and one bright; day transforms into night, and each has its role, yet the results are often unseen. The text of the Earth Hexagram in the &quot;I Ching&quot; says: The way of Earth has no permanence but does have an end. The Earth bears Heaven, existing without permanence but having an end; is it forced by circumstances? The source of the way lies where, if living things are deprived of it, they die; if they have it, they live. In this, all beings heed its command. Thus, it is said that there is no permanence, yet an end exists—this is the teaching of the way.</p>
<p>This state is termed pregnancy; once the Yang has been received, the Yin commences it.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the chapter of Heaven and Earth from the &quot;Zhuangzi,&quot; it says: Life flows and gives birth to all things. The principles of creation are termed forms. The preservation of spirit within each form, each having its own characteristics, is called nature. Those who are ignorant do not understand this; they desire to go against the principles of nature and mistakenly seek methods of cessation, thus applying the concept of life and death to the five elements and seeking nourishment in herbs and stones, attempting to conquer reality with falsehood and human effort against the will of heaven. Although some may conceive, many become pregnant but do not give birth, and among those who do give birth, many do not live long. </p>
<p>In ancient discussions on aging and having children, it was stated that for men this would not extend beyond the age of eighty-eight and for women, not beyond seventy-seven, thus revealing that the vital essence within a person is inherently limited. Could one truly escape the fixed principles of yin and yang? </p>
<p>In the discourse on nature, the Emperor asks: What about those who are older yet still have children? Qi Bo replies: This occurs when their heavenly lifespan is excessive, their vital energy is regularly flowing, and their kidney energy is abundant. Although such individuals may have children, men will not exceed the age of eighty-eight and women will not exceed seventy-seven, after which the essence of heaven and earth is depleted.</p>
<p>(Note: Even though one may produce children in old age, the lifespan of these children cannot exceed the heavenly limit.)<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Distinct Forms and Vital Energies</strong></p>
<p>Heaven and Earth are the grand expressions of form. Yin and Yang are the great manifestations of energy. Only form and energy rely on each other to stand; neither has ever been neglected.</p>
<p>Men and women mingle their essences, and all things are transformed and born; the forms and energies of Heaven, Earth, Yin, and Yang are contained within this.</p>
<p>When we speak of the numbers seven and eight: seven represents lesser Yang, while eight embodies lesser Yin. They resonate and flow together, hence when a woman reaches her second cycle of seven years and her vital essence appears, and a man reaches the second cycle of eight years, achieving harmony in essence, it is through the union of Yin and Yang that new beginnings are signified.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: A girl at fourteen has the way of becoming a mother; at forty-nine, she ends her ability to bear children. A boy at sixteen has the way of becoming a father; at sixty-four, he loses his ability for fatherhood. The number ninety corresponds to the ninth elder, who represents yang, while the tenth elder represents yin. They encompass each other, thus form is generated. Consequently, yin culminates in ten, which men can encircle, while yang culminates in nine, which women can square. This interdependence of yin and yang results in the completion of life.</p>
<p>Commentary: &quot;Zi Shuo&quot; states: Yin culminates in ten, men encircle it; yang culminates in nine, women square it. Nine has transformative potential, so women can square it. Ten has no transformations, so men can encircle it. Explanation: Men have homes to encircle the yin externally; women have households to contain the yang internally. The &quot;I Ching&quot; says: The fortune of a woman corresponds to unity and completion. The doctrine of the husband is defined by misfortune for the woman. Circles symbolize encirclement, representing the way of the ruler and of the husband. A circle allows for the systematization of principles in action. Squares symbolize benevolence, representing the way of subjects and of wives. A square represents pure unity. Men follow the circle, aligning with their principles; women adhere to benevolence, aligning with their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Vital energy flourishes and is nurtured, all beginning with the child. Following from the child: the boy moves leftward in three decades and reaches maturity; the girl moves rightward in two decades and reaches maturity. The mature stage corresponds with the correct yang, from which yin genuinely follows. From this mature stage, pregnancy begins: the boy rotates leftward for ten months and is born in the year of the tiger; the girl rotates rightward for ten months and is born in the year of the monkey.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Shen corresponds to the three Yin, and the Yin corresponds to the three Yang, which signifies the time of birth and reproduction. In its allocations, there are elements of hardness and softness, strength and weakness in the pulse, abundance and scarcity in the energy (Qi), and flourishing and declining in the blood; all these are determined and unchanging.</p>
<p>(Note: The text mentions that men born in the Yin (寅) belong to wood and are Yang, while women born in the Shen (申) belong to metal and are Yin. According to Yang’s commentary, the primal energy arises in the Zi, where humans are born. Men move left from Zi by thirty, while women move right by twenty, both arriving at the Yi, representing husband and wife conceiving. In ancient times, men married at thirty and women at twenty. A ten-month gestation results in men being born from the Si, moving left to Yin for ten months, and women from the Si, moving right to Shen for ten months.)</p>
<p>As for different regions and environments, the yields are appropriate to their quantities; auspicious events bring favorable omens, and dreams align with their kinds. Hence, in places like Jing and Yang with thin soil, there are more daughters; in Yong and Ji with rich soil, there are more sons. The bear and tiger are auspicious signs for males, while snakes and vipers are auspicious signs for females.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note</strong>: The &quot;Zhouguan Zhi&quot; states that in Yangzhou, there are three males and five females among the people; in Jingzhou, one male and two females; in Yongzhou, three males and three females; and in Jizhou, five males and three females. From the &quot;Shijing,&quot; the poem &quot;Si Gan&quot;: What does a good dream signify? It signifies bears and tigers, serpents and snakes; great men interpret these. Bears and tigers signify auspiciousness for males, while serpents and snakes signify auspiciousness for females. </p>
<p>The method of fetal transformation includes what is said about turning females into males, which is all natural. For example, eating a male rooster extracts yang essence from what is obtained from heaven; using realgar, one extracts yang essence from the earth. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: From &quot;Qianjin Fang&quot;: To transform a female into a male, one can use Dan Shen pills made with the head of a male rooster from Dongmen. Another recipe: take one tael of realgar and enclose it in a crimson pouch. From &quot;Bencao&quot;: The male rooster replenishes the weak and warms the center, opens the mind, and kills toxins; it nourishes the liver and replenishes the kidneys, and its comb enriches yang. Realgar, when worn, wards off spirits and cannot be harmed by toxins. </p>
<p>Drawing the bow and arrows, using axes and chisels, refers to employing hard materials in human affairs; the essence of these things subtly connects, and creation transforms discreetly, signaling the form before the third month. Essentially, when the form is not yet fully manifested, yang can conquer yin, and it is indeed reasonable to transform a female into a male. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Nest Scholar&#39;s theory states: pregnancy begins in the third month when the fetus starts taking shape. The form has not yet been fixed, and manifesting depends on changes in what is perceived. To seek a male, one should draw bows and arrows and eat a male rooster.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>The nature of heaven and earth is endowed with qualities; the essence of all things gathers their spiritual energy. Yin and Yang are balanced, and Qi and essence are complete, thus forming their shapes. However, there are peculiar pairs and different numbers, leading to growth and decline; the rigidity and flexibility are used differently, sometimes strong, sometimes weak. The blood nourishes, and Qi envelops; they cannot escape the principles of fullness and emptiness. Therefore, regarding one&#39;s innate qualities, can they be generalized? Thus, those with appendages, unusual fingers, or dwarfed and limping forms have their shapes and Qi determined as such. Conditions like sores, swellings, deafness, blindness, muteness, emaciation, and fatigue are all diseases of Qi and form. Nevertheless, at the beginning of embryonic formation, after the essence transforms into Qi, the protection and support are certainly part of the way. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heaven has five vital energies, each harmonizing with its own; earth has five flavors, each nourishing its own. The harmonization has its timing, and the nourishment has its measures. All that is to be feared and avoided should be thoroughly understood and cautiously regarded. The resources for sustenance are thus, naturally. Therefore, rest and activity should align with the times, and comings and goings should adhere to moderation.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Sixteen Classes of Hidden Symbols,&quot; it is said that heaven nourishes humans with five vital energies, and earth nourishes humans with five flavors. Wang Bing states: Heaven nourishes people with the five energies where the sour energy corresponds to the liver, the bitter energy corresponds to the heart, the sweet energy corresponds to the spleen, the pungent energy corresponds to the lungs, and the salty energy corresponds to the kidneys. </p>
<p>The five flavors from the earth enter as follows: sour enters the liver, bitter enters the heart, sweet enters the spleen, pungent enters the lungs, and salty enters the kidneys. It is possible to be insightful and meticulous, ensuring that fog, dew, windy disturbances do not intrude, and thus the nourishment should follow the natural order of timing. Hence, it is necessary to regulate joy and anger, and to reduce excessive desires.</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of pregnancy, one must carefully avoid the harm of miscarriage during the prenatal period. </p>
<p>Once conception occurs, one should diligently avoid anything that might harm the fetus.

<p>When the spirit is within the house, it is not advisable to arrange beds or hang canopies at certain positions, nor is it appropriate to sweep the house, as this is ominous. Additionally, there are prohibitions related to killing young children, the inherent risks of the current year, and not harming the mother during childbirth. All pregnant women should display this in their homes and ensure they see it regularly. It is crucial to avoid digging, relocating, hammering fences, and the like. Violating these prohibitions could lead to severe consequences such as loss of the fetus or harm to the mother; if not severe, the child may be deformed or suffer disabilities. Such violations cause dire outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>After conception, there are many foods that should be avoided not only for the sake of the fetus&#39;s well-being but also for physical properties that should be heeded. If one cannot adhere to these restrictions, there will not only be delays in labor but also risks to the child&#39;s development and the mother&#39;s health.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Fetal Education</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, prenatal teaching was detailed in various texts, and there is no need for me to elaborate. However, regarding diseases during pregnancy, it is often vague and unclear, as many overlook its significance, and physicians do not always understand it. A child in the womb shares the mother’s body; if she is warm, the child is warm; if cold, so is the child; if she is sick, the child is sick; if well, the child is well. Therefore, the mother’s diet and daily activities must be particularly cautious, as ignorance could lead to trouble.</p>
<p><strong>On Fetal Perception</strong></p>
<p>The discussion about the differentiation of sexes after conception, based on essence and blood, is from the argument of Chu Cheng. I find it quite perplexing. Later, I read Li Dongyuan&#39;s theory which states: if menstruation ceases one or two days later, and the blood sea begins to clear, the essence dominates the blood, resulting in a male; but if it is four to five days later, and the blood vessels are robust, the essence cannot overcome the blood, resulting in a female. This theory, however, remains unclarified. Why do I say this? The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: the dry principle produces males, and the moist principle produces females. The concepts of dry and moist refer to the nature of yin and yang. Left and right represent the pathways of yin and yang. Males and females are the symbols of yin and yang. The father’s essence and mother’s blood converge through perception. The release of essence is the expression of yang. Blood can contain it, representing the transformation of yin. The essence forms the bones; this marks the beginning of all things from the dry source. Blood forms the womb; this nourishes all things from the moist source. When yin and yang intersect, conception occurs. The place where the fetus resides is called the uterus. It is connected below, with two branches above reaching left and right. When the essence dominates the blood and is stimulated during the active period of the sun, it is thus male that is formed, receiving qi from the left side of the uterus.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the essence is insufficient to outweigh the blood, and during the times influenced by soft sunlight and阴 (yin), then the阴 (yin) becomes the dominant force, receiving energy from the right ovary, thus forming a female. Some ask: If there is division between male and female, what happens to twins? It is said: When the essence is plentiful, it diverges and splits, and the blood follows this division. As for simultaneous pregnancies of both male and female, during the strong sunlight of the day or the soft sunlight of the yin, when influenced, the energies mix, belonging neither to the left nor to the right, receiving energy from the two divergences. There can also be instances of three, four, five, or six fetuses, which are treated in the same way. Others ask: What about a male who cannot become a father, or a female who cannot become a mother? How do we differentiate among those who possess characteristics of both genders? I say: A male cannot become a father due to a deficiency of阳 (yang) energy. A female cannot become a mother due to an obstruction of阴 (yin) energy. Those who embody characteristics of both genders are influenced by counteracting energies, resulting in an ambiguous form. For a female embodying male characteristics, there are two types: one encounters a male as a wife and a female as a husband; another can be a wife but not a husband. There is also the case where the lower part is female while the upper part possesses the full male form; this is an instance of significant divergence.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some say: The irregular qi is primarily found in the yin aspect; does the form it creates differ from this? I reply: The yin body is empty, making it easy for the irregular qi to be present. The irregular qi&#39;s manifestation results from the mixing of yin and yang, having no principal source, and cannot be ascribed to either the left or the right. It receives qi from both sides and takes shape according to the lightness or heaviness of the irregular qi it bears; thus, the forms it embodies cannot be the same.</p>
<p>Yu Tuan said: The right, according to Danxi&#39;s discussion, delves into the subtle and profound, revealing what others have not. Therefore, it is understood that the distinction between man and woman is already established at the time when all things initially emerge from the primordial qi. At the moment when yin and yang intersect, those who are dim-witted fail to comprehend this principle and foolishly devise methods to change a female into a male, which is misguided. All things derive their beginnings from this primordial qi; is the distinction between man and woman not also derived from the primordial qi?</p>
<p>It is noted that if a woman wishes to determine the sex of her fetus after four months of pregnancy, the left pulse quickens for a boy, the right pulse for a girl, and if both quicken, it indicates twins. Furthermore, if a pregnant woman walks south and someone calls out from behind her, if she turns her head left, it indicates a boy; if she turns right, it indicates a girl. Similarly, when observing her behavior in labor, if someone calls out urgently from behind her, turning her head left indicates a boy, and turning right indicates a girl as well.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>On the right, Danxi says: A male is conceived in the left uterus, while a female is conceived in the right uterus. This statement is a great truth. The male fetus is on the left, thus the left is heavy; when turning the head, care is taken to protect the heavy side and thus it leans to the left. The female fetus is on the right, so the right is heavy; likewise, care is taken to protect the heavy side and it leans to the right. Applied to the pulse, the meaning is the same. If the fetus is on the left, the blood and qi protect the fetus and are abundant on the left, thus the pulse is strong on the left, indicating a male; a strong left pulse signifies a male. If the fetus is on the right, the blood and qi protect the fetus and are abundant on the right, so the pulse is strong on the right, indicating a female; a strong right pulse signifies a female. It is also as the classic says: the yin pulse is distinct from the yang pulse, indicating the presence of a child. The place of conception is below the navel, thus the blood and qi protect the fetus and are abundant below; that is why the yin pulse at the wrist is strong and distinct from the yang pulse at the inch. Similarly, if a sore or abscess arises above, the blood and qi surge from above and the inch pulse is strong; if it arises below, the blood and qi surge from below and the shichen pulse is strong; if it arises on the left, the blood and qi surge from the left and the left pulse is strong; if it arises on the right, the blood and qi surge from the right and the right pulse is strong. Danxi considers that a strong left pulse indicates a male and a strong right pulse indicates a female, serving as the physician&#39;s left and right hands, but this is one of the errors of the wise.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On the Beginnings of Form and Substance in Conception</strong>  </p>
<p>In the beginning, there is the source of all qi, which heaven takes to regulate the qi. The primary origin is the source of all forms, which the earth takes to regulate the forms. Thus, the light and clear corresponds to heaven, receiving the vigorous and strong yang to stand above; the heavy and turbid corresponds to earth, accumulating the yielding and gentle yin to reside below. By responding to the virtues of the earth, transformation occurs, and by engaging with the principles of the heavens, management is undertaken. Therefore, heaven and earth mutually cause each other, generating and transforming life, rendering all things manifest. The <em>Yijing</em> states: &quot;Great is the primal source, all things begin from it.&quot; Thus, the yang influences and the yin transforms, blood and qi harmonize, and conception arises, also based on the principles of beginning and sustaining life.</p>
<p>At the onset of forming, the life gate is first established. The primal one generates water; ren is the yang water, which combines with ding&#39;s yin fire to produce bing, the life gate, and then the heart forms, the heart governs the blood vessels. Bing is the yang fire, which combines with xin&#39;s yin metal to produce geng; with the heart there is then the lung, which governs the skin and hair. Geng is the yang metal, which combines with yi&#39;s yin wood to produce jia; with the lung there is then the liver, which governs the tendons and nails. Jia is the yang wood, which combines with ji&#39;s yin earth to produce wu; with the liver there is then the spleen, which governs the muscles. Wu is the yang earth, which combines with gui&#39;s yin water to produce ren; with the spleen there is then the kidney, which governs the bone marrow.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

Furthermore, concerning the development of the embryo during pregnancy, this is something that can be substantiated by texts.

The growth of both air and flavor is fundamental; thus, the Five Energies of Heaven and the Five Flavors of Earth are consumed by the mother, and the fetus also feeds on them. Externally, they fill the physical body, and internally, they nourish the energy of the fetus, all of which depends on the sustenance of air and flavor. Now, the first nourishment of the fetus arises from the Jueyin. The &quot;Sacred Regulations&quot; states that the seasonal transformation begins with Wood. Investigating the nourishment from the twelve meridians, it initiates with the Liver. Thus, during the first month, blood coagulates, nourished by the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian. The Gallbladder is the organ of the Liver. In the second month, the embryonic sign emerges, nourished by the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian. In the third month, the Yang Spirit is harmonized as the Soul; Wood generates Fire, and the Hand Pericardium Meridian nourishes it.

When the five elements are complete, all the bones will be prepared; this is how the spirits of all things are gathered. If there are remarkable changes in fullness and depletion, strength and weakness of rigidity and softness, and the fluctuations of nourishment and defense, these are felt at the beginning of the essence&#39;s endowment. In the silent depths, those who are clear yield children who are wise and clever, long-lived, and healthy; those who are muddy produce dull and short-lived offspring.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The essence governed by Yin ensures a person&#39;s longevity. In the past, there was a wife with many concubines but no children; she chose a good family with an unmarried girl of appropriate age, yet still had no children. When asked if there is a way to seek a son, Zhu Cheng said: For a couple to unite, they must be at the right age. Although a boy may be knowledgeable at sixteen, he must marry at thirty; though a girl may experience her first menstruation at fourteen, she should marry at twenty. Only when the energies of Yin and Yang are complete and substantial can they unite, leading to conception, nurturing, and the birth of strong and healthy children.</p>
<p>Now, for a girl who is yet to reach maturity, with her first menstruation just beginning, she is close to attracting male interest. If the Yin energy leaks prematurely before it is fully developed and substantial, this results in union but no conception, conception but no nurturing, and nurturing leading to fragile and short-lived children. This early pairing harms the balance of Yin and Yang, resulting in childlessness.</p>
<p>When a woman only gives birth to daughters, it is often due to excessive desire. Conversely, when all births are sons, this is due to the man refraining from excess. He could engage in the act one, three, or five days after the woman’s menstrual cycle, leading to a higher chance of conceiving a son at midnight. If intercourse occurs two, four, or six days after, the result will likely be daughters. If it happens beyond six days, the opportunity for conception fades.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sayings on Infants at Birth</strong></p>
<p>A child, upon birth, inherits the dual forces of yin and yang, and afflictions arise from the three burners (sanjiao). It is easier to nurture the robust and mature, but difficult for the young and tender. Some say that those who cannot discern the young are thus categorized for separate care. Moreover, the physical form and longevity of a child depend entirely on essence and blood; when these two are harmonious, conception occurs, resulting in a birth after ten months in the mother&#39;s womb. Overall, life spans, fortune or misfortune, intelligence or ignorance, are all predetermined; how could one escape this fate?<br><strong>Secrets of Infant Nurturing by Wan Quan (Ming)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nurturing in the Womb to Preserve the True Nature</strong></p>
<p>The Treatise on Pregnant Children states: The utmost essence is transformed, and when the vital force condenses, it begins to receive the womb, gradually forming its physical shape. While in the womb, the child listens and perceives as the mother does. After conception, the mother must sit and act with propriety, maintain a peaceful disposition, and often stay in a tranquil room, listening to beautiful words. One should recite poetry and classics, explain rites and music, avoiding harmful speech and evil sights. By doing so, the offspring will generally be blessed with longevity, loyalty, filial piety, wisdom, and virtue. Otherwise, they may end up base, short-lived, and foolish—this is called being influenced externally and responding internally. In times past, Tai Ren, while carrying King Wen, did not listen to vile words, did not see ugly sights, nor spoke vile speech. This has become the traditional method of prenatal education. The three months of pregnancy are called the beginning of fetal development. During this time, blood does not circulate, the form begins to take shape, and there are no fixed patterns, which change upon seeing objects. It is important to maintain decorum and seriousness, allowing the mother to meet noble persons and avoiding those with ugly appearances.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To conceive a boy, one should practice archery and ride a strong horse; to conceive a girl, one should wear earrings and adorn oneself with jewelry. If one desires a beautiful child, one should play with white jade and observe peacocks; if one desires a wise and capable child, one should read poetry and prose, and strive for harmony and elegance. I have seen common women during pregnancy, engaging in activities like moving puppets, dressing idols, and performance arts, and those who later bore children often resembled those figures.</p>
<p>There are methods for nurturing the fetus, and there are also ways to transform a girl into a boy, all governed by natural principles. For instance, eating rooster (a male chicken) gathers the masculine essence from the heavens; wearing realgar (a mineral containing arsenic) absorbs the male energy from the earth; practicing archery and wielding axes draws upon the visibility of masculine elements in human actions. The corresponding energies are intimately connected, and the secrets of creation indicate that before the three-month mark when forms begin to take shape, the influence of yang (masculine) can overcome yin (feminine), thus transforming a girl into a boy, and this is indeed a natural principle.</p>
<p>Heaven has five energies, each with its affinities; the earth has five flavors, each with its balanced inputs. Each gathering has its proper timing, and each input has its measurements. All that one fears or avoids should be treated with caution; nurturing through the resources of nature is an inherent principle. Additionally, one should regulate their emotions and desires, limit excessive indulgences, and labor diligently but thoughtfully, and then the vital energies and blood will follow suit.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

If this is not the case, when one receives the essence of life at the moment of conception and fails to maintain proper nourishment, internally one becomes insufficient in maintaining balance, and externally too weak to support the body, leading to diseases due to inadequate energy and vitality.

<p>Furthermore, it is from this principle that nurturing begins. A child in the mother’s womb draws upon the energy from the mother’s five organs for sustenance. If any of these organs is injured, the energy from that organ becomes depleted and insufficient.

<p>During pregnancy, if one is ill, one should not recklessly take medication. It is essential for a physician to carefully assess the severity of the illness, the nature of the medicine, and apply a moderate approach without excessive variety. If the illness is seen to be waning, it is proper to stop the medication, thus the illness will leave the mother, and the child will not be lost. Generally, if a pregnant woman is without illness, she should not take medicine. If there is illness, the primary focus should be on harmonizing the fetus; if it is a minor ailment, one should not overuse medicine.

<p><strong>General Discussion on Infants</strong></p>
<p>It is said that the field of pediatric medicine, which the ancients referred to as the &quot;silent illness,&quot; is the most challenging to treat. This saying is indeed true! Infants present a difficulty in diagnosis because it is hard to inquire about symptoms or assess the pulse. In addition, their organs are delicate, and the use of strong or extreme cold and heat medicines should not be taken lightly. </p>
<p>Let us discuss this in detail: An infant who is still in swaddling has no internal conflicts of emotions and desires, and is not subjected to the ravages of extreme wind or cold. What serious and numerous illnesses could they possibly have in such conditions? If we examine the symptoms, most are due to fetal toxins, and a minor proportion are caused by food injuries. As for external signs of wind and cold, they are rather rare.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said: changes in steaming, pox, mottling and rotting, anxiety and fright, wind convulsions, seizures, phlegm obstruction, red tumors, white baldness, relief from cranial pressure, heavy tongue and wood tongue—these various symptoms, are they not caused by the mother&#39;s negligence of the fetal poison? When a child is in the womb, if the mother is hungry, the child is hungry; if the mother is full, the child is full. Spicy foods suit the taste, the fetal energy follows the heat, emotions stir within, and the fetal breath becomes restless. Whether there is excessive consumption of fried foods or indulgence in spicy and sour flavors, or unrestrained desires, or fluctuating emotions, all can cause afflictions to the child. The ancients spoke wisely when they said that women in pregnancy should not lie sideways, sit carelessly, stand unceremoniously, or eat improper foods. Their words are profound! The principles of diet and nurturing for both males and females during pregnancy must deeply align with the essence of nature&#39;s continuous life. Therefore, the ancients often enjoyed longevity, while few children faced early death; this is the reason. I have observed in modern times that some women with gentle and mild dispositions, who do not indulge in uncontrolled desires during pregnancy, give birth to children with few illnesses and rare pox; they can serve as models for others.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Broad Discussions on Principles</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Guo Zizhang]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Before Birth</strong>  </p>
<p>Cai said: When a child is in the mother&#39;s womb, if the mother is unaware of restrictions, she may indulge in spicy foods or give in to lustful desires. This can accumulate toxins and flow into the child&#39;s meridians, which later manifest as sores, pustules, or rashes. This is the source of such ailments. The &quot;Illustrated Manual&quot; states: An infant in the womb receives the essence of yin, yang, and the five elements, which gives rise to its organs and bodily structure. Although the form is present, the flesh is not yet solid, and the bones are not yet formed. With sufficient yang energy but insufficient yin blood, one should not overindulge in warmth to diminish the yin; this is a major admonishment from Master Danxi. However, while in the womb, the child must rely on the mother&#39;s qi and blood for nourishment. Thus, if the mother is hot, the child is hot; if the mother is cold, the child is cold; if the mother is startled, the child is startled; if the mother is weak, the child is weak. This leads to symptoms of fetal heat, cold, shock, and weakness. The Xin&#39;an Prescription states: The source of sores and rashes is primarily due to the mother&#39;s dietary practices during pregnancy—eating fried, roasted, or overly rich foods and alcohol. The child, immersed in the mother&#39;s impure blood, accumulates toxins lodged within the five organs.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After birth, one may suffer from external influences such as wind and cold, internal harm from excessive cold, falls, fright, seasonal epidemics, or emotional disturbances, which can ignite internal heat. This may manifest on the skin: heart poison appears as spots, lung poison as rashes, liver poison as blisters, and spleen poison as pus-filled sores. Infants, being endowed with relatively robust health and balanced qi and blood, are more susceptible to these issues. However, if they are weak and toxic tendencies prevail, and both internal and external conditions are deficient with weak qi and blood, medical intervention is essential for survival.</p>
<p>I humbly suggest that the discussions among you reflect the ancient teachings on prenatal education. Among the ailments affecting infants, variola and rashes are particularly severe, and when parents suffer from these, who does not mourn? Yet those who are wise accept their fate, while the foolish are more distressed, creating their own misfortunes—who then can understand this? The young girls, who cannot read or discern, place blame on their fathers. The father recites teachings for the mother, while she nurtures and trains the child, hoping to cultivate a pure foundation for the future. I have heard that when a woman is pregnant, she should sleep separately, have a light diet, and be cautious with her senses, to ensure the child is upright, wise, strong, and healthy, thus mitigating any prenatal toxins and the severity of childhood diseases. Therefore, instead of lamenting later, it is far better to be meticulous at the outset.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Many Illnesses of Children Born to Pregnant Women Who Do Not Observe Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, the methods of nurturing pregnancy and teaching fetal development were taken very seriously. As a result, people in ancient times lived long lives and possessed great virtues, and there was a good reason for that. In today&#39;s world, women who are pregnant can follow the principles laid out in the &quot;Biographies of Exemplary Women,&quot; which emphasize the importance of maintaining a light diet, moderating hunger and satiety, thus ensuring that the pregnancy is marked by a clear qi (vital energy) and no illness. This leads to an easier labor and fewer ailments in the child, with occurrences of diseases like smallpox being rare. This can be seen as a result of the harmonious circulation of qi and blood.</p>
<p>However, in later generations, customs have gradually become lax, and few people are able to grasp these truths. Both men and women indulge their desires, often without restraint. During pregnancy, they pay little heed to these principles, which leads to discord in their qi and blood at the time of labor, resulting in panic and convulsions during childbirth. This is due to the fetus being affected by toxins, planting the seeds of deep-seated illnesses, such that even the best doctors and remedies are unable to help.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

She should avoid bad tastes in her food, refrain from eating improperly cut food, and should not sit on a misaligned seat. She should avert her gaze from improper sights and close her ears to lewd sounds. At night, she should have a blind person recite poetry and discuss proper matters, so that her child will be born with a proper appearance and surpass others in talent. ### Theory of Nurturing the Fetus It is an old saying that during the first three months of conception, the fetus undergoes various changes, and its qualities are not yet determined. Therefore, during these three months, if one wishes to witness rare natural phenomena, fierce beasts, precious jewels, or fine materials, or desires to see virtuous gentlemen with great moral character, one should observe ceremonial music and military arrangements, burn fragrant incenses, and orally recite poetry and ancient maxims. Living and dwelling in a tranquil environment, avoiding improperly cut food and misaligned seating, playing the guqin, and adjusting the mind and feelings are important; moderation in desires and maintaining purity in all matters will result in a good child who will live long, be loyal, filial, benevolent, righteous, wise, and free of ailments. This is the essence of King Wen's prenatal education. While a child is in the womb, the lunar and solar cycles are not yet complete, the yin and yang are not balanced, and the organs, bones, and joints have not fully formed. Thus, from the beginning of pregnancy until childbirth, there are various dietary prohibitions. Eating lamb liver during pregnancy can result in a difficult child; eating goat meat can lead to frequent illnesses. Eating donkey or horse meat can prolong the child's gestation; eating mule meat can make childbirth difficult. Eating rabbit or dog meat can result in a child born mute or with a cleft lip. Eating chicken or glutinous rice can lead to the child having many white worms."},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"If a woman is pregnant and eats chicken eggs and dried carp, her child will have many sores. If she eats mulberries and duck, her child will be born with a cold heart. If she eats sparrow meat and soybean paste, her child will have a darkened face filled with spots. If she eats sparrow meat and drinks alcohol, her child will be lustful and emotionally chaotic, lacking a sense of shame. If she eats turtle, her child will have a short neck. If she consumes ice and frost, it will result in miscarriage. During pregnancy, she should not urinate in unusual places, as it may lead to the death of the child. Moreover, it is said: The third month of pregnancy is called the beginning of the fetus; at this time, the shape is not yet established, and it changes according to what it sees. To conceive a boy, one should handle bows and arrows; to conceive a girl, one should play with pearls and jewels. If one desires a beautiful child, one should often gaze at jade; if one desires a virtuous child, one should sit upright in a tranquil state. This is called external appearance impacting internal feelings. **From \"Good Remedies for Women\" by Chen Ziming from the Song Dynasty**"},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"**On Prenatal Education** According to the \"On the Sources of Illness\" by the Chao Clan: In the first month of pregnancy, it is called the embryo, nurtured by the Foot Jueyin meridian; in the second month, it is called the initial essence, nurtured by the Foot Shaoyang meridian; in the third month, it is called the initial fetus, nurtured by the Hand Shenzong meridian. At this time, blood does not circulate, and forms start to take shape, without fixed features, thus subject to change due to external influences. To ensure the child is upright and dignified, one should often speak of proper words and act in accordance with virtuous deeds. If desiring a son, one should wear string and hold bow and arrows; if wanting a daughter, one should wear a belt and adorn with pendants. To have a beautiful child, one should wear white jade; to have an able and wise child, one should read poetry and books. This is known as the external appearance that inwardly influences. In the fourth month, the essence of water begins to form the blood vessels, nurtured by the Hand Shaoyang meridian; in the fifth month, the essence of fire begins to form the qi, nurtured by the Foot Taiyin meridian; in the sixth month, the essence of metal begins to form the muscles, nurtured by the Foot Yangming meridian; in the seventh month, the essence of wood begins to form the bones, nurtured by the Hand Taiyin meridian; in the eighth month, the essence of earth begins to form the skin, nurtured by the Hand Yangming meridian; in the ninth month, the essence of stone begins to form the hair, nurtured by the Foot Shaoyin meridian; by the tenth month, the five organs, six bowels, joints, and spirit are all complete. This summarizes the general principles. Additionally, there is a discussion from the theory on the five organs that describes the development: In the first month, like a dewdrop; in the second month, like a peach blossom; in the third month, distinctions between male and female; in the fourth month, the form is complete; in the fifth month, muscles and bones are formed; in the sixth month, hair begins to grow; in the seventh month, the soul can wander, and the child can move its left hand; in the eighth month, the spirit can wander, and the child can move its right hand; in the ninth month, it can turn three times; in the tenth month, it receives complete essence."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"Moreover, the \"Lú Huān Jīng\" states: In the first month, the fetus is formed from the coagulation of essence and blood; in the second month, the fetal shape is established, and the embryo is formed; in the third month, the yang spirit corresponds to the three souls; in the fourth month, the yin spirit corresponds to the seven corporeal souls; in the fifth month, the five elements correspond to the five organs; in the sixth month, the six laws establish the six entrails; in the seventh month, the essence opens the orifices to connect with brightness; in the eighth month, the original spirit possesses the true spirit; in the ninth month, the palace is adorned to define the birth of a person; in the tenth month, upon receiving sufficient qi, all manifestations are complete. Now, upon examining these numerical statements: those who speak of the five organs, for example, are merely shallow and ludicrous, falsely attaching their names; as for the three collections of Buddhist texts, they delve into the bizarre and are hard to verify. According to the three volumes of the \"Lú Huān Jīng,\" written by ancient magicians, certain thoughts on pregnancy assert that the fetus begins to take shape after three months. If one wishes to discuss correct words, conduct proper actions, wear cords of leather, handle bows and arrows, adorn with rings, don white jade, and read poetry and texts, could this not align with the principles of prenatal education? Let us consider what the Nesting Clan discussed, stating the principles of nurturing during pregnancy."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"If considering the liver meridian of the foot's Jueyin, and the gallbladder meridian of the foot's Shaoyang, they are part of one organ's channel, and the rest are similar. Moreover, the regulations of the four seasons must begin with the spring wood; hence, the nourishment of the twelve channels begins with the liver, which is why fetal nourishment occurs in the first and second months. The hand's heart protector meridian and the hand's Shaoyang Sanjiao meridian correspond to fire and are strong in summer, which is why nourishment for the fetus occurs in the third and fourth months. The hand's Taiyin and hand's Yangming are the heart meridians; being the officials of the sovereign, they are elevated without action. The foot's Taiyin spleen meridian and the foot's Yangming stomach meridian belong to earth and thrive in late summer, which is why fetal nourishment occurs in the fifth and sixth months. The hand's Taiyin lung meridian and the hand's Yangming large intestine meridian belong to metal and are strong in autumn, hence, fetal nourishment occurs in the seventh and eighth months. The foot's Shaoyin kidney meridian belongs to water and is strong in winter, so fetal nourishment takes place in the ninth month. Furthermore, the mother's kidneys are connected to the fetus, as they contain the mother's true qi, on which the child depends. By the tenth month, the child is nourished in the mother’s womb by the qi of all the organs and channels, awaiting the right time to be born. This discussion is profound and contains utmost principles. There are those in the world who are even more enlightened, but none surpass the theories of the Nestorian. I therefore recount this view."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"The Nest Theory states: Yang manifests and Yin transforms, when the essential energy is ample, there are cases of twins of both male and female. The Taoist Canon says: If a woman has relations on the first, third, or fifth day after her menstrual period on days favorable for male and female, there is a greater chance of conceiving a son. If both male and female contributions are robust, then there will be many children; if one is weak, there will be fewer children. The Luo Han Scripture states: When Yang is vigorous, it will produce a male. Various meridians all emphasize Yin. It also states: When three Yang gather, a male is born; when three Yin gather, a female is born. Ge Xianweng's \"After Elbow Formulas\" says: Males derive from the father's energy, females derive from the mother's energy. The Holy Medicinal Canon states: The virtue of heaven, the energy of earth, the utmost harmony of Yin and Yang, flows thinly into one body."},{"anchor":"trans-8p","marker":"8p","type":"translation","text":"Due to the movement of energy, if it moves to the left, it belongs to Yang, and when Yang is nourished, it becomes male; if it moves to the right, it belongs to Yin, and when Yin is nourished, it becomes female. The \"I Ching\" states that the path of the dry leads to the creation of males, while the path of the receptive leads to the creation of females; this is the distinction between men and women. In cases of pregnancy with complications, administering decoctions will reduce symptoms by more than half, allowing the illness to pass and the mother to be at peace, so the fetus remains unharmed. According to Dongyuan and Danxi: when the menstrual flow ceases for one or two days, the blood ceases its flow, and if the essence prevails over the blood, the result is male; after four or five days, the blood vessels become strong, and if the essence cannot prevail over the blood, the result is female. This is due to the interaction of paternal essence and maternal blood. When the essence is applied, the blood can capture the essence, hence resulting in a male; this is how all things begin from the creative principles of Yang. When the blood flows, the essence cannot capture it, hence resulting in a female; this signifies that all things are born from the receptive principles of Yin. When Yin and Yang interact, the embryo begins to form, and the place where it resides is termed the \"child's palace.\" It has one extension downward, leading to two branches, one to the left and one to the right."},{"anchor":"trans-9p","marker":"9p","type":"translation","text":"If the essence overcomes the blood, then the yang becomes the master, receiving energy from the left uterus, resulting in the formation of a male; if the essence does not overcome the blood, then the yin becomes the master, receiving energy from the right uterus, resulting in the formation of a female. This is a definitive theory regarding the matters of conception. As for the medications for pregnancy, they should be restricted, and one should refer to this domain for further examination. According to the Chu family, the union of male and female involves mutual affection. The yin blood arrives first, followed by the yang essence; the blood envelops the essence, which then enters the bones, resulting in the formation of a male. Conversely, if the yang essence enters first and the yin blood follows, it envelops the blood, which then becomes the foundation, resulting in a female. The yang energy gathers in the front, thus men have a heavier face; those who die from drowning must face down. The yin energy gathers in the back, hence women have a heavier back; those who drown must lie on their backs. This is true for both wild animals, regardless of how they die. When yin and yang are equally present, it is neither male nor female; when essence and blood are scattered, it foretells the signs of twin births. If the father is young and the mother is old, a female offspring will surely be weak; if the mother is strong and the father is weak, a male offspring will surely be frail."},{"anchor":"trans-10p","marker":"10p","type":"translation","text":"In ancient times, skilled artisans first examined this. When the vital energy is deficient, it should be replenished accordingly. To nourish weak women, invigorate the blood and strengthen the spleen; for weak men, enhance the kidneys and enrich their essence. Weak women should marry at an appropriate time, while weak men should wait until they are robust before marrying. This is the root of external afflictions; it must not be overlooked. Mr. Ma Yiqing argues that books on prenatal education and childbirth should not be dismissed as too antiquated to be credible, yet they should not be treated carelessly. Nowadays, families of common customs and improper practices may neglect proper precautions and rituals. Sometimes they suffer from poisons that cannot be expelled or give birth under adverse conditions, yet there are some fortunate enough to have healthy mothers and children. If one wishes to protect pregnancy, one must nurture in many ways to avoid future troubles. Just as if a neighbor undertakes construction, it may disturb the fetal energy, causing the child to be deformed or perish. If a knife strikes, the body must be injured; if mud is involved, the orifices will surely be blocked; if struck, the complexion will turn dark; if bound, the body will be restricted. Such experiences are as clear as the hand before the eye, and caution must be exercised."},{"anchor":"trans-11p","marker":"11p","type":"translation","text":"**The Chapter on the Root of the Universe** In the beginning, there was the Great Primal (Tai Chu) and the Great Beginning (Tai Shi). When chaos was first distinguished, the vital essence was seen; hence it is called the Great Primal. When forms were established, it is then termed the Great Beginning. As essence first takes shape and forms begin, heaven and earth mutually originate, generating and transforming endlessly, the myriad things become manifest. Thus it is said, \"Great indeed is the origin of Heaven, for it is the source of all things; profound indeed is the origin of the Earth, for it is the source of all life.\" (Note: Wu Yu's commentary states that before chaos was distinguished, essence and form were both non-existent; once chaos was distinguished, essence and form were separate. The sighting of essence is the Great Primal; the establishment of forms is the Great Beginning. The Great Primal is the root of all that has essence; therefore, heaven obtains it to govern the primal essence. The Great Beginning is the root of all that has form; therefore, the earth gains it to govern the primal form. When heaven and earth interact harmoniously, they are mutually caused by essence and form; that which generates life does so, and that which transforms is able to transform, while the myriad things move and their shapes, colors, and names are all made clear. Considered great is the origin of Heaven, where the Great Primal resides, hence the reference to it as the source of all things. Considered profound is the origin of the Earth, where the Great Beginning resides, hence the reference to it as the source of all life. Truly, all things derive their genesis and sustenance from Heaven and Earth; thus, the origin of Heaven brings forth omens, while the origin of Earth ensures all forms come into being.)"},{"anchor":"trans-12p","marker":"12p","type":"translation","text":"At the beginning of existence, although the Yang is in its proper form, it is the Yin that serves as the master as it nurtures and fulfills. As stated in Xue's Commentary on the Theory of Yin and Yang: Heaven covers, and Earth supports; all things are born. That which has not yet emerged from the Earth is termed Yin and is named the Yin within Yin; that which has emerged is termed Yang and is named the Yin within Yang. The Yang is in its proper form, while the Yin is the master. According to Wang Bing, the Yang imparts upright energy, allowing all things to be born; the Yin, being the master, allows various forms to manifest. The \"Character Explanations\" states: The initiator of life is Heaven and Earth; the nurturer is humanity. As forms change and shift, day transforms into night, and the way of the Earth ultimately concludes. As noted in the \"Liezi,\" in the Zhou Mu chapter, Master Yin Wen states: The transformation of forms is called change. In the \"Zhuangzi,\" the chapter on Tian Zifang says: The alternation of fullness and emptiness, one dark and one bright; day transforms into night, and each has its role, yet the results are often unseen. The text of the Earth Hexagram in the \"I Ching\" says: The way of Earth has no permanence but does have an end. The Earth bears Heaven, existing without permanence but having an end; is it forced by circumstances? The source of the way lies where, if living things are deprived of it, they die; if they have it, they live. In this, all beings heed its command. Thus, it is said that there is no permanence, yet an end exists—this is the teaching of the way.

Although some may conceive, many become pregnant but do not give birth, and among those who do give birth, many do not live long. In ancient discussions on aging and having children, it was stated that for men this would not extend beyond the age of eighty-eight and for women, not beyond seventy-seven, thus revealing that the vital essence within a person is inherently limited. Could one truly escape the fixed principles of yin and yang? In the discourse on nature, the Emperor asks: What about those who are older yet still have children? Qi Bo replies: This occurs when their heavenly lifespan is excessive, their vital energy is regularly flowing, and their kidney energy is abundant. Although such individuals may have children, men will not exceed the age of eighty-eight and women will not exceed seventy-seven, after which the essence of heaven and earth is depleted.

When we speak of the numbers seven and eight: seven represents lesser Yang, while eight embodies lesser Yin.

Consequently, yin culminates in ten, which men can encircle, while yang culminates in nine, which women can square. This interdependence of yin and yang results in the completion of life. Commentary: \"Zi Shuo\" states: Yin culminates in ten, men encircle it; yang culminates in nine, women square it. Nine has transformative potential, so women can square it. Ten has no transformations, so men can encircle it. Explanation: Men have homes to encircle the yin externally; women have households to contain the yang internally. The \"I Ching\" says: The fortune of a woman corresponds to unity and completion. The doctrine of the husband is defined by misfortune for the woman. Circles symbolize encirclement, representing the way of the ruler and of the husband. A circle allows for the systematization of principles in action. Squares symbolize benevolence, representing the way of subjects and of wives. A square represents pure unity. Men follow the circle, aligning with their principles; women adhere to benevolence, aligning with their responsibilities. Vital energy flourishes and is nurtured, all beginning with the child. Following from the child: the boy moves leftward in three decades and reaches maturity; the girl moves rightward in two decades and reaches maturity. The mature stage corresponds with the correct yang, from which yin genuinely follows. From this mature stage, pregnancy begins: the boy rotates leftward for ten months and is born in the year of the tiger; the girl rotates rightward for ten months and is born in the year of the monkey."},{"anchor":"trans-18p","marker":"18p","type":"translation","text":"The Shen corresponds to the three Yin, and the Yin corresponds to the three Yang, which signifies the time of birth and reproduction.

(Note: The text mentions that men born in the Yin (寅) belong to wood and are Yang, while women born in the Shen (申) belong to metal and are Yin. According to Yang’s commentary, the primal energy arises in the Zi, where humans are born. Men move left from Zi by thirty, while women move right by twenty, both arriving at the Yi, representing husband and wife conceiving. In ancient times, men married at thirty and women at twenty. A ten-month gestation results in men being born from the Si, moving left to Yin for ten months, and women from the Si, moving right to Shen for ten months.) As for different regions and environments, the yields are appropriate to their quantities; auspicious events bring favorable omens, and dreams align with their kinds.

Bears and tigers signify auspiciousness for males, while serpents and snakes signify auspiciousness for females. The method of fetal transformation includes what is said about turning females into males, which is all natural. For example, eating a male rooster extracts yang essence from what is obtained from heaven; using realgar, one extracts yang essence from the earth. **Note**: From \"Qianjin Fang\": To transform a female into a male, one can use Dan Shen pills made with the head of a male rooster from Dongmen. Another recipe: take one tael of realgar and enclose it in a crimson pouch. From \"Bencao\": The male rooster replenishes the weak and warms the center, opens the mind, and kills toxins; it nourishes the liver and replenishes the kidneys, and its comb enriches yang. Realgar, when worn, wards off spirits and cannot be harmed by toxins. Drawing the bow and arrows, using axes and chisels, refers to employing hard materials in human affairs; the essence of these things subtly connects, and creation transforms discreetly, signaling the form before the third month. Essentially, when the form is not yet fully manifested, yang can conquer yin, and it is indeed reasonable to transform a female into a male. **Note**: The Nest Scholar's theory states: pregnancy begins in the third month when the fetus starts taking shape.

Violating these prohibitions could lead to severe consequences such as loss of the fetus or harm to the mother; if not severe, the child may be deformed or suffer disabilities. Such violations cause dire outcomes. **Dietary Restrictions** After conception, there are many foods that should be avoided not only for the sake of the fetus's well-being but also for physical properties that should be heeded.

However, regarding diseases during pregnancy, it is often vague and unclear, as many overlook its significance, and physicians do not always understand it. A child in the womb shares the mother’s body; if she is warm, the child is warm; if cold, so is the child; if she is sick, the child is sick; if well, the child is well. Therefore, the mother’s diet and daily activities must be particularly cautious, as ignorance could lead to trouble. **On Fetal Perception** The discussion about the differentiation of sexes after conception, based on essence and blood, is from the argument of Chu Cheng. I find it quite perplexing. Later, I read Li Dongyuan's theory which states: if menstruation ceases one or two days later, and the blood sea begins to clear, the essence dominates the blood, resulting in a male; but if it is four to five days later, and the blood vessels are robust, the essence cannot overcome the blood, resulting in a female. This theory, however, remains unclarified. Why do I say this? The \"I Ching\" states: the dry principle produces males, and the moist principle produces females. The concepts of dry and moist refer to the nature of yin and yang. Left and right represent the pathways of yin and yang. Males and females are the symbols of yin and yang. The father’s essence and mother’s blood converge through perception. The release of essence is the expression of yang. Blood can contain it, representing the transformation of yin. The essence forms the bones; this marks the beginning of all things from the dry source. Blood forms the womb; this nourishes all things from the moist source. When yin and yang intersect, conception occurs. The place where the fetus resides is called the uterus. It is connected below, with two branches above reaching left and right. When the essence dominates the blood and is stimulated during the active period of the sun, it is thus male that is formed, receiving qi from the left side of the uterus."},{"anchor":"trans-26p","marker":"26p","type":"translation","text":"When the essence is insufficient to outweigh the blood, and during the times influenced by soft sunlight and阴 (yin), then the阴 (yin) becomes the dominant force, receiving energy from the right ovary, thus forming a female. Some ask: If there is division between male and female, what happens to twins? It is said: When the essence is plentiful, it diverges and splits, and the blood follows this division. As for simultaneous pregnancies of both male and female, during the strong sunlight of the day or the soft sunlight of the yin, when influenced, the energies mix, belonging neither to the left nor to the right, receiving energy from the two divergences. There can also be instances of three, four, five, or six fetuses, which are treated in the same way. Others ask: What about a male who cannot become a father, or a female who cannot become a mother? How do we differentiate among those who possess characteristics of both genders? I say: A male cannot become a father due to a deficiency of阳 (yang) energy. A female cannot become a mother due to an obstruction of阴 (yin) energy. Those who embody characteristics of both genders are influenced by counteracting energies, resulting in an ambiguous form. For a female embodying male characteristics, there are two types: one encounters a male as a wife and a female as a husband; another can be a wife but not a husband. There is also the case where the lower part is female while the upper part possesses the full male form; this is an instance of significant divergence."},{"anchor":"trans-27p","marker":"27p","type":"translation","text":"Some say: The irregular qi is primarily found in the yin aspect; does the form it creates differ from this? I reply: The yin body is empty, making it easy for the irregular qi to be present. The irregular qi's manifestation results from the mixing of yin and yang, having no principal source, and cannot be ascribed to either the left or the right. It receives qi from both sides and takes shape according to the lightness or heaviness of the irregular qi it bears; thus, the forms it embodies cannot be the same. Yu Tuan said: The right, according to Danxi's discussion, delves into the subtle and profound, revealing what others have not. Therefore, it is understood that the distinction between man and woman is already established at the time when all things initially emerge from the primordial qi. At the moment when yin and yang intersect, those who are dim-witted fail to comprehend this principle and foolishly devise methods to change a female into a male, which is misguided. All things derive their beginnings from this primordial qi; is the distinction between man and woman not also derived from the primordial qi? It is noted that if a woman wishes to determine the sex of her fetus after four months of pregnancy, the left pulse quickens for a boy, the right pulse for a girl, and if both quicken, it indicates twins. Furthermore, if a pregnant woman walks south and someone calls out from behind her, if she turns her head left, it indicates a boy; if she turns right, it indicates a girl. Similarly, when observing her behavior in labor, if someone calls out urgently from behind her, turning her head left indicates a boy, and turning right indicates a girl as well."},{"anchor":"trans-28p","marker":"28p","type":"translation","text":"On the right, Danxi says: A male is conceived in the left uterus, while a female is conceived in the right uterus. This statement is a great truth. The male fetus is on the left, thus the left is heavy; when turning the head, care is taken to protect the heavy side and thus it leans to the left. The female fetus is on the right, so the right is heavy; likewise, care is taken to protect the heavy side and it leans to the right. Applied to the pulse, the meaning is the same. If the fetus is on the left, the blood and qi protect the fetus and are abundant on the left, thus the pulse is strong on the left, indicating a male; a strong left pulse signifies a male. If the fetus is on the right, the blood and qi protect the fetus and are abundant on the right, so the pulse is strong on the right, indicating a female; a strong right pulse signifies a female. It is also as the classic says: the yin pulse is distinct from the yang pulse, indicating the presence of a child. The place of conception is below the navel, thus the blood and qi protect the fetus and are abundant below; that is why the yin pulse at the wrist is strong and distinct from the yang pulse at the inch. Similarly, if a sore or abscess arises above, the blood and qi surge from above and the inch pulse is strong; if it arises below, the blood and qi surge from below and the shichen pulse is strong; if it arises on the left, the blood and qi surge from the left and the left pulse is strong; if it arises on the right, the blood and qi surge from the right and the right pulse is strong.

Thus, the light and clear corresponds to heaven, receiving the vigorous and strong yang to stand above; the heavy and turbid corresponds to earth, accumulating the yielding and gentle yin to reside below. By responding to the virtues of the earth, transformation occurs, and by engaging with the principles of the heavens, management is undertaken. Therefore, heaven and earth mutually cause each other, generating and transforming life, rendering all things manifest. The *Yijing* states: \"Great is the primal source, all things begin from it.\" Thus, the yang influences and the yin transforms, blood and qi harmonize, and conception arises, also based on the principles of beginning and sustaining life. At the onset of forming, the life gate is first established. The primal one generates water; ren is the yang water, which combines with ding's yin fire to produce bing, the life gate, and then the heart forms, the heart governs the blood vessels. Bing is the yang fire, which combines with xin's yin metal to produce geng; with the heart there is then the lung, which governs the skin and hair.

Furthermore, concerning the development of the embryo during pregnancy, this is something that can be substantiated by texts.

The growth of both air and flavor is fundamental; thus, the Five Energies of Heaven and the Five Flavors of Earth are consumed by the mother, and the fetus also feeds on them. Externally, they fill the physical body, and internally, they nourish the energy of the fetus, all of which depends on the sustenance of air and flavor. Now, the first nourishment of the fetus arises from the Jueyin. The \"Sacred Regulations\" states that the seasonal transformation begins with Wood. Investigating the nourishment from the twelve meridians, it initiates with the Liver. Thus, during the first month, blood coagulates, nourished by the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian. The Gallbladder is the organ of the Liver. In the second month, the embryonic sign emerges, nourished by the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian.

Moreover, the Hand Taiyang Small Intestine Channel and Hand Shaoyin Heart Channel are not counted among the channels to be nurtured in the tenth month. In ordinary days, below is the monthly water; during gestation, above is the breast milk; thus, it does not nurture in the fetus. The embryo's initial signs begin, receiving the essence of water to form blood vessels, the essence of fire to form energy, the essence of metal to form tendons, the essence of wood to form bones, and the essence of earth to form skin, hide, and hair. When the five elements are complete, all the bones will be prepared; this is how the spirits of all things are gathered. If there are remarkable changes in fullness and depletion, strength and weakness of rigidity and softness, and the fluctuations of nourishment and defense, these are felt at the beginning of the essence's endowment. In the silent depths, those who are clear yield children who are wise and clever, long-lived, and healthy; those who are muddy produce dull and short-lived offspring.

In the past, there was a wife with many concubines but no children; she chose a good family with an unmarried girl of appropriate age, yet still had no children. When asked if there is a way to seek a son, Zhu Cheng said: For a couple to unite, they must be at the right age. Although a boy may be knowledgeable at sixteen, he must marry at thirty; though a girl may experience her first menstruation at fourteen, she should marry at twenty. Only when the energies of Yin and Yang are complete and substantial can they unite, leading to conception, nurturing, and the birth of strong and healthy children. Now, for a girl who is yet to reach maturity, with her first menstruation just beginning, she is close to attracting male interest. If the Yin energy leaks prematurely before it is fully developed and substantial, this results in union but no conception, conception but no nurturing, and nurturing leading to fragile and short-lived children. This early pairing harms the balance of Yin and Yang, resulting in childlessness. When a woman only gives birth to daughters, it is often due to excessive desire. Conversely, when all births are sons, this is due to the man refraining from excess. He could engage in the act one, three, or five days after the woman’s menstrual cycle, leading to a higher chance of conceiving a son at midnight. If intercourse occurs two, four, or six days after, the result will likely be daughters. If it happens beyond six days, the opportunity for conception fades.

Moreover, the physical form and longevity of a child depend entirely on essence and blood; when these two are harmonious, conception occurs, resulting in a birth after ten months in the mother's womb. Overall, life spans, fortune or misfortune, intelligence or ignorance, are all predetermined; how could one escape this fate? **Secrets of Infant Nurturing by Wan Quan (Ming)** **Nurturing in the Womb to Preserve the True Nature** The Treatise on Pregnant Children states: The utmost essence is transformed, and when the vital force condenses, it begins to receive the womb, gradually forming its physical shape. While in the womb, the child listens and perceives as the mother does. After conception, the mother must sit and act with propriety, maintain a peaceful disposition, and often stay in a tranquil room, listening to beautiful words. One should recite poetry and classics, explain rites and music, avoiding harmful speech and evil sights. By doing so, the offspring will generally be blessed with longevity, loyalty, filial piety, wisdom, and virtue. Otherwise, they may end up base, short-lived, and foolish—this is called being influenced externally and responding internally. In times past, Tai Ren, while carrying King Wen, did not listen to vile words, did not see ugly sights, nor spoke vile speech. This has become the traditional method of prenatal education. The three months of pregnancy are called the beginning of fetal development. During this time, blood does not circulate, the form begins to take shape, and there are no fixed patterns, which change upon seeing objects.

I have seen common women during pregnancy, engaging in activities like moving puppets, dressing idols, and performance arts, and those who later bore children often resembled those figures. There are methods for nurturing the fetus, and there are also ways to transform a girl into a boy, all governed by natural principles. For instance, eating rooster (a male chicken) gathers the masculine essence from the heavens; wearing realgar (a mineral containing arsenic) absorbs the male energy from the earth; practicing archery and wielding axes draws upon the visibility of masculine elements in human actions. The corresponding energies are intimately connected, and the secrets of creation indicate that before the three-month mark when forms begin to take shape, the influence of yang (masculine) can overcome yin (feminine), thus transforming a girl into a boy, and this is indeed a natural principle. Heaven has five energies, each with its affinities; the earth has five flavors, each with its balanced inputs. Each gathering has its proper timing, and each input has its measurements. All that one fears or avoids should be treated with caution; nurturing through the resources of nature is an inherent principle.

Just as when eating a rabbit one can be left without lips, or when eating a dog one may find no sound, and when eating mixed fish one may suffer from conditions like scabies—these are all due to a lack of caution in dietary habits. Great astonishment of the heart can lead to manic conditions, insufficient kidney energy can cause headaches, disharmony of the spleen and stomach can lead to weakness, and weakness of the heart energy can cause a lack of spirit; all these issues arise from an imbalance of Qi and blood. Furthermore, it is from this principle that nurturing begins. A child in the mother’s womb draws upon the energy from the mother’s five organs for sustenance. If any of these organs is injured, the energy from that organ becomes depleted and insufficient. For instance, wind can harm the liver, heat can damage the heart and lungs, dampness can injure the spleen, and cold can affect the kidneys—these are injuries inflicted by the four seasonal energies of heaven.

It is essential for a physician to carefully assess the severity of the illness, the nature of the medicine, and apply a moderate approach without excessive variety. If the illness is seen to be waning, it is proper to stop the medication, thus the illness will leave the mother, and the child will not be lost.

In addition, their organs are delicate, and the use of strong or extreme cold and heat medicines should not be taken lightly. Let us discuss this in detail: An infant who is still in swaddling has no internal conflicts of emotions and desires, and is not subjected to the ravages of extreme wind or cold.

The ancients spoke wisely when they said that women in pregnancy should not lie sideways, sit carelessly, stand unceremoniously, or eat improper foods. Their words are profound! The principles of diet and nurturing for both males and females during pregnancy must deeply align with the essence of nature's continuous life. Therefore, the ancients often enjoyed longevity, while few children faced early death; this is the reason.

With sufficient yang energy but insufficient yin blood, one should not overindulge in warmth to diminish the yin; this is a major admonishment from Master Danxi. However, while in the womb, the child must rely on the mother's qi and blood for nourishment. Thus, if the mother is hot, the child is hot; if the mother is cold, the child is cold; if the mother is startled, the child is startled; if the mother is weak, the child is weak. This leads to symptoms of fetal heat, cold, shock, and weakness.

Subsequently, he had four more sons, and both the first and second ones died from similar tumors. What could be the reason for this? The next day I visited and explained: You are carrying hidden fire in your kidneys, and the essence and energy contain an excess of red threads; this is passed down, causing the child to suffer this illness, commonly known as a fetal tumor. You should observe this; it was indeed as I said. So, I prescribed kidney-replenishing pills to dispel the fire within the kidneys and to replenish the inadequate true yin. Avoid alcohol, vinegar, pungent, and hot foods. His wife took Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills to nourish yin and blood. After five months of pregnancy, use Huang Qin and Bai Zhu to make a powder and take it five or seven times. Subsequently, he successfully had three more sons, and the previous symptoms did not recur."},{"anchor":"orig-1p","marker":"1p","type":"original","text":"古今图书集成医部全录卷四百一 小儿未生胎养门
