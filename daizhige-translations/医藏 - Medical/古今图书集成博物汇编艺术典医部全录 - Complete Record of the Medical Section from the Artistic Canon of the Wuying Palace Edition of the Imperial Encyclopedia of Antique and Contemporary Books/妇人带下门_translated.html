<p><strong>Women&#39;s Leucorrhea Door</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Bones and Empty Spaces</strong></p>
<p>&quot;When disorders occur in the Ren Meridian, women experience leucorrhea and abdominal masses.&quot;<br><em>[Note: The Ren Meridian circulates in the abdomen, hence the disorder manifests in that area.]</em><br><strong>Essentials of the Golden Chamber</strong> (Han Dynasty, by Zhang Ji)<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis of Leucorrhea Disease</strong></p>
<p>Women’s ailments arise from a deficiency that causes cold accumulation and blocked qi, leading to the disruption of the menstrual flow over many years, resulting in cold and blood stagnation at the gate of the womb. Cold injures the meridians, becoming hardened above, causing vomiting of saliva and phlegm, which over time can develop into lung abscesses, damaging the body&#39;s vitality. In the middle abdomen, there may be a cold hernia around the navel, or pain in the flanks connected to the organs, or a binding of heat within causing pain in the lower abdomen, with a pulse that is rapid without sores. The skin may appear like fish scales, and these symptoms can also manifest in men, not only in women. </p>
<p>In the lower abdomen, symptoms aren&#39;t pronounced, the menstrual cycle is irregular, leading to painful pulling in the genitals, coldness in the lower abdomen, or radiating pain in the lower back and spine. The qi is in upheaval, causing rapid, intense pain, knee and shin discomfort, sudden dizziness or faintness resembling syncope, and emotional distress characterized by worry and excessive anger. All these symptoms are aspects of leucorrhea and are not the result of supernatural beings. Over time, there may be emaciation, a weak pulse with much cold, reflecting the complexity of thirty-six diseases and myriad variations. </p>
<p>Careful examination of the pulse on both yin and yang, and distinguishing between deficiency and excess, allows for precise treatment with acupuncture and herbal medicine, ensuring safety in critical situations. Although the same disease may present, the pulses may differ; therefore, one must distinguish and take note, lest one claims otherwise. </p>
<p>A question was asked: A woman aged fifty has experienced profuse discharges for several days without cessation, with evening fevers, urgent sensations in the lower abdomen, fullness in the belly accompanied by heat in the palms, and dryness of the lips and mouth. Why is this? The teacher replied: This ailment is related to leucorrhea. Why is that? It has been chronic after a partial delivery, where stagnant blood remains in the lower abdomen. How can we know? The sign of dry lips and mouth indicates this. One should treat with Warm Meridians Decoction. If the menstrual circulation is obstructed, with fullness and pain in the lower abdomen, and it persists for a month, then Earth Gourd Root Powder should be the prescription.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Classics</strong> (by Wang Shuhe from the Jin Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Evidence</strong></p>
<p>When the great wind evil enters the Lesser Yin, a woman experiences a white discharge that turns red. The master said: In women, the six major diseases of discharge, if the pulse is floating, it indicates intestinal rumbling and abdominal fullness; if it is tight, it signifies abdominal pain; if it is rapid, it suggests itching in the Yin area; if it is surging, it leads to sores; if it is wiry, it indicates painful pulls in the Yin area. The master said: Discharge has three gates: the first is the womb gate, the second is the dragon gate, and the third is the jade gate. For those who have given birth, it pertains to the womb gate; for those who haven&#39;t given birth, it relates to the dragon gate; unmarried girls correspond to the jade gate. </p>
<p>When asked: What are the three diseases of women who have not yet been through the door? The master said: The first disease occurs when menstruation first begins, with heat in the Yin area, sometimes in the wind or when fanned; the second disease may arise from washing with cold water; the third disease may come from a shock or fright, leading to discharge. The master said: In women&#39;s discharge, there are nine substantial matters. For instance, if afflicted by the disease of rat&#39;s milk, the symptoms are severe and sudden, with a specific period indicated by the heavenly stems and earthly branches. The rest follow this pattern.</p>
<p>When asked: There is a woman aged fifty who suffers only from back pain, experiences occasional abdominal pain, dislikes food, is prone to bloating, and her pulse is weak with a tight guan and chi, the superficial pulse not corresponding. I wish to know what you say. The master said: One should inquire about the patient&#39;s eating habits. If she says she does not want to eat or smells a foul grain scent, then the disease is in the upper jiao.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>If a patient says they have little desire to eat, and can do without food, the illness is in the middle burner. If a patient says they eat and drink as usual, the illness is in the lower burner. If the illness belongs to leukorrhea, it should be treated accordingly. </p>
<p>A question was asked: If a woman suffers from a condition like epilepsy with many episodes in a day, and the teacher checks her pulse, finding it exhibits leukorrhea as mentioned, what type of pulse is this, and how can it be differentiated? The teacher replied: The cun pulse is soft yet tight. Softness indicates weak yang, while tightness indicates cold in the channels. With weak yang and a deficiency in protective qi, the blood is exhausted and congealed with cold. Yin and yang are imbalanced, and evil qi takes refuge in the protective network. </p>
<p>The illness may arise from an early onset of menstruation due to engaging in intimate relations, leading to excessive strain. This causes the essence to affect the life gate, resulting in blood deficiency from menstrual loss, causing the channels to engorge. The central cavity feels the movement of yang, and a slight breeze causes cold to arise, leaving the protective network vacated, leading to cold accumulation in the lower abdomen. This triggers an upward thrust, rushing to the chest cavity, where fluids are obstructed, overflowing with saliva and drool, presenting symptoms like dizziness and syncope. The qi surges in the hips creating heat, which is commonly referred to as epilepsy by inexperienced doctors, but burning moxibustion can exacerbate the condition.</p>
<p>When diagnosing a woman with bleeding that is red and white, if the blood flow is frequent, a rapid pulse indicates death; a slower pulse suggests survival. </p>
<p>For a woman with persistent bleeding that is red and white, a pulse that is small and weak indicates survival, while a tight, rapid pulse suggests death. </p>
<p>For women experiencing leukorrhea, if the pulse is floating and there is a strong aversion to cold with ongoing leakage, it is not advisable to treat.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong> (Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>On Red and White Vaginal Discharge and Menstrual Irregularities</strong></p>
<p>Various texts describe thirty-six ailments, twelve symptoms, nine pains, seven harms, five injuries, and three stubborn conditions that obstruct flow. What are the twelve symptoms? They are the discharges, which include: first, resembling mucus; second, like black blood; third, like purplish fluid; fourth, like red flesh; fifth, like pus crust; sixth, like bean juice; seventh, like amaranth soup; eighth, like congealed blood; ninth, like clear blood, blood resembling water; tenth, like rice wash; eleventh, like menstrual flow, sometimes abundant and sometimes sparse; twelfth, when the menstrual cycle does not match the expected date. </p>
<p>What are the nine pains? They consist of: first, pain from injury in the lower body; second, pain from dripping in the lower body; third, pain during urination; fourth, cold-related pain; fifth, abdominal pain during menstruation; sixth, pain from fullness of qi; seventh, pain in the lower body as if infested by insects; eighth, pain in the side; ninth, pain in the waist and hips. </p>
<p>What are the seven harms? They include: first, pain and obstruction in the openings; second, pain from cold and heat; third, urgent and hardened pain in the lower abdomen; fourth, insensitivity of the internal organs; fifth, pain radiating to the back due to issues in the reproductive area; sixth, menstrual flow that is sometimes excessive and sometimes scant; seventh, harm causing vomiting.</p>
<p>What are the five injuries? They are: first, pain in both sides; second, heart pain radiating to the sides; third, blockage of qi; fourth, excessive thoughts leading to discharge; fifth, stubborn cold in the front and back.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>What are the three ailments? First, emaciation with no flesh on the skin; second, inability to produce milk; third, blockage of menstruation. Diseases vary in nature, and treatments are likewise not uniform. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Childbirth Treasure Formula,&quot; among the thirty-six ailments caused by leucorrhea, there are twelve symptoms, nine pains, seven harms, five injuries, and three blockages, collectively referred to as the thirty-six ailments. The twelve symptoms pertain to the discharges: one resembles pus, two resembles green blood, three like purple fluid, four like red skin, five like pus scabs, six like bean juice, seven like sunflower soup, eight like coagulated blood, nine like clear blood, ten like rice grain discharge, eleven like menstrual flow, and twelve when the cycle is irregular. </p>
<p>The nine pains are: first, pain in the lower abdomen, second, pain in the perineum, third, pain during urination, fourth, cold pain, fifth, abdominal pain upon menstruation, sixth, foot pain when there is fullness, seventh, pain in the perineum like a biting insect, eighth, pain under the ribs, and ninth, pain in the lower back. </p>
<p>The seven harms are: first, harm from food, second, harm from qi, third, harm from cold, fourth, harm from exertion, fifth, harm from intercourse, sixth, harm from pregnancy, and seventh, harm from sleep. </p>
<p>The five injuries are: first, pain in the orifice, second, cold pain, third, pain in the lower abdomen, fourth, unfeeling organs, and fifth, misalignment causing back pain. </p>
<p>The three blockages refer to menstrual flow being obstructed. The details of the other two are not included, but the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; mentions that all thirty-six types of ailments arise from the internal cold, heat, and strain of the reproductive organs.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Women&#39;s Health Remedies - By Chen Ziming (Song Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five Types of Discharge</strong></p>
<p>For women, there are five types of discharge. This occurs due to the invasion of wind pathogens into the womb after menstruation or childbirth, affecting the organs. If the liver channel (foot Jueyin) is injured, the discharge appears dark green; if the heart channel (hand Shaoyin) is affected, it looks like red drool; if the lung channel (hand Taiyin) is harmed, it resembles nasal mucus; if the spleen channel (foot Taiyin) is involved, it appears yellow like rotten melon; if the kidney channel (foot Shaoyin) is damaged, it looks black like stagnant blood. </p>
<p>There exists a channel called the &quot;Dai Mai&quot; that runs horizontally around the waist, resembling a belt, and diseases arise from this, hence the name &quot;Dai.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to Mr. Xu Yongcheng, the white discharge is linked to qi and the red is connected to blood. Mr. Dongyuan states that prolonged blood loss can lead to yang deficiency. Therefore, a white, slippery substance that flows down does not necessarily confine to the Dai channel; it may also involve damp phlegm descending to the lower burner, excess yin from the kidney and liver, or downward flow caused by shock and fear leading to turbid fluids, or emotional distress causing muscle weakness. </p>
<p>For those with six pulses that are slippery, strong, and large, one should use methods to promote and guide this discharge; this can be considered as purging. Dongyuan suggests if the pulse is thin, deep, tight, or large and empty, one should tonify yang and regulate menstruation, addressing the underlying deficiency as well.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Danxi used substances like haishi (seawater stone), nansheng (south star), and the bark of the chinquapin root to treat damp phlegm. I humbly suggest that for prior syndromes, it is essential to strengthen the spleen and stomach, primarily boosting yang qi, while assisting with medications from various channels according to symptoms. For symptoms represented by the color blue, which relates to the liver, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with山栀 (huangzhī) and 防风 (fangfeng); for damp-heat stagnation with red, painful urination, use Long Dan Cao Decoction to clear the liver; if liver blood is insufficient or there is dryness-heat or wind-heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For the color red, which belongs to the heart, utilize Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with huanglian, 山栀, and danggui; if thinking and worry have been excessive, employ Miaoxiang San and other medications. For the color white, which is associated with the lungs, adopt Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with 山栀. For the color yellow, which pertains to the spleen, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction with 山栀 and Chai Hu; if it does not respond, apply Gui Pi Decoction. For the color black, connecting to the kidneys, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If both qi and blood are deficient, take Ba Zhen Tang. If yang qi is sinking, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If damp phlegm has descended, augment the previous decoction with Fu Ling, Ban Xia, Cang Zhu, and Huang Mi. For qi deficiency and phlegm fluid descent, use Si Qi Tang to complement Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. One should not insist that fat people have more phlegm while thin people have more heat, and lightly treat them with drying dampness and clearing heat medications.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Jisheng Fang - Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Sources of the Chao Clan&#39;s Diseases,&quot; there are thirty-six ailments specific to women. Among those, seven symptoms, eight masses, and twelve types of vaginal discharge are mentioned. However, the so-called twelve types of vaginal discharge do not explicitly describe their symptoms. The prevalent conditions today are merely red and white discharges. Analyzing their origins, it results from excessive strain, dysfunction of the Chong and Ren channels, and the invasion of wind and cold in the uterus, which is the cause of these illnesses.</p>
<p>Additionally, during ordinary times, a woman&#39;s blood should be abundant, while her qi should be relatively less, which implies that proper qi supports health and prevents diseases. If, by chance, the qi exceeds the blood, it produces cold, and the blood fails to transform into a red state, thus resulting in a white discharge. Conversely, if the qi is balanced but the blood is insufficient, the blood generates heat, and when it fails to transform into a red state, it causes a red discharge. When cold and heat combine, both red and white discharges may occur.</p>
<p>For unmarried women or those who have given birth and suffer from these ailments, it can lead to issues with conceiving, leading to infertility. Anyone exhibiting these symptoms should seek treatment promptly. If left untreated for long, it can result in a dark complexion, emaciation of the muscles, abdominal and flank distension, painful stabbing sensations; and even the limbs may become thin and cold, causing extreme discomfort and inability to eat.</p>
<p>When diagnosing the pulse, if the right wrist’s pulse is floating, it signifies yang, and when yang is depleted, it indicates an inability to conceive, often accompanied by cold feet and vaginal discharge.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Hejian Six Writings</strong>  【Jin - Liu Wansuo】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion and Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Red conditions heat into the small intestine, while white conditions heat into the large intestine. Fundamentally, they are both due to damp-heat stagnating in the channels, leading to an overabundance of fluids, which manifests as red and white discharges. There is initially no pain from the stagnation, but due to the deficiency in the five channels, the accumulated heat becomes constricted in the belt channel. Thus, women experience continuous pain below the navel, and sometimes discharges from the genitalia. Hence the classic states: the Ren channel is affected; men may have seven types of internal accumulations, while women deal with discharges and accumulations from the belt channel. Wang&#39;s commentary states: the Ren channel runs from above the womb over the belt channel, connecting above the navel. Therefore, men face internal accumulations of seven issues, while women suffer discharge issues. The belt channel arises from the lower ribs&#39; Zhangmen point, resembling a supportive belt. Currently, damp-heat is bound and stagnant, causing illness. The classics state: the spleen transmits to the kidneys; this malady is termed &quot;accumulation and hernia,&quot; featuring painful, heat-laden conditions in the lower abdomen with white discharges, also referred to as &quot;poison,&quot; hence associated with discharges&#39; binding. Binding refers to constriction, causing stagnant heat that does not dissipate. First, treat with a decoction of ten jujubes, then take bitter neem pills and Dazhuansuan to help clear the heat and eliminate dampness, allowing the condition to heal spontaneously.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>The Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong> </p>
<p>Red and white are confused, cold and heat are resolved. </p>
<p>In the selected &quot;Holy Essential Formulas&quot; from twenty-three volumes, it discusses women&#39;s leucorrhea, stating: Women&#39;s discharge is due to excessive mental strain, which damages the menstrual blood, leading to a weakened body susceptible to cold winds. The cold winds invade the channels, affecting the blood as it is formed. In the &quot;Inner Chapters&quot; of the Chao family, from forty-four volumes, it discusses that the Ren channel is regarded as the sea of the channels; when there is a disorder in it, for women, it manifests as leucorrhea. The Hand Taiyang corresponds to the Small Intestine channel, and the Hand Shaoyin corresponds to the Heart channel. The Heart is the internal organ ruling internally, while the Small Intestine is the organ ruling externally. The blood of these two channels in women produces milk above and menstrual fluid below, governed by the Chong and Ren channels.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The channels of Chong and Ren originate within the womb. When Yin and Yang are excessive, they harm the networks of the lungs, allowing wind pathogens to enter the lungs through the void. This damages the channels of Chong and Ren, injuring the blood of the Taiyang and Shaoyang, resulting in a mixture of impurities and blood in the lung networks, where cold manifests as more white and heat as more red. Both schools of thought on this matter are incorrect. In treating illness, one must first understand the meridians. In the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; the twelve meridians contain diseases that arise from movement and those that arise from formation. There are twelve main meridians and eight extraordinary vessels. Beyond the twelve meridians, there are these eight extraordinary pathways. Together, the twelve meridians and the eight extraordinary vessels comprise twenty pathways throughout the body, circulating and connecting, flowing continuously day and night in harmony with the heavens. The hand Taiyin lung meridian begins and travels twenty-five degrees in Yang and twenty-five degrees in Yin, ultimately converging back to the hand Taiyin lung meridian. However, among these twenty pathways, only nineteen continuously flow up and down.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The belt vessel begins at the side of the lower abdomen, at the end of the lateral costal region, which corresponds to the Zhuāngmén point. It encircles the body, lacking any source above or below, interweaving around the bladder like a girdle around the body. The Nan Jing states: when there is a disorder in the belt vessel, it feels like sitting in water. The Chong and Ren vessels are like the ocean of meridians, traveling along the abdomen and lateral ribs, flanking the navel, connecting and flowing into the Qi Chong vessel, linked to the belt vessel, which is connected to the Du vessel. The Du vessel arises at the Guan Yuan point, while the Ren vessel governs the nurturing and pregnancy of women. The Du vessel oversees and leads the ocean of female meridians. The Chong, Ren, and Du vessels originate together but travel differently, branching from a single source, all connecting to the belt vessel. The three vessels (Chong, Ren, Du) converge at the Sānhù, encompassing the yin organs, and passing through the orifices of the bladder and other excretory points. The Chong, Ren, and Du vessels are bound by the belt vessel, with the flow of additional meridians traveling up and down, leaving residual heat between the belt vessel.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Heat refers to blood; when blood accumulates without flow for many days, it transforms into fire from metal. Metal, when transformed, becomes white, and it rides the stifled heat in the lower abdomen, resulting in a white fluid that continually flows down with urine, often without pain. If there is pain, it is caused by obstruction, and pain arises from this obstruction. The Inner Canon states that stifled heat in the lower abdomen leads to white liquid in the urine. Stifled heat refers to stagnation; the illness does not originate in the primary channel but is a result of stagnation in other channels causing this ailment. Stagnation can also be interpreted as a guest, suggesting a lingering heat in the lower abdomen. This heat transforms from metal and becomes white. In cases of dysentery with red and white elements, red indicates new accumulation from heart fire, while white indicates old accumulation from lung metal. Therefore, red and white dysentery should not be differentiated based on cold and heat, but rather by the newness or oldness for treatment. If an abscess starts with red blood and later breaks to release white pus, how can this be purely a cold condition? Yet, patients may still doubt this diagnosis.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>Liu Hejian often said this about gold. It is said that when there is much cold, it turns white. To treat dysentery, one can use dried ginger, red vermilion, and peach blossom pills, but even if healed, one will surely develop blood disorders. For conditions like excessive leucorrhea, one should directly use white peony and dried ginger, yet even if the discharge improves, urination will likely remain unbeneficial. Treating diarrhea and leucorrhea should not abruptly employ harsh, hot medicines; doing so will dry up internal fluids, leading to intense thirst. When thirsty, urination becomes difficult, and this can cause swelling in the feet and puffiness in the face, gradually leading to an inability to heal. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires can lead to excessive indulgence, which causes muscle weakness and the release of white substances resembling sperm. Men may suffer from this through urination while women experience a continuous flow. The &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; mentions that when young men are infatuated with older women, like winds falling on mountains, it results in a disorder caused by obsession. This text discusses three insects in one plate known as &quot;gu,&quot; which embodies longing and desires that internally erode. If this erosion becomes severe, one should not immediately attack it with drying and heating medications, for such measures may lead to emaciation and weak pulses, ultimately resulting in death without remedy. Moreover, red and white dysentery indicates that pathogenic heat has transferred to the large intestine, producing red and white discharges. Leucorrhea involves transfer to the small intestine into the bladder meridian, also producing red and white. Therefore, both conditions can be treated together with methods aimed at dampness. First, eliminate the water with pills and the Yuguong powder; next, use gentle formulations to lower heart fire and nourish kidney water, facilitating urination and balancing water pathways, leading to self-healing. Recently, a woman in Qingtunqiu has suffered from continuous leucorrhea, with white substances appearing, for three years now.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The pulse was examined and found to be smooth, large, and strong in both hands, with six to seven beats. The patient often experienced heat, dry mouth, dizziness, and vomiting of sour water. I knew there was indeed cold phlegm in the chest, which was expelled using a treatment that released cold phlegm, yielding two to three liters of sour water, resembling yellow saliva and resembling rotten glue. Next, I used congee to nourish the stomach qi. Then, I employed the treatments of Daoshui and Yugong to purge the lower body. Following this, I used mild medicines to promote drainage of fluids. In just a few days, the patient recovered. I once grasped the principle stated in the Inner Canon: when there is illness above, treat below; when there is illness below, treat above. Moreover, what is above can affect what is below, and vice versa. However, even with this method, one must not be rigid but should consider the specifics of deficiency and excess in treatment. Thus, I understood the selected words from the Sacred Benefits Formula concerning discharge due to wind and cold aligned with the discussions in the works of Chao about red heat and white cold, which directly contradicts the teachings in the Nán and Sù texts.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>I do not dare to casually discuss the teachings of the ancients, fearing that future scholars may not understand them and will inevitably follow them blindly. Take, for instance, those with little knowledge who fail to observe the pulse and breath of a patient, who do not investigate the patient&#39;s meridians, yet rashly diagnose cold and heat. They trust in various harmful medicines, and if something goes wrong, how can they regret their actions afterward? Alas! When a life is lost, can it be revived? Conditions like dysentery and leucorrhea that do not cause death; according to the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; only severe rectal bleeding accompanied by a warm body and heat leads to death. Cases of dysentery with white discharge or conditions related to kidney depletion do not result in death, and if there are fatalities, it is due to the misapplication of medicine.</p>
<p>For female patients suffering from leucorrhea, or those with white discharge resembling fat, one may take Daoshui Pills or Yugong Powder, or simply use Wuyou Powder, adjusting the dosage based on their condition. After purging; then utilize Guiling Pills, Wuling Powder, or Tingli-Muxiang Powder to treat dampness and weakness and to manage diarrhea. Alternatively, using Dusheng Powder can also be effective. This applies equally to maidens.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>On the Wine-Boiled Danggui Pills</strong></p>
<p>When a woman has a flowing white discharge along with symptoms like an aching lower abdomen and leg cramps, she may feel as if she is in extreme cold. Even when heated and covered with thick layers of blanket, she still feels cold to the extreme. Her complexion appears pale and lifeless, like that of a dried fish, and her muscles are thin and sharply defined. </p>
<p>She may experience continuous urination along with the flowing discharge, often unaware of it, her face pallid and eyes dark like withered vegetables. She has poor vision, feels heavy like a mountain, and finds it difficult to walk steadily. Her knees are thin and frail; bowel movements are difficult, and she cannot articulate or muster any strength. </p>
<p>She may also refuse to eat, feeling a sense of heaviness and depression in the chest, unable to bear her suffering. Her complexion may appear dirty, and she may feel a persistent chill in her back. She may have involuntary urination and be unaware of it. All three Yang energies in her body are essentially void and nearly depleted. She may experience constant burping and vomiting, indicative of extreme gastric weakness. </p>
<p>Her pulse may feel deep, tight, and weak, pressing down on it reveals emptiness. If the pulse is large yet weak, it still indicates a cold condition. How much more concerning is it if the pulse feels hollow? A non-pulsating pressure signifies a condition of coldness with extreme deficiency of both Qi and blood. </p>
<p>Thus, it is advisable to prepare the Danggui Pills boiled in wine for substantial nourishment and warmth.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Solid True Pill</strong></p>
<p>Women who have persistent leucorrhea experience cold pain in the lower abdomen; similarly, there is discomfort in the genital area. They see flickering fire in their eyes and have a blurry vision; their teeth feel hot and painful when drinking. The condition requires the use of finely ground yellow root applied externally to alleviate it. Such women prefer dry foods and have an aversion to soups and moist dishes. This illness is caused by cold and dampness invading the internal organs, hence the preference for dry food and aversion to moisture. The yin fire of the liver meridian surges up, causing congestion and flickering fire in the eyes. Kidney water invades the liver and also surges upwards, resulting in poor vision. The dislike for hot drinks is due to the hidden fire in the Yangming meridian. </p>
<p>The treatment method should primarily involve expelling cold and dampness, using pill medication for this purpose. Thus it is said: When cold is in the lower body, treatments should be mild, and soups or dispersing herbs should be avoided. Use wine to prepare white bismuth and dragon bone to dry out the dampness. Toast ginger, which is very hot and pungent, to disperse cold water, and employ the great cold nature of yellow root as the reason and the guide for the treatment. It is said: In ancient times, even with serious crimes, one should not completely sever reproductive capabilities. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is essential to address the root cause and precede the treatment aimed at alleviating the symptoms. The method also involves expelling the discomfort caused by hot drinks. Using Bupleurum as the messenger herb of the meridian, and Peony in a dosage of five parts to guide the treatment; since employing too much hot and pungent medication may harm the liver meridian, it should be done gently. With the spicy warmth of Angelica-Mongolica, it harmonizes the blood vessels, hence it is named Solid True Pill. The method of medication has been thoroughly outlined.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Supplementary Decoction for the Regulation of the Menstrual Flow</strong></p>
<p>What causes persistent white discharge in women with weak and subtle pulse? According to Shu He, prolonged menorrhagia leads to the continual flow of white discharge, which eventually dries up the bone marrow. Long-term loss of blood diminishes yang, resulting in continuous discharge of a slippery nature. This indicates that the blood sea is depleted, and bodily fluids have dwindled, leaving it unable to nourish the muscles and bones. Therefore, the herbs used to harmonize the channels are employed; pungent, sweet, oily herbs are utilized to moisten dryness and replenish fluids. Herbs with strong, warming properties support the yang and promote the blood vessels; bitter, cold herbs are used to drain the lungs and alleviate excessive heat affecting the qi. Ginseng is included for its nourishing properties, supplemented with slightly bitter and warming herbs to enhance the vital energy, thus forming what is called the Supplementary Decoction for the Regulation of the Menstrual Flow. This is the essential medicine for this condition.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong> (Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng)</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For leucorrhea, red corresponds to blood, and white corresponds to qi. The primary treatment should address dampness as a priority. </p>
<p>Both leucorrhea and vaginal discharge are due to phlegm accumulation in the stomach flowing downward, seeping into the bladder, a fact not commonly understood. It is advisable to elevate; in severe cases, one must use leaves to lift the qi. For downward treatment, use Erchen Decoction with added Cangzhu and Baizhu, and still employ the small pills (some texts say &quot;瓦垄子&quot;). </p>
<p>Both red and white discharges are related to blood and arise from the distinction between the large and small intestines. Fat individuals often have excessive damp phlegm, treated with Hai Shi, Banxia, Nansheng, Chao Huanglian, Cangzhu, Chuanxiong, Chunze, and Qingdai among others. </p>
<p>Thin individuals have less white discharge, and when present, it is often due to heat. Treatment involves using Chao Huanglian, Huashi, Chunze, Chuanxiong, Hai Shi, Qingdai among others made into pills. If Hai Shi is not available, clam powder may also be used. </p>
<p>For red and white discharges, options include Shizaotang, Shenyouwan, or Yuzhusan. Strong cases may be treated actively, while weak cases should not be subjected to harsh measures. This is the law of Mr. Luo. </p>
<p>For those with blood deficiency, add or reduce according to Siwu Decoction.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>In cases of Qi deficiency, use ginseng, atractylodes, and dried tangerine peel. For excess moisture, employ solidifying pills for the intestines. When there is movement of heart fire, add a small amount of berberine among all the medicines. For slippery conditions, add dragon bone and redstone resin. For stagnation, add sunflower seeds. Use white sunflower for white discharge and red sunflower for red discharge. For those with a restless nature, add astringent herbs. If phlegm and Qi lead to vaginal discharge, take pills made of atractylodes, cyperus, talc, clam powder, pinellia, and poria. In cases of cold menstruation, add a little dried ginger. Be adaptable and responsive. It is essential to eliminate excessive dampness. </p>
<p>To treat obstructed phlegm and white discharge with a sense of heaviness in the chest, first take the small stomach pill while being half hungry and half full, then take several doses of the medicinal paste. After waiting for the accumulation to dissipate, it is advisable to take tonics. Both red and white discharge arise from emotional distress or depletion of the lower source, which has various causes. Shuhe states that prolonged bleeding can lead to white discharge, and prolonged leakage can lead to the depletion of bone marrow. Indeed, prolonged bleeding decreases blood and diminishes Yang, leading to continuous flow of slippery substances. Dongyuan has elaborated on this; it is crucial to understand this principle. </p>
<p>The treatment for discharge is the same as for nocturnal emissions.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Evidence-Based Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Red and white discharge is caused by emotional disturbances or weakness and coldness of the lower origin, with various underlying factors. Generally, there is more white discharge, with some cases of red discharge. It is advisable to disperse the qi and take the &quot;Zhen Ling Dan&quot; (a tonifying medicine) and also supplement with mugwort and round pills, or to adjust with rice drink mixed with powdered sand ginseng. </p>
<p>If the discharge does not cease and leads to emaciation and weakness, the formula &quot;Four Substances&quot; should be enhanced with half a coin of calcined oyster powder and taken with &quot;Gu Zhen Yuan.&quot; Long-term use is recommended for effectiveness. Some may experience recurring discharge one or two months after recovery, or it may reoccur every six months; starting with blood followed by discharge. If it cannot be stopped, it quickly recurs, this is termed &quot;leaky discharge,&quot; which is the hardest to treat. </p>
<p>Bleeding from the lower section may be relieved. There are cases where weakness due to blood deficiency leads to internal heat penetrating the small intestine, causing painful urination that is colorless and resembles water, or forms sand-like particles. It is not advisable to treat with cold agents; instead, a mix of &quot;Four Substances&quot; and &quot;Wu Ling San&quot; in equal parts should be cooked together for use.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong>【Ming, Li Zhan】</p>
<p><strong>General Principles of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: When the heart and abdomen are affected by stasis of heat and moisture, a white liquid is discharged in urination. This stasis refers to the accumulation of damp heat, which binds within the five organs, passing through the channel to the intestines, resulting in a discharge below, thus referred to as vaginal discharge. Red corresponds to blood, while white corresponds to qi. The symptoms include dizziness, blurred vision, bitterness in the mouth, dryness of the tongue, swelling and dryness in the throat, constipation or diarrhea in the bowels, and cloudy urination, all indicating a heat syndrome. It resembles the conditions of dysentery, but without pain. If pain does occur, it is due to damp heat causing obstruction, and may lead to abdominal pulling pains. Women often consume dried and hot foods, exhibiting erratic behavior, which leads to an overactive liver and a weakened spleen, resulting in damp heat, and the heat then flows throughout. The ancients used specific medicinal formulae, such as the Water-Promoting Pill, followed by gentle diuretics, or adjustments with Bitter Neem Pills or Great Yuanshuo Powder. For abdominal pain, one may temporarily use warming and dispersing methods, such as the Great Warming Channel Decoction, the Supplementing Channel and Firming True Decoction, or the Turtle Shell, Ginger, and Gardenia Pills. Thin individuals often experience heat, with rapid pulses and external signs of irritability, indicating a deficiency of yin and excess of fire, treated with the Huangqin and Cha Pi Pills.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>For those with non-stop discharges, use one tael of ground earth bone bark, five taels of prepared Rehmannia, and ten cups of wine, decoct until three cups remain, and divide into three doses. Alternatively, use Baizhi powder or Dan Yimu pills. </p>
<p>For white discharge accompanied by gout, use Erchen Decoction with Cang, Huangbo, Nuxi, Chuanxiong. If there are also headaches and nasal discharge, use Canghuang Xinqiong powder. If accompanied by emotional disturbances, use Ceyi Huangpi pills. </p>
<p>Fat people tend to have dampness, yellowish complexion, weak pulse, and if the genital area feels icy or painful with white discharge, use Shengyang Zao Shi Decoction or Sìchǎo Gùzhēn pill. </p>
<p>For damp phlegm flowing down and seeping into the bladder, use Erchen Decoction with two types of Atractylodes, Shengma, and Chaihu, or Cang Huang Huangpi pills. If there is thick phlegm white discharge that does not cease, first take Xiao Wei pill while half hungry and half full, then take a few pills of Jǐngyù. </p>
<p>For general use, combine Wulingsan with Siwu Decoction; or grind Dan Huangpi into a powder and mix with wine to form pills. If blood is deficient, add Siwu Decoction; for qi deficiency, add Renshen, Atractylodes, and Chenpi; if there is fiery movement, add Huangbo; for prolonged dampness, add Longgu and Chishizhi; if the nature is dry, add Huanglian; for abdominal pain, consider as if it were dry ginger.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Due to continuous dripping from the moon and water, there may be sudden collapse or excessive blood loss after childbirth, leading to deficiency of yin and depletion of yang, causing the vital energy to fail to rise, meridians to weep, defensive qi to sink, and essence to stagnate in the lower region, resulting in accumulation. If it flows down like smooth liquid and is foul-smelling, use Huangqi Jianzhong Decoction minus cinnamon and add Angelica, then decoct and swallow with bitter woe pills. If it doesn&#39;t stop and causes cold pain in the lower abdomen, use Dongyuan Guchen Pills. If there is deficiency with internal heat, use Yujing Guchen Decoction or Da Wujie Pills regularly. For qi deficiency, use Si Junzi Decoction; for blood deficiency, use Si Wu Decoction. If there is heat, add Huangbo; if there is cold, add cinnamon or Aconite.</p>
<p>Initially caused by blood loss, followed by loss of yang leads to extreme deficiency of yang qi, resulting in foul-smelling discharges, often accompanied by sadness and lack of joy, use the Fuguo Decoction. For abdominal pain with coldness, use Si Wu Decoction plus cinnamon and Aconite. Regularly use wine-cooked Angelica Pills, Xiao Wujie Pills, Chongshi Pills, and Amber Menstruation Pills.</p>
<p>When wind pathogens enter through the vaginal or affect the meridians, they can circulate through the organs: if the liver meridian is injured, it appears green like muddy water; if the heart meridian is injured, it appears red like bloody fluid; if the lung meridian is injured, it resembles white mucus; if the spleen meridian is damaged, it appears yellow like rotten melon; if the kidney meridian is harmed, it appears black like nosebleed. It would be appropriate to use Stomach Wind Decoction or Wujisan with the main ingredient of Ephedra. The single Diyu Powder is commonly used.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>When a maiden first experiences menstruation, she may feel sudden anxiety; some bathe in cold water or cool themselves in the wind, which can lead to menstrual cessation and subsequently to leukorrhea. For this condition, it is advisable to use a formula of amber and red cinnabar pills. </p>
<p>For pregnant women with leukorrhea, which is caused entirely by damp heat, the mixture of Huangqin (Scutellaria), Zhuru (Ziziphus), and Chupi (Ailanthus) pills is recommended. </p>
<p>When yin and yang are imbalanced in usual circumstances, and due to blood loss postpartum leading to deficiency, wind evil may invade the womb. In this case, one should take warming uterine pills with ginger and Aconite, or a formula of Huangqi (Astragalus) and Jianzhong decoction minus cinnamon but added with Angelica, and stew it with bitter neem pills.</p>
<p>In general, for leukorrhea, one can either elevate and tonify with a formula like Shengyang Tiaojing decoction or consolidate with a treatment such as Fulonggan powder or Baizhi powder. However, if symptoms temporarily cease but then return, it is primarily due to the protective system&#39;s opening and closing, which governs the essence of blood. The spleen and stomach serve as the sea for blood and liquid; when both Wei qi and Stomach qi are deficient, blood fluid cannot be properly regulated. </p>
<p>Thus, ancient methods propose using Guizhi decoction with Aconite to strengthen defensive qi, or Sijunzi decoction combined with Caoguo (Amomum), cloves, and Mu Xiang to dry fluids and tonify the spleen. One may also use Liguang decoction with Chenpi (tangerine peel) and Banxia (Pinellia), or simply Banxia pills prepared with Chuanqiong decoction; or Baizhongyqi decoction and Pingwei powder, all of which replenish and strengthen the Wei and the spleen, allowing qi and blood to flow normally rather than overly focusing on consolidation which could lead to depletion.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a condition termed &quot;white profusion,&quot; resembling the appearance of white essence, which should not be mistaken for leukorrhea and should not be treated with excessive hot medicines.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>For leukorrhea and vaginal bleeding, if the pulse is mostly floating and fluctuating, it indicates a deficiency; if it is a solid count, it signifies heaviness. A floating and slow kidney pulse indicates issues related to dampness in the vagina.</p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Records</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji) </p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Leukorrhea in women may arise from external influences or emotional disturbances, from indulgence in excess food, or from the use of drying agents. This leads to the depletion of the spleen and stomach, causing the yang energy to sink, or results from damp phlegm accumulation. Therefore, it is referred to as leukorrhea. In such cases, the treatment should primarily focus on strengthening the spleen and stomach and elevating yang energy, supplemented by medicinal herbs that correspond with various meridians.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> 【Ming - Wang Kentang】</p>
<p><strong>On Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>For women with abnormal vaginal discharge, it is a serious condition that can prevent childbirth, and prompt treatment is necessary. This is noted from the story of Bian Que passing through Handan, where he heard of a noblewoman specifically needing treatment for her discharge. There are three types of symptoms associated with vaginal discharge: For unmarried girls, if menstruation begins and is suddenly interrupted by bathing in cold water or being fanned in a warm room or exposed to the wind, this leads to the maiden&#39;s illness discharge. For married women, excessive yin and yang can damage the vessels, allowing wind pathogens to invade. If the vessels are exposed to cold, impure fluids mix with blood and flow down. Postpartum discharge occurs due to loss of blood and energy, which harms the vessels; when the door of the body is open to external wind, the body is weak, allowing cold wind to enter, causing a combination of wind and heat, leading to fluid discharge. Cold tends to produce more white discharge, while heat leads to more red; when cold and heat interact, both red and white are discharged.</p>
<p><strong>On Ancient Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>For discharge accompanied by pain and stasis in the lower abdomen, first administer the Ten Jujube Decoction, followed by bitter tree pills and Dayuan Hu powder. This follows the principle of attacking first and supplementing after, which should not be overlooked. For phlegm-related white discharge, use the Small Stomach Pill, taken when half-starved and half-full, taking a few pills to reduce accumulation, then take one tael of Atractylodes macrocephala, half a tael of Atractylodes, two and a half quarters of red and white sunflower, and seven and a half qian of white peony, all made into pills with steamed flour, and take twenty pills in the morning with Four Substances Decoction to supplement.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Method for Drying Dampness</strong></p>
<p>If there is phlegm-dampness accompanied by weakness that does not tolerate attacks, dry it out. For heat and dampness, it&#39;s suitable to use cool dryness; for cold dampness, it&#39;s appropriate to use warm dryness.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Moistening Dried-Up Conditions</strong></p>
<p>For long-standing conditions that have dried up, moisten them. Generally, when heavily supplementing qi and blood, the goal is to moisten, such as using Si Wu Decoction as powder, forming honey pills the size of nuts, and taking three to four dozen with a light rice drink, to treat elderly women with white discharge. These are all moistening agents.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Nourishing Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>In cases where the pulse is weak and appetite is diminished, or in cases of prolonged illness that have been previously purged, all should be treated for deficiency. If there is heat, use cool tonics; if there is no heat, use warm tonics.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Sour Grass</strong></p>
<p>In &quot;Qian Jin,&quot; the treatment for red and white discharge uses three-leaved sour grass dried into powder, taken with wine. The leaves of this grass are as fine as duckweed, grow in clusters, and the stems end with three leaves, commonly known as cuckoo rice. The term &quot;cuckoo&quot; refers to the bird that frequently eats it, hence it is also called dove sour grass. &quot;Yan Yi&quot; mentions a bitter fruit that resembles a kumquat, which is sour and edible, thus it is named sour soup, but it does not have three leaves. The small sour grass spreads along the ground with three-lobed leaves, only producing yellow flowers, and both the stems and leaves are sour.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Causes of Pus Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>In cases of leucorrhea accompanied by pus in the intestines, continuous dripping occurs, with an especially foul odor. This leads to increased cold pain in the navel and abdomen, which is mainly caused by pus and blood. There are no set periods for treatment; the first step must be to expel the pus. Use one tael of angelica dahurica, two taels of the root of Malva neglecta, half a tael each of white peony root and alum (the alum should be burned to dryness and then ground separately). Mix the rest into a powder, make into pills the size of a tung nut with wax, and take ten or fifteen pills before meals with rice wine. Once the pus has been cleared, follow with complementary tonic herbs.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Formulas Examined</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wu Kun]</p>
<p><strong>On the Use of Angelica Dahurica, Fructus Viticis, and Wanglong Powder</strong></p>
<p>Leucorrhea arises from damp heat in the stomach, similar to urine being deposited in a receptacle, leading to a specific kind of discharge. Ancient famous physicians have used solely roasted angelica dahurica, solely roasted viticis fruit, or solely Wanglong powder in their treatments. The nature of angelica dahurica is fragrant and uplifting; that of viticis fruit is pungent and promotes qi; and Wanglong&#39;s nature is drying and overcomes dampness. Roasting them enhances their transformative powers—fire generates earth, which can ward off water; refining and grinding makes it dry enough to overcome dampness, and thus prevent downward flow and cease leucorrhea. This is the intention behind using these three ingredients.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Sunflower</strong></p>
<p>All people have a belt channel located between the waist and navel, which is one of the eight extraordinary vessels. It circles around like a waistband. If the lower burner is deficient and the governing and directing vessels are impaired, then the qi and blood of the middle burner invade from below, becoming trapped beneath the belt channel. When this happens, a qi condition is indicated by white discharge, while a blood condition is indicated by red discharge, referred to as &quot;red and white discharges.&quot;</p>
<p>Dongyuan states: white sunflower treats white discharge, while red sunflower treats red discharge. The red treats blood dryness, while the white treats qi dryness; what does this mean? Kun refers to sunflower as the calyx of morning sun, endowed with the yin of plants, encompassing the yang of heaven and earth. Thus, it can moisten dryness and elevate the yang, allowing the nutritive and protective qi to rise, preventing it from becoming trapped beneath the belt channel and resulting in discharge.</p>
<p>Someone may ask: if the disease of discharge is indeed this, what is the point of saying that excess damp-heat in the stomach can lead to discharge? I respond: for women who are otherwise healthy but have only white discharge, it is attributed to damp-heat descending. For women with prolonged illness, where both red and white discharges occur, this is due to the sinking of qi and blood, often leading to tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a notion that white discharge is associated with cold and red discharge with heat; how can this be understood? I respond: I have seen cases where those with cold can have red discharge, and those with heat can have increased white discharge. This notion of white as cold and red as heat is insufficiently convincing. If this were the case, then would the occurrence of both red and white discharges indicate the presence of both cold and heat? The teachings on this matter do not align with that interpretation.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Use of White Horse Hair and its Relation to Medicine</strong></p>
<p>When qi is trapped in the lower region, it results in a white discharge; when blood is trapped there, it results in a red discharge. If astringent herbs are used to stop this, the lingering discharge persists and does not resolve. If a laxative herb is used, it not only damages the interior but also harms the lower region, and neither approach is a proper treatment. </p>
<p>The white horse possesses the strength of its hair, and the hair derives from blood. The surplus blood can stabilize blood circulation, and the firmness of the hair can relieve qi. Stabilizing blood will stop the red discharge, while invigorating qi will resolve the white discharge. This is the purpose of utilizing horse hair. </p>
<p>The turtle, soft-shelled turtle, and oyster are hard on the outside but soft on the inside, symbolizing separation. By removing their softness and using their hardness, they can transform conditions and stabilize qi. Transformation of conditions means that the resulting discharges of red and white will no longer remain trapped. Stabilizing qi ensures that the nutritive and defensive energies do not descend into the lower region. When the nutritive energy does not descend, there will be no red discharge; when the defensive energy does not descend, there will be no white discharge.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Summary of the Extensive Succession Records</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wanquan)</p>
<p><strong>On Discharge</strong></p>
<p>The blood of women is referred to as &quot;the seven losses.&quot; The upper aspect produces milk, while the lower aspect corresponds to menstruation. The fluids related to intercourse and the discharges during conditions of leakage and profuse bleeding are all considered blood of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Female Secret Pathologies</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wanquan)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Disorders related to discharges are common among women. Red discharges suggest heat and are treated with a combination of tonifying and heat-clearing methods. White discharges indicate dampness and are treated with remedies for deficiency and phlegm. For cases persisting for many years, the focus should be on tonifying the spleen and stomach, along with methods to lift and strengthen. Generally, lean individuals tend to have more heat, while heavier individuals accumulate phlegm.</p>
<p><strong>Medicinal Formulations Required</strong></p>
<p>For red discharges, use the Four Substance Decoction with added Scutellaria and Lian Qiao, along with Sheng Ma and Dan Pi as the main ingredients, and also take San Bu Wan. For white discharges, the modified Six Gentleman Decoction serves as the chief remedy, supplemented with Cang Sha Pearls to guide phlegm. For persistent discharges, it is advisable to take Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction, removing Rehmannia and adding Chen Pi, Ban Xia, and roasted dry ginger, alongside Ren Shen Xu and Da Bu Wan to strengthen the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, as well as using Bu Gong Wan to stabilize the lower source.</p>
<p><strong>Difference between White Discharge and Leucorrhea</strong></p>
<p>The white discharge in women differs from leucorrhea and white turbidity diseases in both symptomatology and treatment protocols. The white discharge is characterized by a continuous flow, being clear, cold, thick, and sticky, indicating deficiency of the lower source. This should be treated with methods used for discharges that persist for long periods, unlike white turbidity, which is muddy and appears in conjunction with urination.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>On Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Although women&#39;s leucorrhea may seem minimal, it is essentially of the same nature. It arises because of the subtlety of the discharge and its severity. This is mainly due to the instability of the Mingmen (the life gate), and the causes for this instability can be categorized into six: </p>
<p>Firstly, the fluctuation caused by the heart&#39;s disturbance; when the heart is unsettled, it affects the Mingmen, causing it to lose its protective function—this is due to excessive ambition. Secondly, the slide of excessive desires; when emotions are unrestrained and indulgence knows no limits, the essence flows and the Mingmen fails to contain it—this is due to excessive satisfaction. Thirdly, the discord in the marital chamber; in the relations between men and women, there is a difference in timing; this imbalance often yields to male desires, leading to female emotions being stifled. When there is a halt, it results in stagnation, then muddiness and leucorrhea occur—this issue of satisfaction is what women experience the most yet rarely voice.</p>
<p>Among the three factors outlined, the causes of leucorrhea predominantly stem from these, with about eight or nine cases out of ten. To treat them, it is essential to clarify the source of each cause for effective results. However, the source may not be readily clear, and since it can be instantly triggered, the effects of medicine cannot easily contend with emotional stirrings—this is why leucorrhea is not easily treated. </p>
<p>Besides these three causes, there are also damp-heat flow downward, virtual coldness leading to instability, and deficiencies in the spleen and kidneys that fail to manage properly. Each issue should be addressed according to its specific symptoms.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is restless, and there is a flow of discharges due to unsteady heart fire, it is necessary to first clear the fire. It is advisable to use calming medicine such as Zhu Sha An Shen Wan, Qing Xin Lian Zi Yin, or Zhi Zhi Gu Jing Wan, among others. </p>
<p>In the case of a lack of evil fire and merely seeing a weak heart with discharges, it is suitable to use medicine like Mi Yuan Jian, Ren Shen Wan, Xin Xu Bai Zhuo Yin, and Fu Ling Wan, etc.</p>
<p>If there is excessive desire leading to slippery discharge that is not firm, one should use Mi Yuan Jian, Shou Pi Jian, Gu Yin Jian, Ling Zhu Tu Si Wan, Ji Sheng Gu Jing Wan, Lock Jing Wan, or Jin Suo Si Xian Dan, among others.</p>
<p>For individuals experiencing stagnation in their activities, where the essence flows back and becomes turbid, it is best to begin with Liu Wei Di Huang Tang or Wei Xi Wan to aid it; if it continues for a long time, Gu Yin Jian or Ling Zhu Tu Si Wan should be used to strengthen it.</p>
<p>If there is damp-heat flowing down causing turbid discharges, the pulse must be slippery and rapid, with a red hue present, along with symptoms of thirst and heat; in such cases, Bao Yin Jian or a modified Xiao Yao San should be taken. In severe heat with redness and painful urination, Long Dan Xie Gan Tang is recommended.</p>
<p>If the original energy is weak, causing discharges, the following remedies are appropriate: Shou Pi Jian, Gu Yin Jian, Tu Si Jian, Qi Fu Yin, Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, or Jiu Long Wan, among others.</p>
<p>In cases of weak Yang energy and cold, where the pulse is fine and weak, the complexion is pale and cool, and the abdomen often feels cold, it is advised to add ginger and Fu Zi or use Homegrown Chives Pills.</p>
<p>For individuals with spleen and kidney Qi deficiency leading to excessive discharge, it is best to use Shou Pi Jian, Gu Yin Jian, Gui Pi Tang, or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, among others.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Prescription</strong></p>

Another method: If white discharge persists, gradually like a worm, take the Qugu and Chengyin points at seven-tenths each; Zhongji at six-tenths, with the points located beneath the lateral bones. Treat red discharge as per the method. Another method: The four flowers point is remarkably effective for treating red and white discharge.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>In &quot;Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety,&quot; it is stated: The wife of Li Zuoya from Xicheng suffered from a discharge like water, continuous and unending, with an unbearable foul odor. She had a pale complexion and had reduced her food intake for three years. The physicians all diagnosed her condition as due to accumulated cold. They prescribed various herbs including stone, sulfur, ginger, and others, aiming to dry and replenish her, but the discharge only increased. She frequently changed her clothes due to the condition. </p>
<p>One remedy suggested involved taking ten pounds of charcoal, placing the herbs in a crucible, sealing it with salt mud, and maintaining continuous charcoal heat for three days and nights until it turned completely red, thus creating a medicine known as Water Dragon Pill, which she took in large quantities, but the discharges worsened. Cautiously, the physician Dairen concluded that this was a case of severe dampness caused by heat impacting the channels of the sun; that is, the cold water was overwhelming. Since water flows downward from high to low, it is essential to cut off the source above. </p>
<p>The patient released two to three liters of thick fluid, and the next day expelled more than ten streams of muddy water. After three rounds of vigorous sweating, by dawn, the patient reported that the foul discharge had ceased. Subsequently, she was given a cold and cooling remedy, and after half a year, she gave birth to a son. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that when there is heat in the lower abdomen, white fluid is discharged. The condition resembles sitting in water. Therefore, treating abnormal discharges is similar to treating dampness, requiring the expulsion of water and facilitating urination. Do not regard red as hot and white as cold. Liu Hejian&#39;s writings elaborate on this matter thoroughly.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>Recently, there was a woman in Dongqiu who suffered from continuous vaginal discharge, a white fluid, for three years. I was asked to take her pulse. Upon diagnosing her wrists, the pulses felt smooth, large, and strong, with six or seven beats, and she often experienced heat in her body, dry mouth, dizziness, and occasional vomiting of sour fluid. I suspected she had cold phlegm in her chest, and used a remedy to expel cold phlegm, yielding two to three liters of fluid, mostly sour water, with some resembling yellow saliva and appearing like rotting glue. Next, I employed congee to nourish her stomach qi, then used methods to guide water and apply draining techniques to clear her lower body. After administering diuretic medicines that promote fluid drainage for several days, she was cured.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Danxi Heart Methods,&quot; it is stated: A Hu&#39;an woman suffers from excessive vaginal discharge, abundant menstrual flow, little appetite, fatigue, a pale face, and blood-like clots or membranous substances in her menstruation. I recommended using ginseng, atractylodes, and other tonics to replenish blood and qi, balancing the spleen and stomach; eventually, all symptoms diminished, but the discharge persisted, for which I prescribed Chupi Pills, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Cases,&quot; one widowed woman presented with abdominal distension and pain in her sides, internal heat, afternoon fevers, irregular menstruation, and limbs that felt sore and numb, with sporadic phlegm. Initially, I used medicines to clear qi and transform phlegm, but her throat felt constricted, and she had a bluish-yellow discharge with abdominal distension. When I applied agents to move qi, her chest felt uncomfortably full, and her limbs remained numb. This condition was due to emotional distress harming her liver and spleen. I administered Guizhi Spleen Decoction in the morning to relieve spleen depression and strengthen spleen qi, followed by Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder in the evening to nourish liver blood and clear liver fire. After over a hundred doses, she was cured.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>A woman experienced coughing and phlegm, with a feeling of fullness in the chest and wheezing. She found some relief after eating but suffered from excessive discharge for over twenty years, unresponsive to various medications. This was due to deficiency of qi and phlegm. As the phlegm decreased, the discharge resolved itself. Therefore, she took Liu Jun Zi Tang in the morning and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan in the evening, and within a month, she saw improvement.</p>
<p>Another woman had tinnitus and a feeling of fullness in the chest, with internal heat and dry mouth. She felt as though there was a lump in her throat, and swallowing was difficult. Her menstrual cycles were irregular, and she also had discharge. I diagnosed her with liver and spleen stagnation and prescribed Gui Pi Tang, adding Ban Xia, Shan Zhi, Sheng Ma, and Chai Hu. Alternating with Si Qi Tang and taking white pills, she recovered.</p>
<p>A different woman experienced sourness in her throat, fullness after eating, a reduced appetite, and diarrhea. Her menstrual cycle was irregular. She took Qing Qi Hua Tan Wan, but then her knees swelled gradually, with alternating chills and fever, yellow-white discharge, facial weakness, and body fatigue. This indicated deficiency in both spleen and stomach, with damp phlegm downward. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, increasing the amount of Ren Shen and Bai Zhu, and added Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and Pao Jiang, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman had discharge and weakness in her limbs. I stated: &quot;The limbs correspond to the earth element.&quot; This indicated weakness in the spleen and stomach, with damp phlegm downward. I treated her with Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Ji Sheng Gui Pi, resulting in her recovery.</p>
<p>Lastly, a woman had yellow-white discharge, and when angry, she felt obstructed in the chest. She had reduced appetite and thought processes. I considered using herbs to disperse and regulate qi, yet she experienced phlegm, chest fullness, and bloody stools. I diagnosed this as due to deficiency of spleen qi, preventing it from absorbing and returning blood to the source. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi, adding Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and Pao Jiang in four doses, and also added Ba Zhen Tang with Chai Hu and Shan Zhi, leading to her healing.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>A woman over sixty years old experienced internal heat and dry mouth. When fatigued, she had headaches, phlegm, and discharge. Attempts to resolve phlegm and promote Qi made her symptoms worse, leading to reduced appetite and occasional numbness in her limbs. After taking remedies to dispel wind and resolve phlegm, she continued to feel numbness in her limbs, with her hands and feet alternating between being cold and hot, and she gradually became emaciated. I said: This condition is due to weak spleen Qi, which cannot nourish the lungs. The wind-dispelling remedies further harm the meridians, so it is necessary to nourish the source of digestion. I then prescribed over twenty doses of a formula to tonify the middle and augment Qi, adding Poria, Pinellia, and roasted ginger. Her spleen Qi gradually improved, her appetite increased, and all symptoms quickly resolved.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: The wife of Xue Weng, aged over thirty, had eighteen pregnancies, with nine stillbirths and eight deaths in infancy. After being overly shocked and worried due to an event, she became confused and unaware of her surroundings, with sores on her mouth, lips, and tongue. At times, she nearly choked, suffering from lower body weakness and a profuse white discharge for over forty days. Occasionally, she became slightly aware, to the point of wanting to hang herself, feeling unable to bear the illness. When some cold remedies were given to address her upper symptoms, her lower condition worsened. Attempts to use hot remedies and steam treatments on her lower body only aggravated the heat. Four of her brothers checked her pulse and realized it was a case of Yang deficiency. In urgency, they prepared nine qian of processed Aconite boiled with salt as the main ingredient, with mint and Saposhnikovia as assistants, along with ginger, cinnamon, Chuanxiong, and angelica. They decocted it with cool spring water and gave it to her. After just a few doses, she fell into a deep sleep, breathing steadily through the night, and upon waking, she could recognize people. At that time, she had one son and two daughters, who held onto each other and wept, with everyone filled with sorrow.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>Zhao Xianchang, a close friend, exclaimed: &quot;What technique is this?&quot; The disciple replied: &quot;It is mentioned in the medical texts; we use false against false and true against true. Thus, since the upper part is falsely hot, we treat it with a false cold medicine; since the lower part is truly cold, we counter it with a truly hot medicine. This way, the upper and lower parts harmonize and the illness resolves.&quot; </p>
<p>Following the former ruler, I used a female elixir of gold and combined it with various prescriptions, which not only cured the ailments but also balanced the vital energy. In the year of Gengwu, a son was born, and in Ren Shen, another son was born. Last year, I also suffered from intermittent fever for thirteen months; I relied on nourishing the vital energy and regulating the life force. After a substantial intake of food, I then countered it with toxic medicine, resulting in significant purging with much vomit and stool. Afterwards, I administered three qian of aconite soup and he recovered. </p>
<p>Effectiveness was not tied to the morning or evening. The elixir used was indeed superior to the golden pills obtained from extraordinary sources. By increasing the amount of cyperus and examining the imbalances of qi and blood, I also added turmeric and various herbs akin to gentian, which yielded significant results. </p>
<p>I pondered that those without children often face such hardships, and reflecting on how difficult it is for me to have children, I felt the bitterness of it. Thus, I sequentially documented my methods, including the female elixir of gold, to assist others.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>Tao Zundao&#39;s external aunt, aged seventy, was slender and had a good appetite. She suffered from a white discharge and, before meals, would take ginger soup and swallow large doses of pills, around ninety to a hundred, one to two times. After lunch, when resting, she would take fifteen small stomach pills and was cured.</p>
<p>A woman, after childbirth, experienced weakness from cold, nausea, inability to eat, and abdominal pain as if being cut. She had intermittent chills and fever, excessive sweating at night, was emaciated and bony, with a hard mass the size of a palm on the left side of her navel, which was cool to the touch. Despite the hot summer, there was no sweating in that area, and any movement caused unbearable pain. Many remedies had no effect. In a dream, someone suddenly handed her a recipe for moxa pill decoction. After taking it, her nausea, chills, and night sweat ceased, and after consuming one dose, she returned to normal, but the blood clot remained unchanged. After taking five or six doses, the mass naturally dissolved and emerged like fish gelatin.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diagnosis of Leucorrhea Disease</strong></p>
<p>Women’s ailments arise from a deficiency that causes cold accumulation and blocked qi, leading to the disruption of the menstrual flow over many years, resulting in cold and blood stagnation at the gate of the womb. Cold injures the meridians, becoming hardened above, causing vomiting of saliva and phlegm, which over time can develop into lung abscesses, damaging the body&#39;s vitality. In the middle abdomen, there may be a cold hernia around the navel, or pain in the flanks connected to the organs, or a binding of heat within causing pain in the lower abdomen, with a pulse that is rapid without sores. The skin may appear like fish scales, and these symptoms can also manifest in men, not only in women. </p>
<p>In the lower abdomen, symptoms aren&#39;t pronounced, the menstrual cycle is irregular, leading to painful pulling in the genitals, coldness in the lower abdomen, or radiating pain in the lower back and spine. The qi is in upheaval, causing rapid, intense pain, knee and shin discomfort, sudden dizziness or faintness resembling syncope, and emotional distress characterized by worry and excessive anger. All these symptoms are aspects of leucorrhea and are not the result of supernatural beings. Over time, there may be emaciation, a weak pulse with much cold, reflecting the complexity of thirty-six diseases and myriad variations. </p>
<p>Careful examination of the pulse on both yin and yang, and distinguishing between deficiency and excess, allows for precise treatment with acupuncture and herbal medicine, ensuring safety in critical situations. Although the same disease may present, the pulses may differ; therefore, one must distinguish and take note, lest one claims otherwise. </p>
<p>A question was asked: A woman aged fifty has experienced profuse discharges for several days without cessation, with evening fevers, urgent sensations in the lower abdomen, fullness in the belly accompanied by heat in the palms, and dryness of the lips and mouth. Why is this? The teacher replied: This ailment is related to leucorrhea. Why is that? It has been chronic after a partial delivery, where stagnant blood remains in the lower abdomen. How can we know? The sign of dry lips and mouth indicates this. One should treat with Warm Meridians Decoction. If the menstrual circulation is obstructed, with fullness and pain in the lower abdomen, and it persists for a month, then Earth Gourd Root Powder should be the prescription.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pulse Classics</strong> (by Wang Shuhe from the Jin Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Evidence</strong></p>
<p>When the great wind evil enters the Lesser Yin, a woman experiences a white discharge that turns red. The master said: In women, the six major diseases of discharge, if the pulse is floating, it indicates intestinal rumbling and abdominal fullness; if it is tight, it signifies abdominal pain; if it is rapid, it suggests itching in the Yin area; if it is surging, it leads to sores; if it is wiry, it indicates painful pulls in the Yin area. The master said: Discharge has three gates: the first is the womb gate, the second is the dragon gate, and the third is the jade gate. For those who have given birth, it pertains to the womb gate; for those who haven&#39;t given birth, it relates to the dragon gate; unmarried girls correspond to the jade gate. </p>
<p>When asked: What are the three diseases of women who have not yet been through the door? The master said: The first disease occurs when menstruation first begins, with heat in the Yin area, sometimes in the wind or when fanned; the second disease may arise from washing with cold water; the third disease may come from a shock or fright, leading to discharge. The master said: In women&#39;s discharge, there are nine substantial matters. For instance, if afflicted by the disease of rat&#39;s milk, the symptoms are severe and sudden, with a specific period indicated by the heavenly stems and earthly branches. The rest follow this pattern.</p>
<p>When asked: There is a woman aged fifty who suffers only from back pain, experiences occasional abdominal pain, dislikes food, is prone to bloating, and her pulse is weak with a tight guan and chi, the superficial pulse not corresponding. I wish to know what you say. The master said: One should inquire about the patient&#39;s eating habits. If she says she does not want to eat or smells a foul grain scent, then the disease is in the upper jiao.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a patient says they have little desire to eat, and can do without food, the illness is in the middle burner. If a patient says they eat and drink as usual, the illness is in the lower burner. If the illness belongs to leukorrhea, it should be treated accordingly. </p>
<p>A question was asked: If a woman suffers from a condition like epilepsy with many episodes in a day, and the teacher checks her pulse, finding it exhibits leukorrhea as mentioned, what type of pulse is this, and how can it be differentiated? The teacher replied: The cun pulse is soft yet tight. Softness indicates weak yang, while tightness indicates cold in the channels. With weak yang and a deficiency in protective qi, the blood is exhausted and congealed with cold. Yin and yang are imbalanced, and evil qi takes refuge in the protective network. </p>
<p>The illness may arise from an early onset of menstruation due to engaging in intimate relations, leading to excessive strain. This causes the essence to affect the life gate, resulting in blood deficiency from menstrual loss, causing the channels to engorge. The central cavity feels the movement of yang, and a slight breeze causes cold to arise, leaving the protective network vacated, leading to cold accumulation in the lower abdomen. This triggers an upward thrust, rushing to the chest cavity, where fluids are obstructed, overflowing with saliva and drool, presenting symptoms like dizziness and syncope. The qi surges in the hips creating heat, which is commonly referred to as epilepsy by inexperienced doctors, but burning moxibustion can exacerbate the condition.</p>
<p>When diagnosing a woman with bleeding that is red and white, if the blood flow is frequent, a rapid pulse indicates death; a slower pulse suggests survival. </p>
<p>For a woman with persistent bleeding that is red and white, a pulse that is small and weak indicates survival, while a tight, rapid pulse suggests death. </p>
<p>For women experiencing leukorrhea, if the pulse is floating and there is a strong aversion to cold with ongoing leakage, it is not advisable to treat.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Women&#39;s Health Remedies - By Chen Ziming (Song Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five Types of Discharge</strong></p>
<p>For women, there are five types of discharge. This occurs due to the invasion of wind pathogens into the womb after menstruation or childbirth, affecting the organs. If the liver channel (foot Jueyin) is injured, the discharge appears dark green; if the heart channel (hand Shaoyin) is affected, it looks like red drool; if the lung channel (hand Taiyin) is harmed, it resembles nasal mucus; if the spleen channel (foot Taiyin) is involved, it appears yellow like rotten melon; if the kidney channel (foot Shaoyin) is damaged, it looks black like stagnant blood. </p>
<p>There exists a channel called the &quot;Dai Mai&quot; that runs horizontally around the waist, resembling a belt, and diseases arise from this, hence the name &quot;Dai.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to Mr. Xu Yongcheng, the white discharge is linked to qi and the red is connected to blood. Mr. Dongyuan states that prolonged blood loss can lead to yang deficiency. Therefore, a white, slippery substance that flows down does not necessarily confine to the Dai channel; it may also involve damp phlegm descending to the lower burner, excess yin from the kidney and liver, or downward flow caused by shock and fear leading to turbid fluids, or emotional distress causing muscle weakness. </p>
<p>For those with six pulses that are slippery, strong, and large, one should use methods to promote and guide this discharge; this can be considered as purging. Dongyuan suggests if the pulse is thin, deep, tight, or large and empty, one should tonify yang and regulate menstruation, addressing the underlying deficiency as well.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Danxi used substances like haishi (seawater stone), nansheng (south star), and the bark of the chinquapin root to treat damp phlegm. I humbly suggest that for prior syndromes, it is essential to strengthen the spleen and stomach, primarily boosting yang qi, while assisting with medications from various channels according to symptoms. For symptoms represented by the color blue, which relates to the liver, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with山栀 (huangzhī) and 防风 (fangfeng); for damp-heat stagnation with red, painful urination, use Long Dan Cao Decoction to clear the liver; if liver blood is insufficient or there is dryness-heat or wind-heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For the color red, which belongs to the heart, utilize Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with huanglian, 山栀, and danggui; if thinking and worry have been excessive, employ Miaoxiang San and other medications. For the color white, which is associated with the lungs, adopt Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with 山栀. For the color yellow, which pertains to the spleen, use Liu Jun Zi Decoction with 山栀 and Chai Hu; if it does not respond, apply Gui Pi Decoction. For the color black, connecting to the kidneys, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If both qi and blood are deficient, take Ba Zhen Tang. If yang qi is sinking, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If damp phlegm has descended, augment the previous decoction with Fu Ling, Ban Xia, Cang Zhu, and Huang Mi. For qi deficiency and phlegm fluid descent, use Si Qi Tang to complement Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. One should not insist that fat people have more phlegm while thin people have more heat, and lightly treat them with drying dampness and clearing heat medications.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Jisheng Fang - Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Sources of the Chao Clan&#39;s Diseases,&quot; there are thirty-six ailments specific to women. Among those, seven symptoms, eight masses, and twelve types of vaginal discharge are mentioned. However, the so-called twelve types of vaginal discharge do not explicitly describe their symptoms. The prevalent conditions today are merely red and white discharges. Analyzing their origins, it results from excessive strain, dysfunction of the Chong and Ren channels, and the invasion of wind and cold in the uterus, which is the cause of these illnesses.</p>
<p>Additionally, during ordinary times, a woman&#39;s blood should be abundant, while her qi should be relatively less, which implies that proper qi supports health and prevents diseases. If, by chance, the qi exceeds the blood, it produces cold, and the blood fails to transform into a red state, thus resulting in a white discharge. Conversely, if the qi is balanced but the blood is insufficient, the blood generates heat, and when it fails to transform into a red state, it causes a red discharge. When cold and heat combine, both red and white discharges may occur.</p>
<p>For unmarried women or those who have given birth and suffer from these ailments, it can lead to issues with conceiving, leading to infertility. Anyone exhibiting these symptoms should seek treatment promptly. If left untreated for long, it can result in a dark complexion, emaciation of the muscles, abdominal and flank distension, painful stabbing sensations; and even the limbs may become thin and cold, causing extreme discomfort and inability to eat.</p>
<p>When diagnosing the pulse, if the right wrist’s pulse is floating, it signifies yang, and when yang is depleted, it indicates an inability to conceive, often accompanied by cold feet and vaginal discharge.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion and Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Red conditions heat into the small intestine, while white conditions heat into the large intestine. Fundamentally, they are both due to damp-heat stagnating in the channels, leading to an overabundance of fluids, which manifests as red and white discharges. There is initially no pain from the stagnation, but due to the deficiency in the five channels, the accumulated heat becomes constricted in the belt channel. Thus, women experience continuous pain below the navel, and sometimes discharges from the genitalia. Hence the classic states: the Ren channel is affected; men may have seven types of internal accumulations, while women deal with discharges and accumulations from the belt channel. Wang&#39;s commentary states: the Ren channel runs from above the womb over the belt channel, connecting above the navel. Therefore, men face internal accumulations of seven issues, while women suffer discharge issues. The belt channel arises from the lower ribs&#39; Zhangmen point, resembling a supportive belt. Currently, damp-heat is bound and stagnant, causing illness. The classics state: the spleen transmits to the kidneys; this malady is termed &quot;accumulation and hernia,&quot; featuring painful, heat-laden conditions in the lower abdomen with white discharges, also referred to as &quot;poison,&quot; hence associated with discharges&#39; binding. Binding refers to constriction, causing stagnant heat that does not dissipate. First, treat with a decoction of ten jujubes, then take bitter neem pills and Dazhuansuan to help clear the heat and eliminate dampness, allowing the condition to heal spontaneously.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the selected &quot;Holy Essential Formulas&quot; from twenty-three volumes, it discusses women&#39;s leucorrhea, stating: Women&#39;s discharge is due to excessive mental strain, which damages the menstrual blood, leading to a weakened body susceptible to cold winds. The cold winds invade the channels, affecting the blood as it is formed. In the &quot;Inner Chapters&quot; of the Chao family, from forty-four volumes, it discusses that the Ren channel is regarded as the sea of the channels; when there is a disorder in it, for women, it manifests as leucorrhea. The Hand Taiyang corresponds to the Small Intestine channel, and the Hand Shaoyin corresponds to the Heart channel. The Heart is the internal organ ruling internally, while the Small Intestine is the organ ruling externally. The blood of these two channels in women produces milk above and menstrual fluid below, governed by the Chong and Ren channels.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The channels of Chong and Ren originate within the womb. When Yin and Yang are excessive, they harm the networks of the lungs, allowing wind pathogens to enter the lungs through the void. This damages the channels of Chong and Ren, injuring the blood of the Taiyang and Shaoyang, resulting in a mixture of impurities and blood in the lung networks, where cold manifests as more white and heat as more red. Both schools of thought on this matter are incorrect. In treating illness, one must first understand the meridians. In the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; the twelve meridians contain diseases that arise from movement and those that arise from formation. There are twelve main meridians and eight extraordinary vessels. Beyond the twelve meridians, there are these eight extraordinary pathways. Together, the twelve meridians and the eight extraordinary vessels comprise twenty pathways throughout the body, circulating and connecting, flowing continuously day and night in harmony with the heavens. The hand Taiyin lung meridian begins and travels twenty-five degrees in Yang and twenty-five degrees in Yin, ultimately converging back to the hand Taiyin lung meridian. However, among these twenty pathways, only nineteen continuously flow up and down.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

The Chong, Ren, and Du vessels originate together but travel differently, branching from a single source, all connecting to the belt vessel. The three vessels (Chong, Ren, Du) converge at the Sānhù, encompassing the yin organs, and passing through the orifices of the bladder and other excretory points.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heat refers to blood; when blood accumulates without flow for many days, it transforms into fire from metal. Metal, when transformed, becomes white, and it rides the stifled heat in the lower abdomen, resulting in a white fluid that continually flows down with urine, often without pain. If there is pain, it is caused by obstruction, and pain arises from this obstruction. The Inner Canon states that stifled heat in the lower abdomen leads to white liquid in the urine. Stifled heat refers to stagnation; the illness does not originate in the primary channel but is a result of stagnation in other channels causing this ailment. Stagnation can also be interpreted as a guest, suggesting a lingering heat in the lower abdomen. This heat transforms from metal and becomes white. In cases of dysentery with red and white elements, red indicates new accumulation from heart fire, while white indicates old accumulation from lung metal. Therefore, red and white dysentery should not be differentiated based on cold and heat, but rather by the newness or oldness for treatment. If an abscess starts with red blood and later breaks to release white pus, how can this be purely a cold condition? Yet, patients may still doubt this diagnosis.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Liu Hejian often said this about gold. It is said that when there is much cold, it turns white. To treat dysentery, one can use dried ginger, red vermilion, and peach blossom pills, but even if healed, one will surely develop blood disorders. For conditions like excessive leucorrhea, one should directly use white peony and dried ginger, yet even if the discharge improves, urination will likely remain unbeneficial. Treating diarrhea and leucorrhea should not abruptly employ harsh, hot medicines; doing so will dry up internal fluids, leading to intense thirst. When thirsty, urination becomes difficult, and this can cause swelling in the feet and puffiness in the face, gradually leading to an inability to heal. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires can lead to excessive indulgence, which causes muscle weakness and the release of white substances resembling sperm. Men may suffer from this through urination while women experience a continuous flow. The &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; mentions that when young men are infatuated with older women, like winds falling on mountains, it results in a disorder caused by obsession. This text discusses three insects in one plate known as &quot;gu,&quot; which embodies longing and desires that internally erode. If this erosion becomes severe, one should not immediately attack it with drying and heating medications, for such measures may lead to emaciation and weak pulses, ultimately resulting in death without remedy. Moreover, red and white dysentery indicates that pathogenic heat has transferred to the large intestine, producing red and white discharges. Leucorrhea involves transfer to the small intestine into the bladder meridian, also producing red and white. Therefore, both conditions can be treated together with methods aimed at dampness. First, eliminate the water with pills and the Yuguong powder; next, use gentle formulations to lower heart fire and nourish kidney water, facilitating urination and balancing water pathways, leading to self-healing. Recently, a woman in Qingtunqiu has suffered from continuous leucorrhea, with white substances appearing, for three years now.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p>She may experience continuous urination along with the flowing discharge, often unaware of it, her face pallid and eyes dark like withered vegetables. She has poor vision, feels heavy like a mountain, and finds it difficult to walk steadily.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Solid True Pill</strong></p>
<p>Women who have persistent leucorrhea experience cold pain in the lower abdomen; similarly, there is discomfort in the genital area. They see flickering fire in their eyes and have a blurry vision; their teeth feel hot and painful when drinking. The condition requires the use of finely ground yellow root applied externally to alleviate it. Such women prefer dry foods and have an aversion to soups and moist dishes. This illness is caused by cold and dampness invading the internal organs, hence the preference for dry food and aversion to moisture. The yin fire of the liver meridian surges up, causing congestion and flickering fire in the eyes. Kidney water invades the liver and also surges upwards, resulting in poor vision. The dislike for hot drinks is due to the hidden fire in the Yangming meridian. </p>
<p>The treatment method should primarily involve expelling cold and dampness, using pill medication for this purpose. Thus it is said: When cold is in the lower body, treatments should be mild, and soups or dispersing herbs should be avoided. Use wine to prepare white bismuth and dragon bone to dry out the dampness. Toast ginger, which is very hot and pungent, to disperse cold water, and employ the great cold nature of yellow root as the reason and the guide for the treatment. It is said: In ancient times, even with serious crimes, one should not completely sever reproductive capabilities. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is essential to address the root cause and precede the treatment aimed at alleviating the symptoms. The method also involves expelling the discomfort caused by hot drinks. Using Bupleurum as the messenger herb of the meridian, and Peony in a dosage of five parts to guide the treatment; since employing too much hot and pungent medication may harm the liver meridian, it should be done gently. With the spicy warmth of Angelica-Mongolica, it harmonizes the blood vessels, hence it is named Solid True Pill. The method of medication has been thoroughly outlined.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>What causes persistent white discharge in women with weak and subtle pulse? According to Shu He, prolonged menorrhagia leads to the continual flow of white discharge, which eventually dries up the bone marrow. Long-term loss of blood diminishes yang, resulting in continuous discharge of a slippery nature. This indicates that the blood sea is depleted, and bodily fluids have dwindled, leaving it unable to nourish the muscles and bones. Therefore, the herbs used to harmonize the channels are employed; pungent, sweet, oily herbs are utilized to moisten dryness and replenish fluids. Herbs with strong, warming properties support the yang and promote the blood vessels; bitter, cold herbs are used to drain the lungs and alleviate excessive heat affecting the qi. Ginseng is included for its nourishing properties, supplemented with slightly bitter and warming herbs to enhance the vital energy, thus forming what is called the Supplementary Decoction for the Regulation of the Menstrual Flow.

<p><strong>General Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For leucorrhea, red corresponds to blood, and white corresponds to qi. The primary treatment should address dampness as a priority. </p>
<p>Both leucorrhea and vaginal discharge are due to phlegm accumulation in the stomach flowing downward, seeping into the bladder, a fact not commonly understood. It is advisable to elevate; in severe cases, one must use leaves to lift the qi. For downward treatment, use Erchen Decoction with added Cangzhu and Baizhu, and still employ the small pills (some texts say &quot;瓦垄子&quot;). </p>
<p>Both red and white discharges are related to blood and arise from the distinction between the large and small intestines. Fat individuals often have excessive damp phlegm, treated with Hai Shi, Banxia, Nansheng, Chao Huanglian, Cangzhu, Chuanxiong, Chunze, and Qingdai among others. </p>
<p>Thin individuals have less white discharge, and when present, it is often due to heat. Treatment involves using Chao Huanglian, Huashi, Chunze, Chuanxiong, Hai Shi, Qingdai among others made into pills. If Hai Shi is not available, clam powder may also be used. </p>
<p>For red and white discharges, options include Shizaotang, Shenyouwan, or Yuzhusan. Strong cases may be treated actively, while weak cases should not be subjected to harsh measures. This is the law of Mr. Luo. </p>

<p>Red and white discharge is caused by emotional disturbances or weakness and coldness of the lower origin, with various underlying factors. Generally, there is more white discharge, with some cases of red discharge.

<p>Bleeding from the lower section may be relieved. There are cases where weakness due to blood deficiency leads to internal heat penetrating the small intestine, causing painful urination that is colorless and resembles water, or forms sand-like particles.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong>【Ming, Li Zhan】</p>
<p><strong>General Principles of Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: When the heart and abdomen are affected by stasis of heat and moisture, a white liquid is discharged in urination. This stasis refers to the accumulation of damp heat, which binds within the five organs, passing through the channel to the intestines, resulting in a discharge below, thus referred to as vaginal discharge. Red corresponds to blood, while white corresponds to qi. The symptoms include dizziness, blurred vision, bitterness in the mouth, dryness of the tongue, swelling and dryness in the throat, constipation or diarrhea in the bowels, and cloudy urination, all indicating a heat syndrome. It resembles the conditions of dysentery, but without pain. If pain does occur, it is due to damp heat causing obstruction, and may lead to abdominal pulling pains. Women often consume dried and hot foods, exhibiting erratic behavior, which leads to an overactive liver and a weakened spleen, resulting in damp heat, and the heat then flows throughout. The ancients used specific medicinal formulae, such as the Water-Promoting Pill, followed by gentle diuretics, or adjustments with Bitter Neem Pills or Great Yuanshuo Powder. For abdominal pain, one may temporarily use warming and dispersing methods, such as the Great Warming Channel Decoction, the Supplementing Channel and Firming True Decoction, or the Turtle Shell, Ginger, and Gardenia Pills. Thin individuals often experience heat, with rapid pulses and external signs of irritability, indicating a deficiency of yin and excess of fire, treated with the Huangqin and Cha Pi Pills.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a maiden first experiences menstruation, she may feel sudden anxiety; some bathe in cold water or cool themselves in the wind, which can lead to menstrual cessation and subsequently to leukorrhea. For this condition, it is advisable to use a formula of amber and red cinnabar pills. </p>
<p>For pregnant women with leukorrhea, which is caused entirely by damp heat, the mixture of Huangqin (Scutellaria), Zhuru (Ziziphus), and Chupi (Ailanthus) pills is recommended. </p>
<p>When yin and yang are imbalanced in usual circumstances, and due to blood loss postpartum leading to deficiency, wind evil may invade the womb. In this case, one should take warming uterine pills with ginger and Aconite, or a formula of Huangqi (Astragalus) and Jianzhong decoction minus cinnamon but added with Angelica, and stew it with bitter neem pills.</p>
<p>In general, for leukorrhea, one can either elevate and tonify with a formula like Shengyang Tiaojing decoction or consolidate with a treatment such as Fulonggan powder or Baizhi powder. However, if symptoms temporarily cease but then return, it is primarily due to the protective system&#39;s opening and closing, which governs the essence of blood. The spleen and stomach serve as the sea for blood and liquid; when both Wei qi and Stomach qi are deficient, blood fluid cannot be properly regulated. </p>
<p>Thus, ancient methods propose using Guizhi decoction with Aconite to strengthen defensive qi, or Sijunzi decoction combined with Caoguo (Amomum), cloves, and Mu Xiang to dry fluids and tonify the spleen. One may also use Liguang decoction with Chenpi (tangerine peel) and Banxia (Pinellia), or simply Banxia pills prepared with Chuanqiong decoction; or Baizhongyqi decoction and Pingwei powder, all of which replenish and strengthen the Wei and the spleen, allowing qi and blood to flow normally rather than overly focusing on consolidation which could lead to depletion.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a condition termed &quot;white profusion,&quot; resembling the appearance of white essence, which should not be mistaken for leukorrhea and should not be treated with excessive hot medicines.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> 【Ming - Wang Kentang】</p>
<p><strong>On Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>For women with abnormal vaginal discharge, it is a serious condition that can prevent childbirth, and prompt treatment is necessary. This is noted from the story of Bian Que passing through Handan, where he heard of a noblewoman specifically needing treatment for her discharge. There are three types of symptoms associated with vaginal discharge: For unmarried girls, if menstruation begins and is suddenly interrupted by bathing in cold water or being fanned in a warm room or exposed to the wind, this leads to the maiden&#39;s illness discharge. For married women, excessive yin and yang can damage the vessels, allowing wind pathogens to invade. If the vessels are exposed to cold, impure fluids mix with blood and flow down. Postpartum discharge occurs due to loss of blood and energy, which harms the vessels; when the door of the body is open to external wind, the body is weak, allowing cold wind to enter, causing a combination of wind and heat, leading to fluid discharge. Cold tends to produce more white discharge, while heat leads to more red; when cold and heat interact, both red and white are discharged.</p>
<p><strong>On Ancient Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>For discharge accompanied by pain and stasis in the lower abdomen, first administer the Ten Jujube Decoction, followed by bitter tree pills and Dayuan Hu powder. This follows the principle of attacking first and supplementing after, which should not be overlooked. For phlegm-related white discharge, use the Small Stomach Pill, taken when half-starved and half-full, taking a few pills to reduce accumulation, then take one tael of Atractylodes macrocephala, half a tael of Atractylodes, two and a half quarters of red and white sunflower, and seven and a half qian of white peony, all made into pills with steamed flour, and take twenty pills in the morning with Four Substances Decoction to supplement.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method for Drying Dampness</strong></p>
<p>If there is phlegm-dampness accompanied by weakness that does not tolerate attacks, dry it out. For heat and dampness, it&#39;s suitable to use cool dryness; for cold dampness, it&#39;s appropriate to use warm dryness.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Moistening Dried-Up Conditions</strong></p>
<p>For long-standing conditions that have dried up, moisten them. Generally, when heavily supplementing qi and blood, the goal is to moisten, such as using Si Wu Decoction as powder, forming honey pills the size of nuts, and taking three to four dozen with a light rice drink, to treat elderly women with white discharge. These are all moistening agents.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Nourishing Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>In cases where the pulse is weak and appetite is diminished, or in cases of prolonged illness that have been previously purged, all should be treated for deficiency. If there is heat, use cool tonics; if there is no heat, use warm tonics.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Sour Grass</strong></p>
<p>In &quot;Qian Jin,&quot; the treatment for red and white discharge uses three-leaved sour grass dried into powder, taken with wine. The leaves of this grass are as fine as duckweed, grow in clusters, and the stems end with three leaves, commonly known as cuckoo rice. The term &quot;cuckoo&quot; refers to the bird that frequently eats it, hence it is also called dove sour grass. &quot;Yan Yi&quot; mentions a bitter fruit that resembles a kumquat, which is sour and edible, thus it is named sour soup, but it does not have three leaves. The small sour grass spreads along the ground with three-lobed leaves, only producing yellow flowers, and both the stems and leaves are sour.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Causes of Pus Deficiency</strong></p>
<p>In cases of leucorrhea accompanied by pus in the intestines, continuous dripping occurs, with an especially foul odor. This leads to increased cold pain in the navel and abdomen, which is mainly caused by pus and blood. There are no set periods for treatment; the first step must be to expel the pus. Use one tael of angelica dahurica, two taels of the root of Malva neglecta, half a tael each of white peony root and alum (the alum should be burned to dryness and then ground separately). Mix the rest into a powder, make into pills the size of a tung nut with wax, and take ten or fifteen pills before meals with rice wine. Once the pus has been cleared, follow with complementary tonic herbs.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Formulas Examined</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wu Kun]</p>
<p><strong>On the Use of Angelica Dahurica, Fructus Viticis, and Wanglong Powder</strong></p>
<p>Leucorrhea arises from damp heat in the stomach, similar to urine being deposited in a receptacle, leading to a specific kind of discharge. Ancient famous physicians have used solely roasted angelica dahurica, solely roasted viticis fruit, or solely Wanglong powder in their treatments. The nature of angelica dahurica is fragrant and uplifting; that of viticis fruit is pungent and promotes qi; and Wanglong&#39;s nature is drying and overcomes dampness. Roasting them enhances their transformative powers—fire generates earth, which can ward off water; refining and grinding makes it dry enough to overcome dampness, and thus prevent downward flow and cease leucorrhea. This is the intention behind using these three ingredients.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Sunflower</strong></p>
<p>All people have a belt channel located between the waist and navel, which is one of the eight extraordinary vessels. It circles around like a waistband. If the lower burner is deficient and the governing and directing vessels are impaired, then the qi and blood of the middle burner invade from below, becoming trapped beneath the belt channel. When this happens, a qi condition is indicated by white discharge, while a blood condition is indicated by red discharge, referred to as &quot;red and white discharges.&quot;</p>
<p>Dongyuan states: white sunflower treats white discharge, while red sunflower treats red discharge. The red treats blood dryness, while the white treats qi dryness; what does this mean? Kun refers to sunflower as the calyx of morning sun, endowed with the yin of plants, encompassing the yang of heaven and earth. Thus, it can moisten dryness and elevate the yang, allowing the nutritive and protective qi to rise, preventing it from becoming trapped beneath the belt channel and resulting in discharge.</p>
<p>Someone may ask: if the disease of discharge is indeed this, what is the point of saying that excess damp-heat in the stomach can lead to discharge? I respond: for women who are otherwise healthy but have only white discharge, it is attributed to damp-heat descending. For women with prolonged illness, where both red and white discharges occur, this is due to the sinking of qi and blood, often leading to tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a notion that white discharge is associated with cold and red discharge with heat; how can this be understood? I respond: I have seen cases where those with cold can have red discharge, and those with heat can have increased white discharge. This notion of white as cold and red as heat is insufficiently convincing. If this were the case, then would the occurrence of both red and white discharges indicate the presence of both cold and heat? The teachings on this matter do not align with that interpretation.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Use of White Horse Hair and its Relation to Medicine</strong></p>
<p>When qi is trapped in the lower region, it results in a white discharge; when blood is trapped there, it results in a red discharge. If astringent herbs are used to stop this, the lingering discharge persists and does not resolve. If a laxative herb is used, it not only damages the interior but also harms the lower region, and neither approach is a proper treatment. </p>
<p>The white horse possesses the strength of its hair, and the hair derives from blood. The surplus blood can stabilize blood circulation, and the firmness of the hair can relieve qi. Stabilizing blood will stop the red discharge, while invigorating qi will resolve the white discharge. This is the purpose of utilizing horse hair. </p>
<p>The turtle, soft-shelled turtle, and oyster are hard on the outside but soft on the inside, symbolizing separation. By removing their softness and using their hardness, they can transform conditions and stabilize qi. Transformation of conditions means that the resulting discharges of red and white will no longer remain trapped. Stabilizing qi ensures that the nutritive and defensive energies do not descend into the lower region. When the nutritive energy does not descend, there will be no red discharge; when the defensive energy does not descend, there will be no white discharge.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Discharge</strong></p>
<p>The blood of women is referred to as &quot;the seven losses.&quot; The upper aspect produces milk, while the lower aspect corresponds to menstruation. The fluids related to intercourse and the discharges during conditions of leakage and profuse bleeding are all considered blood of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Female Secret Pathologies</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wanquan)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Disorders related to discharges are common among women. Red discharges suggest heat and are treated with a combination of tonifying and heat-clearing methods. White discharges indicate dampness and are treated with remedies for deficiency and phlegm. For cases persisting for many years, the focus should be on tonifying the spleen and stomach, along with methods to lift and strengthen. Generally, lean individuals tend to have more heat, while heavier individuals accumulate phlegm.</p>
<p><strong>Medicinal Formulations Required</strong></p>
<p>For red discharges, use the Four Substance Decoction with added Scutellaria and Lian Qiao, along with Sheng Ma and Dan Pi as the main ingredients, and also take San Bu Wan. For white discharges, the modified Six Gentleman Decoction serves as the chief remedy, supplemented with Cang Sha Pearls to guide phlegm. For persistent discharges, it is advisable to take Ten Complete Great Tonifying Decoction, removing Rehmannia and adding Chen Pi, Ban Xia, and roasted dry ginger, alongside Ren Shen Xu and Da Bu Wan to strengthen the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, as well as using Bu Gong Wan to stabilize the lower source.</p>
<p><strong>Difference between White Discharge and Leucorrhea</strong></p>
<p>The white discharge in women differs from leucorrhea and white turbidity diseases in both symptomatology and treatment protocols. The white discharge is characterized by a continuous flow, being clear, cold, thick, and sticky, indicating deficiency of the lower source. This should be treated with methods used for discharges that persist for long periods, unlike white turbidity, which is muddy and appears in conjunction with urination.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Although women&#39;s leucorrhea may seem minimal, it is essentially of the same nature. It arises because of the subtlety of the discharge and its severity. This is mainly due to the instability of the Mingmen (the life gate), and the causes for this instability can be categorized into six: </p>
<p>Firstly, the fluctuation caused by the heart&#39;s disturbance; when the heart is unsettled, it affects the Mingmen, causing it to lose its protective function—this is due to excessive ambition. Secondly, the slide of excessive desires; when emotions are unrestrained and indulgence knows no limits, the essence flows and the Mingmen fails to contain it—this is due to excessive satisfaction. Thirdly, the discord in the marital chamber; in the relations between men and women, there is a difference in timing; this imbalance often yields to male desires, leading to female emotions being stifled. When there is a halt, it results in stagnation, then muddiness and leucorrhea occur—this issue of satisfaction is what women experience the most yet rarely voice.</p>
<p>Among the three factors outlined, the causes of leucorrhea predominantly stem from these, with about eight or nine cases out of ten. To treat them, it is essential to clarify the source of each cause for effective results. However, the source may not be readily clear, and since it can be instantly triggered, the effects of medicine cannot easily contend with emotional stirrings—this is why leucorrhea is not easily treated. </p>
<p>Besides these three causes, there are also damp-heat flow downward, virtual coldness leading to instability, and deficiencies in the spleen and kidneys that fail to manage properly. Each issue should be addressed according to its specific symptoms.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>When the heart is restless, and there is a flow of discharges due to unsteady heart fire, it is necessary to first clear the fire. It is advisable to use calming medicine such as Zhu Sha An Shen Wan, Qing Xin Lian Zi Yin, or Zhi Zhi Gu Jing Wan, among others. </p>
<p>In the case of a lack of evil fire and merely seeing a weak heart with discharges, it is suitable to use medicine like Mi Yuan Jian, Ren Shen Wan, Xin Xu Bai Zhuo Yin, and Fu Ling Wan, etc.</p>
<p>If there is excessive desire leading to slippery discharge that is not firm, one should use Mi Yuan Jian, Shou Pi Jian, Gu Yin Jian, Ling Zhu Tu Si Wan, Ji Sheng Gu Jing Wan, Lock Jing Wan, or Jin Suo Si Xian Dan, among others.</p>
<p>For individuals experiencing stagnation in their activities, where the essence flows back and becomes turbid, it is best to begin with Liu Wei Di Huang Tang or Wei Xi Wan to aid it; if it continues for a long time, Gu Yin Jian or Ling Zhu Tu Si Wan should be used to strengthen it.</p>
<p>If there is damp-heat flowing down causing turbid discharges, the pulse must be slippery and rapid, with a red hue present, along with symptoms of thirst and heat; in such cases, Bao Yin Jian or a modified Xiao Yao San should be taken. In severe heat with redness and painful urination, Long Dan Xie Gan Tang is recommended.</p>
<p>If the original energy is weak, causing discharges, the following remedies are appropriate: Shou Pi Jian, Gu Yin Jian, Tu Si Jian, Qi Fu Yin, Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, or Jiu Long Wan, among others.</p>
<p>In cases of weak Yang energy and cold, where the pulse is fine and weak, the complexion is pale and cool, and the abdomen often feels cold, it is advised to add ginger and Fu Zi or use Homegrown Chives Pills.</p>
<p>For individuals with spleen and kidney Qi deficiency leading to excessive discharge, it is best to use Shou Pi Jian, Gu Yin Jian, Gui Pi Tang, or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, among others.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>In &quot;Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety,&quot; it is stated: The wife of Li Zuoya from Xicheng suffered from a discharge like water, continuous and unending, with an unbearable foul odor. She had a pale complexion and had reduced her food intake for three years. The physicians all diagnosed her condition as due to accumulated cold. They prescribed various herbs including stone, sulfur, ginger, and others, aiming to dry and replenish her, but the discharge only increased. She frequently changed her clothes due to the condition. </p>
<p>One remedy suggested involved taking ten pounds of charcoal, placing the herbs in a crucible, sealing it with salt mud, and maintaining continuous charcoal heat for three days and nights until it turned completely red, thus creating a medicine known as Water Dragon Pill, which she took in large quantities, but the discharges worsened. Cautiously, the physician Dairen concluded that this was a case of severe dampness caused by heat impacting the channels of the sun; that is, the cold water was overwhelming. Since water flows downward from high to low, it is essential to cut off the source above. </p>
<p>The patient released two to three liters of thick fluid, and the next day expelled more than ten streams of muddy water. After three rounds of vigorous sweating, by dawn, the patient reported that the foul discharge had ceased. Subsequently, she was given a cold and cooling remedy, and after half a year, she gave birth to a son. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that when there is heat in the lower abdomen, white fluid is discharged. The condition resembles sitting in water. Therefore, treating abnormal discharges is similar to treating dampness, requiring the expulsion of water and facilitating urination. Do not regard red as hot and white as cold. Liu Hejian&#39;s writings elaborate on this matter thoroughly.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Recently, there was a woman in Dongqiu who suffered from continuous vaginal discharge, a white fluid, for three years. I was asked to take her pulse. Upon diagnosing her wrists, the pulses felt smooth, large, and strong, with six or seven beats, and she often experienced heat in her body, dry mouth, dizziness, and occasional vomiting of sour fluid. I suspected she had cold phlegm in her chest, and used a remedy to expel cold phlegm, yielding two to three liters of fluid, mostly sour water, with some resembling yellow saliva and appearing like rotting glue. Next, I employed congee to nourish her stomach qi, then used methods to guide water and apply draining techniques to clear her lower body. After administering diuretic medicines that promote fluid drainage for several days, she was cured.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Danxi Heart Methods,&quot; it is stated: A Hu&#39;an woman suffers from excessive vaginal discharge, abundant menstrual flow, little appetite, fatigue, a pale face, and blood-like clots or membranous substances in her menstruation.

<p>According to &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Cases,&quot; one widowed woman presented with abdominal distension and pain in her sides, internal heat, afternoon fevers, irregular menstruation, and limbs that felt sore and numb, with sporadic phlegm. Initially, I used medicines to clear qi and transform phlegm, but her throat felt constricted, and she had a bluish-yellow discharge with abdominal distension. When I applied agents to move qi, her chest felt uncomfortably full, and her limbs remained numb. This condition was due to emotional distress harming her liver and spleen. I administered Guizhi Spleen Decoction in the morning to relieve spleen depression and strengthen spleen qi, followed by Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder in the evening to nourish liver blood and clear liver fire. After over a hundred doses, she was cured.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman experienced coughing and phlegm, with a feeling of fullness in the chest and wheezing. She found some relief after eating but suffered from excessive discharge for over twenty years, unresponsive to various medications. This was due to deficiency of qi and phlegm.

<p>Another woman had tinnitus and a feeling of fullness in the chest, with internal heat and dry mouth. She felt as though there was a lump in her throat, and swallowing was difficult.

<p>Lastly, a woman had yellow-white discharge, and when angry, she felt obstructed in the chest. She had reduced appetite and thought processes. I considered using herbs to disperse and regulate qi, yet she experienced phlegm, chest fullness, and bloody stools. I diagnosed this as due to deficiency of spleen qi, preventing it from absorbing and returning blood to the source. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi, adding Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and Pao Jiang in four doses, and also added Ba Zhen Tang with Chai Hu and Shan Zhi, leading to her healing.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman over sixty years old experienced internal heat and dry mouth. When fatigued, she had headaches, phlegm, and discharge. Attempts to resolve phlegm and promote Qi made her symptoms worse, leading to reduced appetite and occasional numbness in her limbs. After taking remedies to dispel wind and resolve phlegm, she continued to feel numbness in her limbs, with her hands and feet alternating between being cold and hot, and she gradually became emaciated. I said: This condition is due to weak spleen Qi, which cannot nourish the lungs. The wind-dispelling remedies further harm the meridians, so it is necessary to nourish the source of digestion. I then prescribed over twenty doses of a formula to tonify the middle and augment Qi, adding Poria, Pinellia, and roasted ginger. Her spleen Qi gradually improved, her appetite increased, and all symptoms quickly resolved.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: The wife of Xue Weng, aged over thirty, had eighteen pregnancies, with nine stillbirths and eight deaths in infancy. After being overly shocked and worried due to an event, she became confused and unaware of her surroundings, with sores on her mouth, lips, and tongue. At times, she nearly choked, suffering from lower body weakness and a profuse white discharge for over forty days. Occasionally, she became slightly aware, to the point of wanting to hang herself, feeling unable to bear the illness. When some cold remedies were given to address her upper symptoms, her lower condition worsened. Attempts to use hot remedies and steam treatments on her lower body only aggravated the heat. Four of her brothers checked her pulse and realized it was a case of Yang deficiency. In urgency, they prepared nine qian of processed Aconite boiled with salt as the main ingredient, with mint and Saposhnikovia as assistants, along with ginger, cinnamon, Chuanxiong, and angelica. They decocted it with cool spring water and gave it to her. After just a few doses, she fell into a deep sleep, breathing steadily through the night, and upon waking, she could recognize people. At that time, she had one son and two daughters, who held onto each other and wept, with everyone filled with sorrow.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

This way, the upper and lower parts harmonize and the illness resolves.&quot; </p>
<p>Following the former ruler, I used a female elixir of gold and combined it with various prescriptions, which not only cured the ailments but also balanced the vital energy. In the year of Gengwu, a son was born, and in Ren Shen, another son was born. Last year, I also suffered from intermittent fever for thirteen months; I relied on nourishing the vital energy and regulating the life force. After a substantial intake of food, I then countered it with toxic medicine, resulting in significant purging with much vomit and stool. Afterwards, I administered three qian of aconite soup and he recovered. </p>
<p>Effectiveness was not tied to the morning or evening. The elixir used was indeed superior to the golden pills obtained from extraordinary sources. By increasing the amount of cyperus and examining the imbalances of qi and blood, I also added turmeric and various herbs akin to gentian, which yielded significant results. </p>
<p>I pondered that those without children often face such hardships, and reflecting on how difficult it is for me to have children, I felt the bitterness of it.

In the middle abdomen, there may be a cold hernia around the navel, or pain in the flanks connected to the organs, or a binding of heat within causing pain in the lower abdomen, with a pulse that is rapid without sores. The skin may appear like fish scales, and these symptoms can also manifest in men, not only in women. In the lower abdomen, symptoms aren't pronounced, the menstrual cycle is irregular, leading to painful pulling in the genitals, coldness in the lower abdomen, or radiating pain in the lower back and spine. The qi is in upheaval, causing rapid, intense pain, knee and shin discomfort, sudden dizziness or faintness resembling syncope, and emotional distress characterized by worry and excessive anger. All these symptoms are aspects of leucorrhea and are not the result of supernatural beings. Over time, there may be emaciation, a weak pulse with much cold, reflecting the complexity of thirty-six diseases and myriad variations. Careful examination of the pulse on both yin and yang, and distinguishing between deficiency and excess, allows for precise treatment with acupuncture and herbal medicine, ensuring safety in critical situations. Although the same disease may present, the pulses may differ; therefore, one must distinguish and take note, lest one claims otherwise. A question was asked: A woman aged fifty has experienced profuse discharges for several days without cessation, with evening fevers, urgent sensations in the lower abdomen, fullness in the belly accompanied by heat in the palms, and dryness of the lips and mouth. Why is this? The teacher replied: This ailment is related to leucorrhea. Why is that? It has been chronic after a partial delivery, where stagnant blood remains in the lower abdomen. How can we know?

The master said: Discharge has three gates: the first is the womb gate, the second is the dragon gate, and the third is the jade gate. For those who have given birth, it pertains to the womb gate; for those who haven't given birth, it relates to the dragon gate; unmarried girls correspond to the jade gate.

A question was asked: If a woman suffers from a condition like epilepsy with many episodes in a day, and the teacher checks her pulse, finding it exhibits leukorrhea as mentioned, what type of pulse is this, and how can it be differentiated? The teacher replied: The cun pulse is soft yet tight. Softness indicates weak yang, while tightness indicates cold in the channels. With weak yang and a deficiency in protective qi, the blood is exhausted and congealed with cold. Yin and yang are imbalanced, and evil qi takes refuge in the protective network. The illness may arise from an early onset of menstruation due to engaging in intimate relations, leading to excessive strain. This causes the essence to affect the life gate, resulting in blood deficiency from menstrual loss, causing the channels to engorge. The central cavity feels the movement of yang, and a slight breeze causes cold to arise, leaving the protective network vacated, leading to cold accumulation in the lower abdomen. This triggers an upward thrust, rushing to the chest cavity, where fluids are obstructed, overflowing with saliva and drool, presenting symptoms like dizziness and syncope. The qi surges in the hips creating heat, which is commonly referred to as epilepsy by inexperienced doctors, but burning moxibustion can exacerbate the condition. When diagnosing a woman with bleeding that is red and white, if the blood flow is frequent, a rapid pulse indicates death; a slower pulse suggests survival. For a woman with persistent bleeding that is red and white, a pulse that is small and weak indicates survival, while a tight, rapid pulse suggests death.

There exists a channel called the \"Dai Mai\" that runs horizontally around the waist, resembling a belt, and diseases arise from this, hence the name \"Dai.\" **Note:** According to Mr. Xu Yongcheng, the white discharge is linked to qi and the red is connected to blood. Mr. Dongyuan states that prolonged blood loss can lead to yang deficiency. Therefore, a white, slippery substance that flows down does not necessarily confine to the Dai channel; it may also involve damp phlegm descending to the lower burner, excess yin from the kidney and liver, or downward flow caused by shock and fear leading to turbid fluids, or emotional distress causing muscle weakness. For those with six pulses that are slippery, strong, and large, one should use methods to promote and guide this discharge; this can be considered as purging.

Among those, seven symptoms, eight masses, and twelve types of vaginal discharge are mentioned. However, the so-called twelve types of vaginal discharge do not explicitly describe their symptoms. The prevalent conditions today are merely red and white discharges. Analyzing their origins, it results from excessive strain, dysfunction of the Chong and Ren channels, and the invasion of wind and cold in the uterus, which is the cause of these illnesses. Additionally, during ordinary times, a woman's blood should be abundant, while her qi should be relatively less, which implies that proper qi supports health and prevents diseases. If, by chance, the qi exceeds the blood, it produces cold, and the blood fails to transform into a red state, thus resulting in a white discharge. Conversely, if the qi is balanced but the blood is insufficient, the blood generates heat, and when it fails to transform into a red state, it causes a red discharge. When cold and heat combine, both red and white discharges may occur. For unmarried women or those who have given birth and suffer from these ailments, it can lead to issues with conceiving, leading to infertility. Anyone exhibiting these symptoms should seek treatment promptly. If left untreated for long, it can result in a dark complexion, emaciation of the muscles, abdominal and flank distension, painful stabbing sensations; and even the limbs may become thin and cold, causing extreme discomfort and inability to eat.

Fundamentally, they are both due to damp-heat stagnating in the channels, leading to an overabundance of fluids, which manifests as red and white discharges. There is initially no pain from the stagnation, but due to the deficiency in the five channels, the accumulated heat becomes constricted in the belt channel. Thus, women experience continuous pain below the navel, and sometimes discharges from the genitalia. Hence the classic states: the Ren channel is affected; men may have seven types of internal accumulations, while women deal with discharges and accumulations from the belt channel. Wang's commentary states: the Ren channel runs from above the womb over the belt channel, connecting above the navel. Therefore, men face internal accumulations of seven issues, while women suffer discharge issues. The belt channel arises from the lower ribs' Zhangmen point, resembling a supportive belt. Currently, damp-heat is bound and stagnant, causing illness. The classics state: the spleen transmits to the kidneys; this malady is termed \"accumulation and hernia,\" featuring painful, heat-laden conditions in the lower abdomen with white discharges, also referred to as \"poison,\" hence associated with discharges' binding. Binding refers to constriction, causing stagnant heat that does not dissipate.

The cold winds invade the channels, affecting the blood as it is formed. In the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Chao family, from forty-four volumes, it discusses that the Ren channel is regarded as the sea of the channels; when there is a disorder in it, for women, it manifests as leucorrhea. The Hand Taiyang corresponds to the Small Intestine channel, and the Hand Shaoyin corresponds to the Heart channel. The Heart is the internal organ ruling internally, while the Small Intestine is the organ ruling externally.

Both schools of thought on this matter are incorrect. In treating illness, one must first understand the meridians. In the \"Ling Shu,\" the twelve meridians contain diseases that arise from movement and those that arise from formation. There are twelve main meridians and eight extraordinary vessels. Beyond the twelve meridians, there are these eight extraordinary pathways. Together, the twelve meridians and the eight extraordinary vessels comprise twenty pathways throughout the body, circulating and connecting, flowing continuously day and night in harmony with the heavens.

The Chong and Ren vessels are like the ocean of meridians, traveling along the abdomen and lateral ribs, flanking the navel, connecting and flowing into the Qi Chong vessel, linked to the belt vessel, which is connected to the Du vessel. The Du vessel arises at the Guan Yuan point, while the Ren vessel governs the nurturing and pregnancy of women. The Du vessel oversees and leads the ocean of female meridians. The Chong, Ren, and Du vessels originate together but travel differently, branching from a single source, all connecting to the belt vessel. The three vessels (Chong, Ren, Du) converge at the Sānhù, encompassing the yin organs, and passing through the orifices of the bladder and other excretory points.

Metal, when transformed, becomes white, and it rides the stifled heat in the lower abdomen, resulting in a white fluid that continually flows down with urine, often without pain. If there is pain, it is caused by obstruction, and pain arises from this obstruction. The Inner Canon states that stifled heat in the lower abdomen leads to white liquid in the urine. Stifled heat refers to stagnation; the illness does not originate in the primary channel but is a result of stagnation in other channels causing this ailment. Stagnation can also be interpreted as a guest, suggesting a lingering heat in the lower abdomen. This heat transforms from metal and becomes white. In cases of dysentery with red and white elements, red indicates new accumulation from heart fire, while white indicates old accumulation from lung metal. Therefore, red and white dysentery should not be differentiated based on cold and heat, but rather by the newness or oldness for treatment. If an abscess starts with red blood and later breaks to release white pus, how can this be purely a cold condition?

For conditions like excessive leucorrhea, one should directly use white peony and dried ginger, yet even if the discharge improves, urination will likely remain unbeneficial. Treating diarrhea and leucorrhea should not abruptly employ harsh, hot medicines; doing so will dry up internal fluids, leading to intense thirst. When thirsty, urination becomes difficult, and this can cause swelling in the feet and puffiness in the face, gradually leading to an inability to heal. The \"Inner Canon\" states: endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires can lead to excessive indulgence, which causes muscle weakness and the release of white substances resembling sperm. Men may suffer from this through urination while women experience a continuous flow. The \"Zuo Zhuan\" mentions that when young men are infatuated with older women, like winds falling on mountains, it results in a disorder caused by obsession. This text discusses three insects in one plate known as \"gu,\" which embodies longing and desires that internally erode. If this erosion becomes severe, one should not immediately attack it with drying and heating medications, for such measures may lead to emaciation and weak pulses, ultimately resulting in death without remedy. Moreover, red and white dysentery indicates that pathogenic heat has transferred to the large intestine, producing red and white discharges. Leucorrhea involves transfer to the small intestine into the bladder meridian, also producing red and white. Therefore, both conditions can be treated together with methods aimed at dampness. First, eliminate the water with pills and the Yuguong powder; next, use gentle formulations to lower heart fire and nourish kidney water, facilitating urination and balancing water pathways, leading to self-healing.

Thus it is said: When cold is in the lower body, treatments should be mild, and soups or dispersing herbs should be avoided. Use wine to prepare white bismuth and dragon bone to dry out the dampness. Toast ginger, which is very hot and pungent, to disperse cold water, and employ the great cold nature of yellow root as the reason and the guide for the treatment.

This indicates that the blood sea is depleted, and bodily fluids have dwindled, leaving it unable to nourish the muscles and bones. Therefore, the herbs used to harmonize the channels are employed; pungent, sweet, oily herbs are utilized to moisten dryness and replenish fluids. Herbs with strong, warming properties support the yang and promote the blood vessels; bitter, cold herbs are used to drain the lungs and alleviate excessive heat affecting the qi.

There are three types of symptoms associated with vaginal discharge: For unmarried girls, if menstruation begins and is suddenly interrupted by bathing in cold water or being fanned in a warm room or exposed to the wind, this leads to the maiden's illness discharge. For married women, excessive yin and yang can damage the vessels, allowing wind pathogens to invade. If the vessels are exposed to cold, impure fluids mix with blood and flow down. Postpartum discharge occurs due to loss of blood and energy, which harms the vessels; when the door of the body is open to external wind, the body is weak, allowing cold wind to enter, causing a combination of wind and heat, leading to fluid discharge. Cold tends to produce more white discharge, while heat leads to more red; when cold and heat interact, both red and white are discharged. **On Ancient Treatment Methods** For discharge accompanied by pain and stasis in the lower abdomen, first administer the Ten Jujube Decoction, followed by bitter tree pills and Dayuan Hu powder.

It arises because of the subtlety of the discharge and its severity.

Secondly, the slide of excessive desires; when emotions are unrestrained and indulgence knows no limits, the essence flows and the Mingmen fails to contain it—this is due to excessive satisfaction. Thirdly, the discord in the marital chamber; in the relations between men and women, there is a difference in timing; this imbalance often yields to male desires, leading to female emotions being stifled. When there is a halt, it results in stagnation, then muddiness and leucorrhea occur—this issue of satisfaction is what women experience the most yet rarely voice. Among the three factors outlined, the causes of leucorrhea predominantly stem from these, with about eight or nine cases out of ten. To treat them, it is essential to clarify the source of each cause for effective results. However, the source may not be readily clear, and since it can be instantly triggered, the effects of medicine cannot easily contend with emotional stirrings—this is why leucorrhea is not easily treated.

She had a pale complexion and had reduced her food intake for three years. The physicians all diagnosed her condition as due to accumulated cold. They prescribed various herbs including stone, sulfur, ginger, and others, aiming to dry and replenish her, but the discharge only increased. She frequently changed her clothes due to the condition. One remedy suggested involved taking ten pounds of charcoal, placing the herbs in a crucible, sealing it with salt mud, and maintaining continuous charcoal heat for three days and nights until it turned completely red, thus creating a medicine known as Water Dragon Pill, which she took in large quantities, but the discharges worsened. Cautiously, the physician Dairen concluded that this was a case of severe dampness caused by heat impacting the channels of the sun; that is, the cold water was overwhelming. Since water flows downward from high to low, it is essential to cut off the source above. The patient released two to three liters of thick fluid, and the next day expelled more than ten streams of muddy water. After three rounds of vigorous sweating, by dawn, the patient reported that the foul discharge had ceased. Subsequently, she was given a cold and cooling remedy, and after half a year, she gave birth to a son. The \"Inner Canon\" states that when there is heat in the lower abdomen, white fluid is discharged. The condition resembles sitting in water. Therefore, treating abnormal discharges is similar to treating dampness, requiring the expulsion of water and facilitating urination. Do not regard red as hot and white as cold.

I suspected she had cold phlegm in her chest, and used a remedy to expel cold phlegm, yielding two to three liters of fluid, mostly sour water, with some resembling yellow saliva and appearing like rotting glue. Next, I employed congee to nourish her stomach qi, then used methods to guide water and apply draining techniques to clear her lower body. After administering diuretic medicines that promote fluid drainage for several days, she was cured. In the \"Danxi Heart Methods,\" it is stated: A Hu'an woman suffers from excessive vaginal discharge, abundant menstrual flow, little appetite, fatigue, a pale face, and blood-like clots or membranous substances in her menstruation. I recommended using ginseng, atractylodes, and other tonics to replenish blood and qi, balancing the spleen and stomach; eventually, all symptoms diminished, but the discharge persisted, for which I prescribed Chupi Pills, leading to her recovery. According to \"Xue's Medical Cases,\" one widowed woman presented with abdominal distension and pain in her sides, internal heat, afternoon fevers, irregular menstruation, and limbs that felt sore and numb, with sporadic phlegm. Initially, I used medicines to clear qi and transform phlegm, but her throat felt constricted, and she had a bluish-yellow discharge with abdominal distension. When I applied agents to move qi, her chest felt uncomfortably full, and her limbs remained numb. This condition was due to emotional distress harming her liver and spleen. I administered Guizhi Spleen Decoction in the morning to relieve spleen depression and strengthen spleen qi, followed by Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder in the evening to nourish liver blood and clear liver fire. After over a hundred doses, she was cured."},{"anchor":"trans-99p","marker":"99p","type":"translation","text":"A woman experienced coughing and phlegm, with a feeling of fullness in the chest and wheezing. She found some relief after eating but suffered from excessive discharge for over twenty years, unresponsive to various medications. This was due to deficiency of qi and phlegm. As the phlegm decreased, the discharge resolved itself. Therefore, she took Liu Jun Zi Tang in the morning and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan in the evening, and within a month, she saw improvement. Another woman had tinnitus and a feeling of fullness in the chest, with internal heat and dry mouth. She felt as though there was a lump in her throat, and swallowing was difficult. Her menstrual cycles were irregular, and she also had discharge. I diagnosed her with liver and spleen stagnation and prescribed Gui Pi Tang, adding Ban Xia, Shan Zhi, Sheng Ma, and Chai Hu. Alternating with Si Qi Tang and taking white pills, she recovered. A different woman experienced sourness in her throat, fullness after eating, a reduced appetite, and diarrhea. Her menstrual cycle was irregular. She took Qing Qi Hua Tan Wan, but then her knees swelled gradually, with alternating chills and fever, yellow-white discharge, facial weakness, and body fatigue. This indicated deficiency in both spleen and stomach, with damp phlegm downward. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, increasing the amount of Ren Shen and Bai Zhu, and added Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and Pao Jiang, leading to her recovery. Another woman had discharge and weakness in her limbs. I stated: \"The limbs correspond to the earth element.\" This indicated weakness in the spleen and stomach, with damp phlegm downward. I treated her with Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Ji Sheng Gui Pi, resulting in her recovery. Lastly, a woman had yellow-white discharge, and when angry, she felt obstructed in the chest. She had reduced appetite and thought processes. I considered using herbs to disperse and regulate qi, yet she experienced phlegm, chest fullness, and bloody stools. I diagnosed this as due to deficiency of spleen qi, preventing it from absorbing and returning blood to the source. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi, adding Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and Pao Jiang in four doses, and also added Ba Zhen Tang with Chai Hu and Shan Zhi, leading to her healing."},{"anchor":"trans-100p","marker":"100p","type":"translation","text":"A woman over sixty years old experienced internal heat and dry mouth. When fatigued, she had headaches, phlegm, and discharge. Attempts to resolve phlegm and promote Qi made her symptoms worse, leading to reduced appetite and occasional numbness in her limbs. After taking remedies to dispel wind and resolve phlegm, she continued to feel numbness in her limbs, with her hands and feet alternating between being cold and hot, and she gradually became emaciated. I said: This condition is due to weak spleen Qi, which cannot nourish the lungs. The wind-dispelling remedies further harm the meridians, so it is necessary to nourish the source of digestion. I then prescribed over twenty doses of a formula to tonify the middle and augment Qi, adding Poria, Pinellia, and roasted ginger. Her spleen Qi gradually improved, her appetite increased, and all symptoms quickly resolved. The \"Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment\" states: The wife of Xue Weng, aged over thirty, had eighteen pregnancies, with nine stillbirths and eight deaths in infancy. After being overly shocked and worried due to an event, she became confused and unaware of her surroundings, with sores on her mouth, lips, and tongue. At times, she nearly choked, suffering from lower body weakness and a profuse white discharge for over forty days. Occasionally, she became slightly aware, to the point of wanting to hang herself, feeling unable to bear the illness. When some cold remedies were given to address her upper symptoms, her lower condition worsened. Attempts to use hot remedies and steam treatments on her lower body only aggravated the heat. Four of her brothers checked her pulse and realized it was a case of Yang deficiency. In urgency, they prepared nine qian of processed Aconite boiled with salt as the main ingredient, with mint and Saposhnikovia as assistants, along with ginger, cinnamon, Chuanxiong, and angelica. They decocted it with cool spring water and gave it to her. After just a few doses, she fell into a deep sleep, breathing steadily through the night, and upon waking, she could recognize people. At that time, she had one son and two daughters, who held onto each other and wept, with everyone filled with sorrow."},{"anchor":"trans-101p","marker":"101p","type":"translation","text":"Zhao Xianchang, a close friend, exclaimed: \"What technique is this?\" The disciple replied: \"It is mentioned in the medical texts; we use false against false and true against true.

This way, the upper and lower parts harmonize and the illness resolves.\" Following the former ruler, I used a female elixir of gold and combined it with various prescriptions, which not only cured the ailments but also balanced the vital energy. In the year of Gengwu, a son was born, and in Ren Shen, another son was born. Last year, I also suffered from intermittent fever for thirteen months; I relied on nourishing the vital energy and regulating the life force. After a substantial intake of food, I then countered it with toxic medicine, resulting in significant purging with much vomit and stool. Afterwards, I administered three qian of aconite soup and he recovered. Effectiveness was not tied to the morning or evening. The elixir used was indeed superior to the golden pills obtained from extraordinary sources. By increasing the amount of cyperus and examining the imbalances of qi and blood, I also added turmeric and various herbs akin to gentian, which yielded significant results. I pondered that those without children often face such hardships, and reflecting on how difficult it is for me to have children, I felt the bitterness of it.
