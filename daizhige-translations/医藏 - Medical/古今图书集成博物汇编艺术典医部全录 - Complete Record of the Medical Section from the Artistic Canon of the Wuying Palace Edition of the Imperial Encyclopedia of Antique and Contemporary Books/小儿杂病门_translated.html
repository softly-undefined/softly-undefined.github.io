      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p>**Collected Works of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 452:    </p>
<p>Children’s Miscellaneous Diseases**     </p>
<p>From the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; by Sun Simiao (Tang Dynasty)       </p>
<p><strong>Evil Spirits</strong>     </p>
<p>It is stated that the reason children suffer from evil spirits (鬾) is because a woman during pregnancy is influenced by malevolent spirits that affect the fetus in her womb, causing jealousy towards other children and leading to illness. The term &quot;鬾&quot; refers to minor ghosts. A pregnant woman does not need to attract these spirits directly; sometimes, they manifest on their own. The symptoms of this illness include mild diarrhea, alternating cold and heat, and discomfort in the hair and beard, which are indicative signs. It is recommended to take Longdan Decoction. If a woman has a child that is still unable to walk and then becomes pregnant again, causing the infant to drink her milk, this can also lead to evil spirits (鬾). This results in the child appearing yellow and emaciated, with hair loss and high fever, which are further signs of the illness.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>Pediatric Direct Prescriptions (Song Dynasty - Qian Yi)</h3>
<h4>Aphasia</h4>
<p>If the child suffers from vomiting and diarrhea, or after defecation may have sound but is unable to speak, yet can swallow, it is not a loss of voice but a deficiency in the kidneys that fails to connect with the yang. One should treat it with the Rehmannia Pill. If the mouth remains tightly shut, phrases will be lost and speech will be slow. Note: This condition often arises from inherited kidney deficiency. The kidney meridian is connected to the root of the tongue; only the Rehmannia Pill can treat it. Therefore, in cases of this symptom, if they tilt their head back and cough, yet are unresponsive, one should also use the Middle-Boosting and Qi-Enhancing Decoction to nourish the source of transformation. If there is upward flaming of yin fire, harming the lung metal and causing loss of voice, it should also be treated by the previous method. The &quot;Infant Care Collection&quot; states: For children aged five to six with insufficient kidney energy resulting in speech inability, use the Sweet Flag Pill; for those with tightly sealed mouths unable to speak, use the Rehmannia Pill.</p>
<h3>Confucian Respect for Parents (Yuan Dynasty - Zhang Congzheng)</h3>
<h4>Paralysis</h4>
<p>For children, the combination of wind, dampness, and cold leads to paralysis, causing numbness in hands and feet. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: when the nutrients are deficient and the protective energy is strong, the skin can become numb, resulting in paralysis without awareness of itch or pain. One can use the Turmeric Powder to expel it, then take the Water-Promoting Pill, using mild cold medicines to purge it; after purging, apply warm pungent prescriptions to disperse. Once sweating occurs, regular consumption of Angelica, Peony, Aconite, and Myrrh with menstruating blood-nourishing medicines will ensure recovery.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Record of the Language of Chrysanthemum Slope</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>Today, when the infant was breastfeeding, the mother was pregnant. The child has a darkened brow, suffers from diarrhea, and is yellow and thin. This illness is commonly referred to as &#39;record.&#39; The &quot;Erya Yi&quot; states that the magpie can heal the subsequent disease. The subsequent disease refers to an illness where the mother is pregnant while nursing a child, causing the child to become ill as if suffering from a depletion.</p>
<p><strong>Hundred Questions of Infants</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Lu Bosi)</p>
<p><strong>Liver Disease</strong></p>
<p>Cao Shi says: When children suffer from liver disease, if a woman has a child who is not yet able to walk, and becomes pregnant again, this results in the child gradually becoming thin and bony, with sparse, yellow hair that does not grow long. The child often has fevers and irregular bowel movements; this is called liver disease. It is also stated: For treating subsequent disease, one should use the Zishuang Pills to reduce the liver milk, benefiting the Yellow Powder to supplement it, ensuring the child can wean successfully. The Xiaoru Pills and the Yigong Powder are also excellent remedies. If other women are pregnant and nurse other people&#39;s infants, they could also manifest this condition, treated in the same way. For those with heat symptoms, Longdan Decoction is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Compendium of Materia Medica</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Li Shizhen)</p>
<p><strong>Subsequent Disease</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Huainanzi,&quot; it is said: A man may cultivate beautiful orchids but they do not bloom, just as a stepchild may receive rich food but does not thrive; there is no mutual affection. This is because the feelings are tied to the child in the womb. The subsequent disease is also referred to as liver disease, where &#39;liver&#39; is the name for a minor ghost, indicating that the child is thin and weak like a ghost. Generally, it is a type of consumption illness.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>The Mind of a Physician, Miscellaneous Writings by Wang Lun</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Infants’ Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Infants often sleep well, which indicates a deficiency of the spleen leading to fatigue; there is no need to use the Warm Gallbladder Decoction. If they wake in fright and are restless, this suggests a deficiency of heart blood causing heat disturbance. A weak heart leads to fright; thus, it is advisable to clear the heart and calm the mind, nourishing the blood and reducing phlegm. If there is phlegm obstructing the chest, it can also cause fright; additionally, if the spleen and stomach are harmed, leading to stagnation, they too may experience restlessness. This again indicates issues related to the spleen, stomach, and phlegm, not simply heart blood. It is necessary to digest food and transform phlegm; clearing phlegm allows for the nourishment of the spleen and stomach. </p>
<p><strong>Notes: If the symptoms are due to deficiency of heart and spleen qi with phlegm, it is appropriate to use ginseng, atractylodes, poria, and five-flavor herb to replenish heart qi, with angelica, peony, and jujube seed to nourish heart blood, and tangerine peel and pinellia to resolve phlegm stagnation. If there’s deficiency of spleen and lung qi with phlegm in the chest, use the Renown-Enhancing Decoction to tonify middle qi, and use gallbladder star and forsythia to transform phlegm. If symptoms arise from food stagnation, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction to strengthen the spleen and stomach, with hawthorn and spirit food to digest food and drink. If the child sleeps well due to spleen deficiency, the Five-Flavor Adaptable Powder can be used to tonify spleen qi, along with angelica and peony to generate spleen blood. If the child is intoxicated from the mother’s drinking, use licorice and dried kudzu decoction to alleviate this; do not use the Four Gentlemen Decoction.</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Principles for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Wang Kentang of the Ming Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Regarding Blood Loss Syndromes</strong>  </p>
<p>What causes children to bleed through the nine orifices? It is due to the essential substances in humans: blood and qi. The heart governs blood, while the lungs govern qi. Qi promotes respiration, and blood nourishes the body, irrigating the meridians, elevating and lowering, harmonizing the body’s defenses. When any of these functions are disturbed, illness arises. This disturbance may come from external influences or the internal strain of emotions, leading to stagnant qi and blood that cannot circulate properly to nourish the body, thus risking errant movements. </p>
<p>Shuhe noted that the loss of blood pertains to the &quot;kuao pulse,&quot; associating it with the yang of the seven surfaces. The yangming channel dominates in terms of abundant qi and blood and has not been free from heat, as both qi and blood become heated, leading to internal stagnation and manifesting as erratic actions. </p>
<p>In infants with this condition, it is certainly not due to emotional disturbances; it is mainly because the wet nurse is overly strict, failing to provide necessary comfort, or because of spiciness in her diet that affects the milk. When the child drinks this, the stagnation persists internally, causing internal heat that can stir the blood. Additionally, if the child is kept in a heavy, warm room without fresh air, the oppressive heat accumulates and can become intense, leading to eruptions like vomiting or nasal bleeding, with various internal organs exhibiting excessive blood flow.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>When there is a deficiency of qi and external heat invades it, the blood cannot flow along its proper path and seeps into various channels, leading to symptoms of loss of control. The complexion becomes pallid, the pulse is deep and faint, the blood is pale purple, and the breath is weak. </p>
<p>Moreover, infants are fragile, easily suffering from both deficiency and excess. Due to internal heat attacking, blood follows the qi and may be obstructed, either rising in rebellion or descending without return, resulting in symptoms such as vomiting blood, nasal bleeding, diarrhea with blood, and blood in urine. However, blood does not flow rashly; it acts under the influence of qi, and wind does not arise on its own but is caused by heat. Based on this analysis, one can draw general conclusions. </p>
<p>The treatment method must first clarify deficiency and excess, carefully identify the source of the illness, and then apply appropriate treatment according to the channels, ensuring that medicinal prescriptions are precise, thus not missing the crucial points. </p>
<p>For excess, one can use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Sheng Di Huang and Si Mao Gen, or Ku Shen, prepared with water. Alternatively, one can grind Wu Ling San with Wu He Tang, also adding Si Mao Gen and Ku Shen, and boil it in water; and then use Xiao Du Drink. Next, use formulated medicinal pills like Ji Su Wan and San Huang Wan intermittently. </p>
<p>For deficiency, Li Zhong Tang and Ren Shen Qi Zang Tang are both suitable. Occasionally, some practitioners, seeing the abundance of blood, mistakenly believe it to be excessive heat and consequently overgive cooling agents, causing the blood to cool and fail to return to its source and thus flow erratically, appearing dark purple and stagnant. This can lead to small aggregations. It is vital to administer warming agents like ginger and Fu Zi to restore smooth flow, avoiding unintended consequences.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Coughing Up Blood</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Discussion on Infants&quot; states: Coughing up blood occurs when the circulation of blood and qi is disturbed. &quot;Rong&quot; refers to blood, while &quot;Wei&quot; refers to qi. When blood and qi are in harmony, they maintain their normal pathway; if one gains the upper hand, it leads to errant behavior. Blood is akin to water; if directed east, it flows east, if directed west, it flows west. Qi directs blood, exerting its influence this way. The Nest teachers say: Blood is associated with heat; when qi is strong but blood is weak, the heat takes control of the blood, causing erratic flow. When qi is reversed, blood rises with it, leading to coughing up blood. Additionally, overindulgence in food can create internal cold in the spleen and stomach, hindering digestion, thus causing regurgitation of food, where the conflict between qi and blood can injure the lungs and stomach, also resulting in coughing up blood. Chronic coughing can cause qi to rise and lead to symptoms such as swollen eyes and coughing up blood, indicating deficiency. </p>
<p>Clear elements represent &quot;Rong,&quot; while turbid elements represent &quot;Wei.&quot; &quot;Rong&quot; flows within the channels, while &quot;Wei&quot; flows outside of them. Essentially, &quot;Rong&quot; is the essence derived from food and drink, harmoniously regulating the five organs and dispersing into the six bowels, thereby entering the channels. &quot;Rong&quot; is the yin blood, governed primarily by the heart, transformed within the spleen, stored in the liver, distributed through the lungs, and excreted through the kidneys, nourishing the entire body and sustaining the numerous channels. Hence, the control over blood is held by qi, which is why it is said that qi governs exhalation, while blood governs moisture.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Thus, when the qi moves, the blood moves; when the qi stops, the blood stops. Yang generates while Yin grows; the husband and wife follow this principle. If the qi is harmed, it leads to a hundred changes in symptoms. Therefore, reckless actions can lead to vomiting and nosebleeds, decline leads to fatigue, descent leads to red stools, heat leads to red urine, infiltration in the intestines results in intestinal wind, and when Yin is deficient and Yang collides, it causes excessive bleeding. All of these indicate a disturbance in qi, while blood presents the problem of overflow. </p>
<p>However, can one nurture Yin without first understanding the way to nurture Yang? When children suffer, it is often due to inherent heat, or due to consuming rich foods, or from the emotional distress of the wet nurse. </p>
<p>For treatment, if there is qi deficiency and weak blood, one should supplement it with ginseng; if Yang is abundant, then Yin generates blood. The Si Wu Decoction can specifically address blood-related injuries and is effective if qi is not deficient. If the left cun pulse is rapid but weak, it indicates blood deficiency; one can add ginseng and atractylodes to Si Wu Decoction. If the pulse is floating and weak, it indicates qi deficiency; use the Ren Shen Bai Du San. If the pulse at the wrist is rapid or weak, it indicates kidney deficiency; use the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If the right cun pulse is rapid but strong, it suggests heat in the lungs and stomach; use the Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang, and then follow with Si Wu Decoction adding ginseng, poria, and atractylodes. If the pulse at the wrist is rapid and weak, it indicates Yin deficiency; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If one appears pale with yellow eyes and excessive drooling or numbness in the hands, it indicates spleen and lung deficiency; use Huang Qi Shao Yao Tang.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Nasal Bleeding</strong></p>
<p>Nasal bleeding is caused by a heat accumulation in the five organs. Blood travels with the qi, flowing through the organs and channels. When the balance of hot and cold is maintained, there is no blockage and no overflow. When blood is exposed to cold, it coagulates; when exposed to heat, it disperses. Heat acts upon the blood, causing it to surge with the qi and overflow from the nasal passages. </p>
<p>Additionally, due to the effects of cold and pestilence, when yang energies are affected and sweat cannot be released, the heat has no outlet, hence it flows from the nose.</p>
<p>For nasal bleeding in spring and winter, use fresh rehmannia root, extract its juice, and mix it with a little fresh cattail pollen, adding sugar dissolved in well water to take. This will cure it.</p>
<p>For nasal bleeding in autumn and summer, take a handful of plantain leaves, wash them clean, and grind them together with fresh ginger to extract the juice. Add a spoonful of raw honey, mix the residue to plug the nose, and then drink the mixture of fresh spring water and honey with the plantain and ginger juice. This will also cure it.</p>
<p>Another remedy: take fresh radish, crush it to obtain natural juice, and drops it into the nasal passages while tilting the head back; this will stop the bleeding. Then drink a mixture of fresh spring water, honey, and radish juice, which is effective.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>When one experiences a nosebleed due to shock and the dispersal of vital energy, use the formula Yi Gong San with added Chai Hu and Shan Zhi. If the left cheek is both blue and red, first apply Chai Hu Qing Fei San, then use Di Huang Wan. If the right cheek is red, this indicates excess heat in the lungs and large intestine; use Xie Bai San. If the nose is red, it indicates excess heat in the spleen and stomach; apply Xie Huang San. A slight redness points to deficient heat in the spleen meridian; use Yi Gong San with added Sheng Ma and Chai Hu. A deep yellow color requires Ji Sheng Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang, followed by Yang&#39;s Di Huang San. For a pale white color, use Liu Jun Zi Tang. If there is redness in the cheeks, apply Si Wu Tang with added Shan Zhi. In severe cases of redness, use Wu Lin San. If the urine is red, use Liu Wei Wan or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If the lips are white, use Liu Jun Zi Tang; if it does not improve after a long time, use Mai Men Dong Yin Zi. If the illness is recent with no loss of vital energy, normal appetite, fever, strong heat, constipation, thirst for water, and sleeping with eyes exposed, this indicates a solid form of illness that requires treatment for evils. If the illness has persisted for a long time and vital energy is depleted, with a decreased appetite, fever, dry mouth, drinking soup, vomiting, diarrhea, cold intolerance in limbs, and sleeping with eyes exposed, this indicates a deficient form of illness, and it is critical to tonify the correct energy.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Blood in stool and urine</p>
<p>When there is blood in the stool, it is caused by heat and blockage in the large intestine, leading to injury. When the body’s energy is harmed, wind pathogens can enter; this may lead to accumulation of heat, cold, or damp toxins affecting the spleen and stomach. When hot and cold interact, and dampness and toxins coexist, the blood and energy within become disturbed, stagnating and unable to return, seeping into the intestines, hence the blood in the stool. Additionally, internal abdominal bloating from cold can also cause blood to appear in the stool. Furthermore, if wind and cold invade a defenseless body, they can enter the spleen and stomach, or if there is stagnant blood in the intestines and stomach, damp toxins similar to bean juice can appear, which, along with damaging sweet foods to the organs, can result in blood in the stool. If heat accumulates in the upper body, affecting the heart and spleen, it can also lead to blood in the stool. Losing blood will result in weakness of the spleen leading to thirst; over time, this will cause blood deficiency, and the person’s body may become emaciated and yellow, with hair losing its color.</p>
<p>Blood in urine is associated with the heart, which governs blood through its connection with the small intestine. The flow of blood circulates through the meridians and organs; if heat accumulates in the bladder, blood can seep into the urine, leading to blood in the urine. It is said: the lungs command the energy of the hundred channels, while the liver governs the blood of the various meridians. It is also stated: qi governs the breath, while blood regulates the moisture.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Blood nourishes the body&#39;s essence and vital energy, irrigating the five organs and six bowels, as well as the limbs and bones. If the spleen and stomach are injured, and the nourishing and protective energies are weak and lose their normal function, it can lead to upper manifestations like nosebleeds and vomiting of blood, and lower manifestations like blood in urine and stools. If external wind pathogens invade, the blood is fresh and reflects intestinal wind; if there is internal injury, the blood is turbid, indicating internal toxins. Additionally, when heat enters the large intestine, it results in blood in the stools; if heat enters the small intestine, it leads to blood in the urine.</p>
<p>In children, this often occurs due to acquired heat in the womb, or from the nurse consuming unhealthy foods or experiencing emotional turmoil, leading to the accumulation of heat, or from the child consuming rich foods that generate heat. If the issue is due to the nurse&#39;s rich diet, administer a modified Clear Stomach Powder. For liver heat from anger, use a modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If the child is affected by worries or anger, apply a modified Gui Pi Decoction. For those with a hereditary dryness from the father&#39;s kidney function, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. </p>
<p>If a child has accumulated heat leading to blood in the urine, administer Clear Heart Lotus Seed Drink for excess heat or Liu Wei Di Huang Wan for deficiency heat. For blood in the stools, use Xijiao Di Huang Tang; if wind pathogens are externally invading, use Canglin Powder. If the vital energy is depleted after illness, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If blood is observed before defecation, use Si Jun Zi Decoction plus Huang Lian to control Wu Zhu Yu; if blood is seen after defecation, apply Si Jun Zi Decoction plus Wu Zhu Yu to manage Huang Lian. For infants, prioritize treatment of the mother, with further adjustments made according to the specific case.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Mute</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: the tongue is the instrument of sound; the throat is the gate of sound. When a child suddenly becomes voiceless, it is due to cold air invading the pharynx, causing it to be unable to produce sounds, and thus the door is closed and cannot open, resulting in no sound. If the throat&#39;s voice remains normal but the tongue cannot articulate words, this is termed as &quot;tongue mute.&quot; This is caused by the invasion of cold wind in the network of the spleen, or it may be affected in the sublingual area known as the &quot;Lianquan point.&quot; The tongue is essentially a sprout of the heart; the heart gives rise to sound through speech, but the blockage caused by wind pathogens obstructs the meridians, preventing the tongue from functioning. If the tongue is inherently unable to articulate words but there is hoarseness in the throat, this is termed as &quot;throat mute.&quot; This too is caused by the invasion of cold wind, resulting in obstructed airways, thus rendering the voice unable to be produced and the throat silent.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>There may be blockages from wind-phlegm, or due to the deficiency of heart qi, or because the spleen&#39;s channels are affected by wind, or because wind-phlegm stagnates in the spleen&#39;s channels, or due to insufficient spleen qi, or because clear qi from the stomach does not rise; all of these can lead to mutism. Generally, this condition can arise from a congenital deficiency of kidney qi, resulting in an inability to speak; there may be remnants of the mother’s five emotions&#39; fire affecting the child, sealing the clear pathways and preventing speech; or the child may suffer from exhaustion of body fluids, leading to dryness of the epiglottis, and thus cannot speak; or it may be due to insufficient kidney qi, with virtual fire injuring the lungs, resulting in speech loss; or there may be convulsions and apoplexy causing mutism. If there is residual heat with fluid depletion, use the Seven Flavor Atractylodes Powder. If clear qi does not rise, use the Honghua Qiwen Decoction. In cases of kidney deficiency along with virtual fire harming the lungs, use the Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill. If there is coughing with head tilting, emaciation, prominence of the sclera, or additional symptoms like head shaking, yawning, and teeth grinding, it is indicative of kidney deficiency, and only the Rehmannia Pill can provide relief.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Sudden Loss of Voice</strong></p>
<p>Chao says: The throat is the pathway of qi; the larynx is the gate of sound. When the gate is exposed to extreme cold, the cold affects the larynx, and when it encounters this chill, one is suddenly unable to produce sound, resulting in a sudden loss of voice. If one cannot speak, it is not due to locked jaws preventing sound.</p>
<p><strong>Voiceless After Illness</strong></p>
<p>Qian discusses a condition of kidney deficiency leading to a similar loss of voice. After vomiting and diarrhea, or after a serious illness, one may still make sounds but cannot speak, yet can swallow medicine. This is not a true loss of voice; it is due to kidney deficiency failing to connect with the yang. Therefore, the Kidney Nourishing Pills are indicated. A true loss of voice arises from a sudden illness.</p>
<p><strong>Epilepsy and Voicelessness</strong></p>
<p>Chao states in &quot;Sources of Illness&quot;: If a child has epilepsy and becomes voiceless after six or seven years old, it is a sign of wind epilepsy. At this time, the mouth and eyes may be affected, with symptoms like eye rolling or spasms in the hands and feet, rigid back, or bent neck, all resulting from a child catching a chill due to improper dressing while breastfeeding. If one&#39;s voice is lost after an epilepsy episode, it is due to wind. Excessive sweating from heavy clothing and overexposure to wind leads to this condition. Initially, the fingers may bend as if counting, followed by spasms. The voice arises from the heart, opening at the mouth. Although the epilepsy may cease, the lingering cold wind obstructs the heart&#39;s pathways, causing unrest in the heart qi, leading to the inability to speak.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Sleeplessness</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: Yangming corresponds to the stomach channel. The stomach is the sea of the six fu organs, and its energy flows downwards. When yangming is reversed and cannot follow its course, one cannot sleep. It is also said that if the stomach is not harmonious, sleeping will be restless. The protective energy of the human body moves in yang during the day and in yin at night. Yang is active, while yin is still. When awake, the soul, spirit, and intention scatter among the organs, manifest in the ears and eyes, and move in the limbs, directing the body’s actions; when asleep, the spirit and energy return to the five palaces for restful operation. If the spleen and stomach energy is robust, the organs harmonize, and the essence of food and water melds together to form a balanced energy. If the stomach&#39;s energy is reversed, then the qi and blood are misaligned, the organs are unsettled, and the symptoms of sleeplessness arise from this. One should use Si Junzi Tang, Yuan Zhi, or Suan Zao Ren. For liver and kidney yin deficiency with heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For insufficiency of heart blood, use Zhen Zhu Mu Wan. For excessive contemplation, use Gui Pi Tang. For lack of spirit and energy, use Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang. For residual heat after illness, use Suan Zao Ren Tang. For gallbladder deficiency preventing sleep, use Ren Shen Zhu Ye Tang. For unsettled liver fire, use Jia Wei Xiao Chai Hu Tang. For palpitations preventing sleep, use Si Junzi, ginger, and Suan Zao Ren. For night crying and restlessness, each case should be examined separately, and one should seek appropriate remedies.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p>
<h3>Unending Laughter</h3>
<p>The Classic states: When the heart harbors an excess of spirit, laughter is unending. It also says: In the organs, it pertains to the heart; in sound, it pertains to laughter; in will, it pertains to joy. Furthermore, when fire is excessive, it is called &quot;hexi,&quot; which signifies illness marked by rampant laughter and arrogance. It is also said that the arrival of Shaoyin brings joy and laughter. Additionally, when pure essence merges with the heart, joy arises. All these describe the fire of the heart. </p>
<p>If laughter is unending and accompanied by pain in the abdomen, this signifies water overpowering fire, with yin attacking yang, causing yang to conceal heat which leads to madness and nonsensical speech—this harms the heart. Bian Que states: A person with red lips and mouth may be treated; one with a blue-black complexion is near death. If the kidney&#39;s water is deficient and cannot counterbalance the heart&#39;s fire, leading to unending laughter, use the Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill. If liver fire is blazing, generating heart fire and causing unending laughter, use the Chai Hu Qing Gan Powder. For other cases, each should be treated according to its particular symptoms.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Continuing Illness</p>
<p>Continuing illness refers to the phenomenon where illnesses are passed on from others who are close, hence it is called a continuing illness. In women, the vital essence and blood rise to form breast milk and descend to constitute menstrual flow. When infants drink breast milk and become ill, one must consider that their larger form has already flourished in the womb, and the excretion of milk is evident; how could this fail to make the child ill? Thus, there is no blame to be placed on gods or spirits! The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; mentions that roasting and chewing to feed the child will not nourish the vital essence and blood of a pregnant woman, leading only to the ruinous detachment of birds and beasts. The ocean&#39;s depths say: sitting refers to continuing illness, while death refers to the transmission of corpses. When there is a pulse but no vital essence, it is called corpse rigor; when there is a vital essence but no pulse, it is called wandering corpse. Ding Xi, nursing exposure, strange guests, and unwarranted misfortune are four distinct illnesses. Yang Yi, Yin Yi, lily, and fox allure are four extraordinary illnesses.</p>
<p>Thirst</p>
<p>According to the ancients, there are three types of thirst:<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, there is real heat accumulating in the heart and spleen, causing restlessness and great thirst, requiring Bai Hu Decoction. This occurs suddenly and does not stem from vomiting or severe illness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, this is due to a prolonged illness or excessive transition causing spleen deficiency, leading to thirst, which requires Bai Zhu San.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Third, this is caused by damp-heat disease, with heat binding the bladder, making urination difficult, and great thirst, accompanied by both exterior and interior symptoms, which requires Wu Ling San.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to &quot;Bai Jian,&quot; if a child&#39;s lips are red like cinnabar, they are thirsty; if they are very red and blackened, it indicates a grave condition. If there is thirst due to vacuity in the three burners, use San Huang Tang. After febrile disease, if the lips and mouth are scorched, use Bai Hu Tang or Zhu Ye Tang. If diarrhea causes thirst, use Si Ling San or similar types to treat summer heat accumulation. For heart and spleen dryness and thirst, use Bai Hu Tang. For diarrhea and spleen deficiency causing thirst, use Qi Wei Bai Zhu San.</p>
<p>If there is heat binding the bladder and thirst with constipation, use Wu Ling San. For vacuity heat in the upper burner, use Si Jun Zi Tang. For excessive heat from rich food, use Qing Wei San. For heat accumulation in the spleen and stomach, use Xie Huang San. For middle qi deficiency heat, use Yi Gong San. For kidney water deficiency heat, use Liu Wei Wan. For other types of fever caused by malnutrition, refer to the original diagnosis. Conditions resulting from fetal endowment should be examined according to their causes. If one rashly uses cold and cooling methods to reduce heat, and harms the spleen and stomach instead, it can lead to abdominal distension and a grave condition.</p>
<p>Hai Zang states: to treat thirst, use Si Jun Zi Tang with added kudzu root and loquat leaves. First, boil the dried kudzu in jujube soup, then mix equal parts and add a bit of papaya, then decoct and take, as this also treats thirst due to deficiency.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Damp Heat</strong></p>
<p>According to the discussion on the pulse concerning children&#39;s thirst disorders, most suffer from abdominal swelling and diarrhea. This condition arises from heat in the heart, which is connected to the small intestine. When the small intestine is overheated, its qi ascends and rushes towards the stomach, causing the child to drink water. However, this water, attempting to enter the small intestine, is impeded by the heat of the small intestine’s qi and fails to be absorbed, thus flowing into the large intestine. To treat this, one should first administer a diuretic, then follow with cooling remedies for the heart, and only then can one alleviate the thirst. This corresponds to the Wu Ling San formula.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Tailbone Pain</strong></p>
<p>Severe pain is attributed to phlegm; use Erchen Decoction with Mu Xiang, Chen Pi, Qian Hu, Huang Bo, and Zhi Mu. If the pain occurs in the Yin area, it relates to Yin deficiency with damp-heat; use Liu Wei Wang with Dang Gui, Niu Xi, Fang Ji, Huang Bo, Zhi Mu, Rou Gui, and Hong Hua.</p>

<p>Medical Case</p>
<p>Zhang Congzheng’s “Rumen Shiqin” states: A young boy from the local magistrate in Chenzhou suddenly fell ill and did not awaken. One day, various doctors diagnosed him as suffering from night terrors; some suggested moxibustion while others recommended the use of the Great Fright Pills and mercury cakes for treatment. His father said: This child is normally healthy. Why did he suddenly become frightened? Because of the boy’s condition, he consulted a doctor named Dai. Dai checked both wrists and found the pulse to be calm and harmonious. Dai said: The pulse for fright should be strong and vigorous, but now it is calm; it is not fright. Dai discreetly asked the wet nurse: Did you drink alcohol three days ago? The wet nurse laughed and replied: Three days ago, the lady brought cooked wine as a gift; it was very tasty, and I drank one jar and fell asleep. The sweet and rich taste of the aged wine settled in my chest, causing the wine’s aroma to fill my milk, and the child became drunk as well. They then ground licorice, dried kudzu flowers, lesser cardamom, and guan zhong, brewed them into a juice for him to drink, and he immediately woke up.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>A young child swallowed a copper coin, which became lodged in the throat, unable to move up or down. All the doctors were unable to retrieve it, nor could it be swallowed down. They decided to use a contraption. The person who was knowledgeable in such matters contemplated carefully and suddenly devised a method. They used clean white paper to roll it into a shape like a chopstick, and with a knife, they made numerous cuts at one end to create a jagged shape. They also attached a pointed hook to that end, ensuring it wouldn&#39;t come loose. It was first inserted into the throat, lightly lifted and pressed down to feel if the hook penetrated the hole of the coin. Then, they placed the rolled paper into the throat, with the tip of the hook resting against it, feeling the hook tip enter the end of the rolled paper without injuring the tissues. They pulled it out successfully.</p>
<p>Wang Lun in &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Famous Physicians&quot; said: Yang Yongxing’s son, aged seven, had prolonged issues with loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea, accompanied by disturbed sleep and fright during sleep; he had not improved despite long treatment. I diagnosed that excessive sleep indicates a deficiency in the spleen, while excessive fright points to a deficiency in the heart’s blood. The heart is the mother, and the spleen is the child. The heart fire was unable to nourish the spleen soil. I treated him with “BaZhongYiQi Decoction” and “LiuWeiDihuang Wan” with added deer antler, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In &quot;Xue’s Medical Cases,&quot; it is noted: A treatment for a young child who spoke slowly and suffered from diarrhea, had a muted voice. Various cooling herbs were used, yet his voice remained hoarse. He had little appetite and often thought about food in the early morning. In the morning, he took “Dihuang Wan” with added Schisandra berries, and in the evening, he consumed “BaZhongYiQi Decoction”; his diarrhea quickly ceased. After that, he continued taking the former pill, and in less than two months, his speech gradually became clearer and he fully recovered.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>A young child had more white in the eyes than black, and after experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, suffered from a hoarse throat and thirst, with loose stools. They took Dihuang Pills continuously morning and night and recovered. Later, the diarrhea recurred and the hoarseness returned, but continued taking the same pills led to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had high fever and vomited blood, occasionally accompanied by a nosebleed, with a red face. This was due to accumulated heat in the lungs and stomach. They took Jisheng Xijiao Dihuang Decoction in four doses, and the bleeding stopped. Later, due to the mother drinking alcohol, the symptoms recurred. A remedy called Qing Wei San was used, and both mother and child took it, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>One child had persistent vomiting of blood and a red nose. It was found that the wet nurse had accumulated heat. With the use of a modified Gui Pi Decoction and a modified Xiao Yao San, both the mother and child took several doses, which led to a reduction in bleeding; then Ba Zhen Tang was used with Chai Hu and Mu Dan Pi, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A child suffered from fever and vomiting of blood due to frequent anger from the mother, experiencing occasional nosebleeds. Treatment with modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction helped both mother and child recover. Later, the mother, due to labor and anger, caused the child to suffer from seizures. They used Baolong Wan and blood was vomited again. I provided modified Xiao Yao San, and both mother and child recovered. After that, the wet nurse continued laboring and developed a fever, leading to the child experiencing seizures, vomiting blood, or having nosebleeds. The mother used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction while the child received Xijiao Dihuang Decoction, and they promptly recovered.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>A ten-year-old boy, due to excessive eating and injury, vomited blood. He was treated with a decoction of rhino horn and rehmannia to counteract food poison and clear stomach heat; he also received Shijun Decoction and peony root, along with angelica to replenish his spleen and stomach, eventually recovering. However, he still felt fatigued, experiencing numbness in both hands, for which he took several doses of astragalus and peony decoction and felt at ease.</p>
<p>Another boy vomited blood as his wet nurse suffered from heat distress, causing pain in his sides and leading to blood vomiting. The treatment involved a modified Gui Pi Decoction with Wuzhuyu to control the mother&#39;s heat, while he received several spoonfuls daily. After a month, he fully recovered. Later, due to the mother&#39;s anger, she experienced blood vomiting along with chills and fever, and the boy also vomited blood. Initially, the modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction was used in two doses, followed by a modified Xiao Yao San for the mother, resulting in the recovery of both.</p>
<p>A fourteen-year-old girl experienced convulsions from shock after being cold and feverish, and after taking tranquilizers, she vomited blood. Soon after, her clothes felt tight, her body was like fire, and she was restless and unable to sleep, with no appetite. Her pulse was forceful and erratic, and on palpation, it felt hollow and empty. She was treated with two doses of modified Ba Wei Pill, and all symptoms subsided. Her pulse became as fine as silk, with no vitality for movement. When ginseng was decocted alone at one liang, it wasn&#39;t effective, so another dose of one liang of ginseng and five fen of aconite was given, rapidly restoring her vital energy.</p>
<p>A thirteen-year-old girl vomited blood from anger, grinding her teeth and experiencing convulsions. She was treated with a modified Xiao Yao San plus vines for calming and eventually recovered. The following year, she married. However, she experienced emotional distress, fullness in her chest, reduced appetite, and blood vomiting with a flushed face, all resulting from liver fire and heat in the blood, while her spleen’s qi was deficient and unable to contain the blood. She was treated with Liu Wei Wan and Gui Pi Decoction, adding gardenia and fritillaria, leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>A young boy, fourteen years old, experienced fever and hemoptysis, attributed to deficiency of the three yin of the lower body. I proposed the use of the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish the source of digestion, but was disregarded; he continued to take cold and cooling measures to reduce fire, and his symptoms worsened. Some said: &quot;The child has no maturity; how could there be kidney deficiency? Why use ginseng and astragalus to tonify qi?&quot; I referenced Master Danxi, who said: &quot;The kidneys govern storage, while the liver governs smooth flow. Both organs contain corresponding fire, which connects to the heart. The heart is the sovereign fire, and when affected by external factors, the corresponding fire may rise even without direct connection, leading to depletion of essence.” Furthermore, Zhu noted: “If a man&#39;s essence is not mature and he discharges it to connect with a female, the five organs may be incomplete, and there could be difficult conditions later on.” It was precisely this situation. Therefore, I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Wang Shaocan&#39;s granddaughter, twelve years old, had a naturally weak spleen and stomach, later developing symptoms of malnutrition, with fever and a distended, hard abdomen, loose stools, wheezing, coughing, and restlessness throughout the night with nasal congestion, dark eyes, and incoherent speech. Her pulse was large and without root. I used one tael of ginseng and three fen of aconite; the abdominal distension gradually decreased, and the pulse began to stabilize. However, she still seemed weak. In addition, there was nasal bleeding, treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan for two doses as if she had collapsed. I then used Renshen Jiang Fu Decoction during the day and the Di Huang Wan at night; her pulse gradually gained strength, and her symptoms improved. I further administered Liu Jun Zi Tang and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, leading to a complete recovery.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>A young child stopped eating and experienced abdominal distress at night, taking a digestive pill and having several bowel movements, soon appearing pale with a complexion of green-yellow or white. This indicates damage to the spleen (earth element) and confinement of the lungs (metal element), with excess liver fire causing these symptoms. First, use Yigong Powder with an addition of Shengma to replenish the spleen, and then administer Liuwei Dihuang Pills to nourish the liver blood. After some stabilization, give each two doses and gradually improve; then employ Buzhong Yiqi Decoction and Liuwei Dihuang Pills, alternating with Yigong Powder until recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had a knee abscess that bled significantly after an accidental touch, presenting initial symptoms of chills and a pale face. This reflects a deficiency of yang following the dispersion of yin, leading to a state of cold. Administer Shiquan Dabu Decoction with three fen of Fuzi for four doses, with no immediate response; then use one liang of Ginseng, five fen of Fuzi, ginger, and jujube, prepared and taken as a decoction, which led to slight stabilization; after two more doses, the condition receded; in the morning, use Yigong Powder, and in the evening, employ Bajin Decoction for stabilization.</p>
<p>Another child, after sweating due to a cold invasion, exhibited symptoms of chills, a pale face, and cold hands and feet. For this, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with five-flavor fruit, stopping the sweating immediately, and gradually resolving other symptoms; after four doses, they stabilized; then administer Shiquan Dabu Decoction for complete recovery.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>A young child often laughed but was restless, with a red face from drinking cold water, and warm hands and feet. First, Huanglian Jiemi Decoction was given, and after two doses, there was some improvement; then, Liuwuwei Dihuang Pills were used, which quickly cured the child. Regular consumption of these pills kept the child calm, but after a month of not taking them, symptoms recurred. Upon taking them again, the child was healed.</p>
<p>A young child showed symptoms of a bluish-red face, which was caused by wind-heat affecting the liver and heart meridians. After using Chaihu Zhizi Powder and gradually administering Liuwuwei Dihuang Pills, the child improved. Additionally, due to the wet nurse&#39;s great anger causing a fever, Chaimu Decoction was first given, followed by Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder. Both mother and child took these and were cured.</p>
<p>A fourteen-year-old boy, over-exerting himself and eating irregularly, laughed incessantly. His pulse was strong yet fragile, and his complexion was red and sometimes pale. I used Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, and he was cured. Later, during the autumn imperial examination, after over-exertion and fatigue, symptoms recurred, accompanied by confusion. His pulse was strong yet faint; using one tael of ginseng and decocting it with ginger and jujube brought some relief, and after three doses, he was cured. Additionally, due to fatigue and mental strain, he experienced spontaneous sweating, thirst, and restlessness, resembling epilepsy. First, I used two doses of Danggui Blood Supplement Decoction for immediate relief, followed by Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, and he soon recovered.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child collapsed from fear at the sound of thunder, being unaware of his surroundings, indicating weakness due to fear. I used two taels each of ginseng, angelica, and ophiopogon, five qian of schisandra, with one dou of water, decocting to yield five sheng of liquid. After that, an additional five sheng of water was used to extract the residue, resulting in one sheng of juice, which was combined to make a paste. Each dose consisted of three spoonfuls, diluted in clear water. After consuming one sheng, the child became unaffected by the sound of thunder thereafter.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　小儿九道出血，何为而然？盖人之所有者，血与气也。心者血之主，肺者气之主，气主呴之，血主濡之，荣养百骸，灌溉丝脉，升降上下，荣卫谐和，自然顺适，一或不调，疾由生矣。或外为六淫所侵，内因七情所沮，气乃留而不行，血乃壅而不濡，内外抑郁，不能流注以荣于身，必有妄动之患。叔和以芤脉为失血之义，在七表属阳故也。阳明主乎多气多血，未有不因热而得，盖气血俱热，热郁内逼，失其常度，是以妄行。　　有在襁褓患此证者，固非七情所伤，皆因乳母执着，不自宽释，及咬辛辣之物，流于乳络，儿饮之后，停滞不散，郁蒸于内，亦能动血。或居重帏暖阁，火气熏逼，不令常见风日，积温成热，热极则涌泄，或吐或衄，大小腑亦多血来者。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　有气虚而邪热乘之，则血不能循流故道，渗于诸经，亦生走失之证。其面晄白，脉沉微，血淡紫，口气缓是也。　　又况婴孩脆弱，易虚易实。因热内攻，血随气行，或壅而上逆，或下而忘返，遂有吐血、衄血、泻血、溺血之证。然而血不苟动，因气使之；风不自生，因热而起。由是而论，可以类推。治法先明虚实，审得病源，随经施治，药饵无差，则不失其机要。　　实则小柴胡汤加生地黄、丝茅根，或苦参亦好，并用水煎服；或(口父)咀五苓散合五和汤，亦加丝茅根、苦参水煎；及投消毒饮。次用局方鸡苏丸、三黄丸间服。　　虚则理中汤及人参芎归汤，皆可服。间有医者，见其血盛，以为热极，过投凉剂，遂使血寒不能归源而妄流，其色紫黯而凝滞，或成小片，当服姜、附之剂以温之，自然流畅，毋致妄行为佳。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　　　　吐血</p>

<p><strong>Evil Spirits</strong>     </p>
<p>It is stated that the reason children suffer from evil spirits (鬾) is because a woman during pregnancy is influenced by malevolent spirits that affect the fetus in her womb, causing jealousy towards other children and leading to illness. The term &quot;鬾&quot; refers to minor ghosts. A pregnant woman does not need to attract these spirits directly; sometimes, they manifest on their own. The symptoms of this illness include mild diarrhea, alternating cold and heat, and discomfort in the hair and beard, which are indicative signs. It is recommended to take Longdan Decoction. If a woman has a child that is still unable to walk and then becomes pregnant again, causing the infant to drink her milk, this can also lead to evil spirits (鬾). This results in the child appearing yellow and emaciated, with hair loss and high fever, which are further signs of the illness.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Pediatric Direct Prescriptions (Song Dynasty - Qian Yi)</h3>
<h4>Aphasia</h4>
<p>If the child suffers from vomiting and diarrhea, or after defecation may have sound but is unable to speak, yet can swallow, it is not a loss of voice but a deficiency in the kidneys that fails to connect with the yang. One should treat it with the Rehmannia Pill. If the mouth remains tightly shut, phrases will be lost and speech will be slow. Note: This condition often arises from inherited kidney deficiency. The kidney meridian is connected to the root of the tongue; only the Rehmannia Pill can treat it. Therefore, in cases of this symptom, if they tilt their head back and cough, yet are unresponsive, one should also use the Middle-Boosting and Qi-Enhancing Decoction to nourish the source of transformation. If there is upward flaming of yin fire, harming the lung metal and causing loss of voice, it should also be treated by the previous method. The &quot;Infant Care Collection&quot; states: For children aged five to six with insufficient kidney energy resulting in speech inability, use the Sweet Flag Pill; for those with tightly sealed mouths unable to speak, use the Rehmannia Pill.</p>
<h3>Confucian Respect for Parents (Yuan Dynasty - Zhang Congzheng)</h3>
<h4>Paralysis</h4>
<p>For children, the combination of wind, dampness, and cold leads to paralysis, causing numbness in hands and feet. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: when the nutrients are deficient and the protective energy is strong, the skin can become numb, resulting in paralysis without awareness of itch or pain. One can use the Turmeric Powder to expel it, then take the Water-Promoting Pill, using mild cold medicines to purge it; after purging, apply warm pungent prescriptions to disperse. Once sweating occurs, regular consumption of Angelica, Peony, Aconite, and Myrrh with menstruating blood-nourishing medicines will ensure recovery.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>Today, when the infant was breastfeeding, the mother was pregnant. The child has a darkened brow, suffers from diarrhea, and is yellow and thin. This illness is commonly referred to as &#39;record.&#39; The &quot;Erya Yi&quot; states that the magpie can heal the subsequent disease. The subsequent disease refers to an illness where the mother is pregnant while nursing a child, causing the child to become ill as if suffering from a depletion.</p>

<p><strong>Liver Disease</strong></p>
<p>Cao Shi says: When children suffer from liver disease, if a woman has a child who is not yet able to walk, and becomes pregnant again, this results in the child gradually becoming thin and bony, with sparse, yellow hair that does not grow long. The child often has fevers and irregular bowel movements; this is called liver disease. It is also stated: For treating subsequent disease, one should use the Zishuang Pills to reduce the liver milk, benefiting the Yellow Powder to supplement it, ensuring the child can wean successfully. The Xiaoru Pills and the Yigong Powder are also excellent remedies. If other women are pregnant and nurse other people&#39;s infants, they could also manifest this condition, treated in the same way. For those with heat symptoms, Longdan Decoction is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Compendium of Materia Medica</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Li Shizhen)</p>
<p><strong>Subsequent Disease</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Huainanzi,&quot; it is said: A man may cultivate beautiful orchids but they do not bloom, just as a stepchild may receive rich food but does not thrive; there is no mutual affection. This is because the feelings are tied to the child in the womb. The subsequent disease is also referred to as liver disease, where &#39;liver&#39; is the name for a minor ghost, indicating that the child is thin and weak like a ghost. Generally, it is a type of consumption illness.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Mind of a Physician, Miscellaneous Writings by Wang Lun</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Infants’ Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Infants often sleep well, which indicates a deficiency of the spleen leading to fatigue; there is no need to use the Warm Gallbladder Decoction. If they wake in fright and are restless, this suggests a deficiency of heart blood causing heat disturbance. A weak heart leads to fright; thus, it is advisable to clear the heart and calm the mind, nourishing the blood and reducing phlegm. If there is phlegm obstructing the chest, it can also cause fright; additionally, if the spleen and stomach are harmed, leading to stagnation, they too may experience restlessness. This again indicates issues related to the spleen, stomach, and phlegm, not simply heart blood. It is necessary to digest food and transform phlegm; clearing phlegm allows for the nourishment of the spleen and stomach. </p>
<p><strong>Notes: If the symptoms are due to deficiency of heart and spleen qi with phlegm, it is appropriate to use ginseng, atractylodes, poria, and five-flavor herb to replenish heart qi, with angelica, peony, and jujube seed to nourish heart blood, and tangerine peel and pinellia to resolve phlegm stagnation. If there’s deficiency of spleen and lung qi with phlegm in the chest, use the Renown-Enhancing Decoction to tonify middle qi, and use gallbladder star and forsythia to transform phlegm. If symptoms arise from food stagnation, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction to strengthen the spleen and stomach, with hawthorn and spirit food to digest food and drink. If the child sleeps well due to spleen deficiency, the Five-Flavor Adaptable Powder can be used to tonify spleen qi, along with angelica and peony to generate spleen blood. If the child is intoxicated from the mother’s drinking, use licorice and dried kudzu decoction to alleviate this; do not use the Four Gentlemen Decoction.</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Wang Kentang of the Ming Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Regarding Blood Loss Syndromes</strong>  </p>
<p>What causes children to bleed through the nine orifices? It is due to the essential substances in humans: blood and qi. The heart governs blood, while the lungs govern qi. Qi promotes respiration, and blood nourishes the body, irrigating the meridians, elevating and lowering, harmonizing the body’s defenses. When any of these functions are disturbed, illness arises. This disturbance may come from external influences or the internal strain of emotions, leading to stagnant qi and blood that cannot circulate properly to nourish the body, thus risking errant movements. </p>
<p>Shuhe noted that the loss of blood pertains to the &quot;kuao pulse,&quot; associating it with the yang of the seven surfaces. The yangming channel dominates in terms of abundant qi and blood and has not been free from heat, as both qi and blood become heated, leading to internal stagnation and manifesting as erratic actions. </p>
<p>In infants with this condition, it is certainly not due to emotional disturbances; it is mainly because the wet nurse is overly strict, failing to provide necessary comfort, or because of spiciness in her diet that affects the milk. When the child drinks this, the stagnation persists internally, causing internal heat that can stir the blood. Additionally, if the child is kept in a heavy, warm room without fresh air, the oppressive heat accumulates and can become intense, leading to eruptions like vomiting or nasal bleeding, with various internal organs exhibiting excessive blood flow.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block original">

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is a deficiency of qi and external heat invades it, the blood cannot flow along its proper path and seeps into various channels, leading to symptoms of loss of control. The complexion becomes pallid, the pulse is deep and faint, the blood is pale purple, and the breath is weak. </p>
<p>Moreover, infants are fragile, easily suffering from both deficiency and excess. Due to internal heat attacking, blood follows the qi and may be obstructed, either rising in rebellion or descending without return, resulting in symptoms such as vomiting blood, nasal bleeding, diarrhea with blood, and blood in urine. However, blood does not flow rashly; it acts under the influence of qi, and wind does not arise on its own but is caused by heat. Based on this analysis, one can draw general conclusions. </p>
<p>The treatment method must first clarify deficiency and excess, carefully identify the source of the illness, and then apply appropriate treatment according to the channels, ensuring that medicinal prescriptions are precise, thus not missing the crucial points. </p>
<p>For excess, one can use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Sheng Di Huang and Si Mao Gen, or Ku Shen, prepared with water. Alternatively, one can grind Wu Ling San with Wu He Tang, also adding Si Mao Gen and Ku Shen, and boil it in water; and then use Xiao Du Drink. Next, use formulated medicinal pills like Ji Su Wan and San Huang Wan intermittently. </p>
<p>For deficiency, Li Zhong Tang and Ren Shen Qi Zang Tang are both suitable. Occasionally, some practitioners, seeing the abundance of blood, mistakenly believe it to be excessive heat and consequently overgive cooling agents, causing the blood to cool and fail to return to its source and thus flow erratically, appearing dark purple and stagnant. This can lead to small aggregations. It is vital to administer warming agents like ginger and Fu Zi to restore smooth flow, avoiding unintended consequences.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Coughing Up Blood</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Discussion on Infants&quot; states: Coughing up blood occurs when the circulation of blood and qi is disturbed. &quot;Rong&quot; refers to blood, while &quot;Wei&quot; refers to qi. When blood and qi are in harmony, they maintain their normal pathway; if one gains the upper hand, it leads to errant behavior. Blood is akin to water; if directed east, it flows east, if directed west, it flows west. Qi directs blood, exerting its influence this way. The Nest teachers say: Blood is associated with heat; when qi is strong but blood is weak, the heat takes control of the blood, causing erratic flow. When qi is reversed, blood rises with it, leading to coughing up blood. Additionally, overindulgence in food can create internal cold in the spleen and stomach, hindering digestion, thus causing regurgitation of food, where the conflict between qi and blood can injure the lungs and stomach, also resulting in coughing up blood. Chronic coughing can cause qi to rise and lead to symptoms such as swollen eyes and coughing up blood, indicating deficiency. </p>
<p>Clear elements represent &quot;Rong,&quot; while turbid elements represent &quot;Wei.&quot; &quot;Rong&quot; flows within the channels, while &quot;Wei&quot; flows outside of them. Essentially, &quot;Rong&quot; is the essence derived from food and drink, harmoniously regulating the five organs and dispersing into the six bowels, thereby entering the channels. &quot;Rong&quot; is the yin blood, governed primarily by the heart, transformed within the spleen, stored in the liver, distributed through the lungs, and excreted through the kidneys, nourishing the entire body and sustaining the numerous channels. Hence, the control over blood is held by qi, which is why it is said that qi governs exhalation, while blood governs moisture.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, when the qi moves, the blood moves; when the qi stops, the blood stops. Yang generates while Yin grows; the husband and wife follow this principle. If the qi is harmed, it leads to a hundred changes in symptoms. Therefore, reckless actions can lead to vomiting and nosebleeds, decline leads to fatigue, descent leads to red stools, heat leads to red urine, infiltration in the intestines results in intestinal wind, and when Yin is deficient and Yang collides, it causes excessive bleeding. All of these indicate a disturbance in qi, while blood presents the problem of overflow. </p>
<p>However, can one nurture Yin without first understanding the way to nurture Yang? When children suffer, it is often due to inherent heat, or due to consuming rich foods, or from the emotional distress of the wet nurse. </p>
<p>For treatment, if there is qi deficiency and weak blood, one should supplement it with ginseng; if Yang is abundant, then Yin generates blood. The Si Wu Decoction can specifically address blood-related injuries and is effective if qi is not deficient. If the left cun pulse is rapid but weak, it indicates blood deficiency; one can add ginseng and atractylodes to Si Wu Decoction. If the pulse is floating and weak, it indicates qi deficiency; use the Ren Shen Bai Du San. If the pulse at the wrist is rapid or weak, it indicates kidney deficiency; use the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If the right cun pulse is rapid but strong, it suggests heat in the lungs and stomach; use the Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang, and then follow with Si Wu Decoction adding ginseng, poria, and atractylodes. If the pulse at the wrist is rapid and weak, it indicates Yin deficiency; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If one appears pale with yellow eyes and excessive drooling or numbness in the hands, it indicates spleen and lung deficiency; use Huang Qi Shao Yao Tang.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nasal Bleeding</strong></p>
<p>Nasal bleeding is caused by a heat accumulation in the five organs. Blood travels with the qi, flowing through the organs and channels. When the balance of hot and cold is maintained, there is no blockage and no overflow. When blood is exposed to cold, it coagulates; when exposed to heat, it disperses. Heat acts upon the blood, causing it to surge with the qi and overflow from the nasal passages. </p>
<p>Additionally, due to the effects of cold and pestilence, when yang energies are affected and sweat cannot be released, the heat has no outlet, hence it flows from the nose.</p>
<p>For nasal bleeding in spring and winter, use fresh rehmannia root, extract its juice, and mix it with a little fresh cattail pollen, adding sugar dissolved in well water to take. This will cure it.</p>
<p>For nasal bleeding in autumn and summer, take a handful of plantain leaves, wash them clean, and grind them together with fresh ginger to extract the juice. Add a spoonful of raw honey, mix the residue to plug the nose, and then drink the mixture of fresh spring water and honey with the plantain and ginger juice. This will also cure it.</p>
<p>Another remedy: take fresh radish, crush it to obtain natural juice, and drops it into the nasal passages while tilting the head back; this will stop the bleeding.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Blood in stool and urine</p>
<p>When there is blood in the stool, it is caused by heat and blockage in the large intestine, leading to injury. When the body’s energy is harmed, wind pathogens can enter; this may lead to accumulation of heat, cold, or damp toxins affecting the spleen and stomach. When hot and cold interact, and dampness and toxins coexist, the blood and energy within become disturbed, stagnating and unable to return, seeping into the intestines, hence the blood in the stool. Additionally, internal abdominal bloating from cold can also cause blood to appear in the stool. Furthermore, if wind and cold invade a defenseless body, they can enter the spleen and stomach, or if there is stagnant blood in the intestines and stomach, damp toxins similar to bean juice can appear, which, along with damaging sweet foods to the organs, can result in blood in the stool. If heat accumulates in the upper body, affecting the heart and spleen, it can also lead to blood in the stool. Losing blood will result in weakness of the spleen leading to thirst; over time, this will cause blood deficiency, and the person’s body may become emaciated and yellow, with hair losing its color.</p>
<p>Blood in urine is associated with the heart, which governs blood through its connection with the small intestine. The flow of blood circulates through the meridians and organs; if heat accumulates in the bladder, blood can seep into the urine, leading to blood in the urine.

When a child suddenly becomes voiceless, it is due to cold air invading the pharynx, causing it to be unable to produce sounds, and thus the door is closed and cannot open, resulting in no sound. If the throat&#39;s voice remains normal but the tongue cannot articulate words, this is termed as &quot;tongue mute.&quot; This is caused by the invasion of cold wind in the network of the spleen, or it may be affected in the sublingual area known as the &quot;Lianquan point.&quot; The tongue is essentially a sprout of the heart; the heart gives rise to sound through speech, but the blockage caused by wind pathogens obstructs the meridians, preventing the tongue from functioning. If the tongue is inherently unable to articulate words but there is hoarseness in the throat, this is termed as &quot;throat mute.&quot; This too is caused by the invasion of cold wind, resulting in obstructed airways, thus rendering the voice unable to be produced and the throat silent.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There may be blockages from wind-phlegm, or due to the deficiency of heart qi, or because the spleen&#39;s channels are affected by wind, or because wind-phlegm stagnates in the spleen&#39;s channels, or due to insufficient spleen qi, or because clear qi from the stomach does not rise; all of these can lead to mutism. Generally, this condition can arise from a congenital deficiency of kidney qi, resulting in an inability to speak; there may be remnants of the mother’s five emotions&#39; fire affecting the child, sealing the clear pathways and preventing speech; or the child may suffer from exhaustion of body fluids, leading to dryness of the epiglottis, and thus cannot speak; or it may be due to insufficient kidney qi, with virtual fire injuring the lungs, resulting in speech loss; or there may be convulsions and apoplexy causing mutism. If there is residual heat with fluid depletion, use the Seven Flavor Atractylodes Powder. If clear qi does not rise, use the Honghua Qiwen Decoction. In cases of kidney deficiency along with virtual fire harming the lungs, use the Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sudden Loss of Voice</strong></p>
<p>Chao says: The throat is the pathway of qi; the larynx is the gate of sound. When the gate is exposed to extreme cold, the cold affects the larynx, and when it encounters this chill, one is suddenly unable to produce sound, resulting in a sudden loss of voice. If one cannot speak, it is not due to locked jaws preventing sound.</p>
<p><strong>Voiceless After Illness</strong></p>
<p>Qian discusses a condition of kidney deficiency leading to a similar loss of voice. After vomiting and diarrhea, or after a serious illness, one may still make sounds but cannot speak, yet can swallow medicine. This is not a true loss of voice; it is due to kidney deficiency failing to connect with the yang. Therefore, the Kidney Nourishing Pills are indicated. A true loss of voice arises from a sudden illness.</p>
<p><strong>Epilepsy and Voicelessness</strong></p>
<p>Chao states in &quot;Sources of Illness&quot;: If a child has epilepsy and becomes voiceless after six or seven years old, it is a sign of wind epilepsy. At this time, the mouth and eyes may be affected, with symptoms like eye rolling or spasms in the hands and feet, rigid back, or bent neck, all resulting from a child catching a chill due to improper dressing while breastfeeding. If one&#39;s voice is lost after an epilepsy episode, it is due to wind. Excessive sweating from heavy clothing and overexposure to wind leads to this condition. Initially, the fingers may bend as if counting, followed by spasms. The voice arises from the heart, opening at the mouth. Although the epilepsy may cease, the lingering cold wind obstructs the heart&#39;s pathways, causing unrest in the heart qi, leading to the inability to speak.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sleeplessness</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: Yangming corresponds to the stomach channel. The stomach is the sea of the six fu organs, and its energy flows downwards. When yangming is reversed and cannot follow its course, one cannot sleep. It is also said that if the stomach is not harmonious, sleeping will be restless. The protective energy of the human body moves in yang during the day and in yin at night. Yang is active, while yin is still. When awake, the soul, spirit, and intention scatter among the organs, manifest in the ears and eyes, and move in the limbs, directing the body’s actions; when asleep, the spirit and energy return to the five palaces for restful operation. If the spleen and stomach energy is robust, the organs harmonize, and the essence of food and water melds together to form a balanced energy. If the stomach&#39;s energy is reversed, then the qi and blood are misaligned, the organs are unsettled, and the symptoms of sleeplessness arise from this. One should use Si Junzi Tang, Yuan Zhi, or Suan Zao Ren. For liver and kidney yin deficiency with heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For insufficiency of heart blood, use Zhen Zhu Mu Wan. For excessive contemplation, use Gui Pi Tang. For lack of spirit and energy, use Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang. For residual heat after illness, use Suan Zao Ren Tang. For gallbladder deficiency preventing sleep, use Ren Shen Zhu Ye Tang. For unsettled liver fire, use Jia Wei Xiao Chai Hu Tang. For palpitations preventing sleep, use Si Junzi, ginger, and Suan Zao Ren.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Unending Laughter</h3>
<p>The Classic states: When the heart harbors an excess of spirit, laughter is unending. It also says: In the organs, it pertains to the heart; in sound, it pertains to laughter; in will, it pertains to joy. Furthermore, when fire is excessive, it is called &quot;hexi,&quot; which signifies illness marked by rampant laughter and arrogance. It is also said that the arrival of Shaoyin brings joy and laughter. Additionally, when pure essence merges with the heart, joy arises. All these describe the fire of the heart. </p>
<p>If laughter is unending and accompanied by pain in the abdomen, this signifies water overpowering fire, with yin attacking yang, causing yang to conceal heat which leads to madness and nonsensical speech—this harms the heart. Bian Que states: A person with red lips and mouth may be treated; one with a blue-black complexion is near death. If the kidney&#39;s water is deficient and cannot counterbalance the heart&#39;s fire, leading to unending laughter, use the Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill. If liver fire is blazing, generating heart fire and causing unending laughter, use the Chai Hu Qing Gan Powder.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Continuing Illness</p>
<p>Continuing illness refers to the phenomenon where illnesses are passed on from others who are close, hence it is called a continuing illness. In women, the vital essence and blood rise to form breast milk and descend to constitute menstrual flow. When infants drink breast milk and become ill, one must consider that their larger form has already flourished in the womb, and the excretion of milk is evident; how could this fail to make the child ill? Thus, there is no blame to be placed on gods or spirits! The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; mentions that roasting and chewing to feed the child will not nourish the vital essence and blood of a pregnant woman, leading only to the ruinous detachment of birds and beasts. The ocean&#39;s depths say: sitting refers to continuing illness, while death refers to the transmission of corpses. When there is a pulse but no vital essence, it is called corpse rigor; when there is a vital essence but no pulse, it is called wandering corpse. Ding Xi, nursing exposure, strange guests, and unwarranted misfortune are four distinct illnesses. Yang Yi, Yin Yi, lily, and fox allure are four extraordinary illnesses.</p>

<li><p>First, there is real heat accumulating in the heart and spleen, causing restlessness and great thirst, requiring Bai Hu Decoction. This occurs suddenly and does not stem from vomiting or severe illness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, this is due to a prolonged illness or excessive transition causing spleen deficiency, leading to thirst, which requires Bai Zhu San.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Third, this is caused by damp-heat disease, with heat binding the bladder, making urination difficult, and great thirst, accompanied by both exterior and interior symptoms, which requires Wu Ling San.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to &quot;Bai Jian,&quot; if a child&#39;s lips are red like cinnabar, they are thirsty; if they are very red and blackened, it indicates a grave condition. If there is thirst due to vacuity in the three burners, use San Huang Tang. After febrile disease, if the lips and mouth are scorched, use Bai Hu Tang or Zhu Ye Tang. If diarrhea causes thirst, use Si Ling San or similar types to treat summer heat accumulation. For heart and spleen dryness and thirst, use Bai Hu Tang. For diarrhea and spleen deficiency causing thirst, use Qi Wei Bai Zhu San.</p>
<p>If there is heat binding the bladder and thirst with constipation, use Wu Ling San. For vacuity heat in the upper burner, use Si Jun Zi Tang. For excessive heat from rich food, use Qing Wei San. For heat accumulation in the spleen and stomach, use Xie Huang San. For middle qi deficiency heat, use Yi Gong San. For kidney water deficiency heat, use Liu Wei Wan. For other types of fever caused by malnutrition, refer to the original diagnosis. Conditions resulting from fetal endowment should be examined according to their causes. If one rashly uses cold and cooling methods to reduce heat, and harms the spleen and stomach instead, it can lead to abdominal distension and a grave condition.</p>
<p>Hai Zang states: to treat thirst, use Si Jun Zi Tang with added kudzu root and loquat leaves. First, boil the dried kudzu in jujube soup, then mix equal parts and add a bit of papaya, then decoct and take, as this also treats thirst due to deficiency.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Damp Heat</strong></p>
<p>According to the discussion on the pulse concerning children&#39;s thirst disorders, most suffer from abdominal swelling and diarrhea. This condition arises from heat in the heart, which is connected to the small intestine. When the small intestine is overheated, its qi ascends and rushes towards the stomach, causing the child to drink water. However, this water, attempting to enter the small intestine, is impeded by the heat of the small intestine’s qi and fails to be absorbed, thus flowing into the large intestine. To treat this, one should first administer a diuretic, then follow with cooling remedies for the heart, and only then can one alleviate the thirst. This corresponds to the Wu Ling San formula.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

One day, various doctors diagnosed him as suffering from night terrors; some suggested moxibustion while others recommended the use of the Great Fright Pills and mercury cakes for treatment. His father said: This child is normally healthy. Why did he suddenly become frightened? Because of the boy’s condition, he consulted a doctor named Dai. Dai checked both wrists and found the pulse to be calm and harmonious. Dai said: The pulse for fright should be strong and vigorous, but now it is calm; it is not fright. Dai discreetly asked the wet nurse: Did you drink alcohol three days ago? The wet nurse laughed and replied: Three days ago, the lady brought cooked wine as a gift; it was very tasty, and I drank one jar and fell asleep. The sweet and rich taste of the aged wine settled in my chest, causing the wine’s aroma to fill my milk, and the child became drunk as well.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child swallowed a copper coin, which became lodged in the throat, unable to move up or down. All the doctors were unable to retrieve it, nor could it be swallowed down. They decided to use a contraption. The person who was knowledgeable in such matters contemplated carefully and suddenly devised a method. They used clean white paper to roll it into a shape like a chopstick, and with a knife, they made numerous cuts at one end to create a jagged shape. They also attached a pointed hook to that end, ensuring it wouldn&#39;t come loose. It was first inserted into the throat, lightly lifted and pressed down to feel if the hook penetrated the hole of the coin. Then, they placed the rolled paper into the throat, with the tip of the hook resting against it, feeling the hook tip enter the end of the rolled paper without injuring the tissues. They pulled it out successfully.</p>

The heart fire was unable to nourish the spleen soil. I treated him with “BaZhongYiQi Decoction” and “LiuWeiDihuang Wan” with added deer antler, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In &quot;Xue’s Medical Cases,&quot; it is noted: A treatment for a young child who spoke slowly and suffered from diarrhea, had a muted voice. Various cooling herbs were used, yet his voice remained hoarse. He had little appetite and often thought about food in the early morning. In the morning, he took “Dihuang Wan” with added Schisandra berries, and in the evening, he consumed “BaZhongYiQi Decoction”; his diarrhea quickly ceased. After that, he continued taking the former pill, and in less than two months, his speech gradually became clearer and he fully recovered.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

I proposed the use of the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish the source of digestion, but was disregarded; he continued to take cold and cooling measures to reduce fire, and his symptoms worsened. Some said: &quot;The child has no maturity; how could there be kidney deficiency? Why use ginseng and astragalus to tonify qi?&quot; I referenced Master Danxi, who said: &quot;The kidneys govern storage, while the liver governs smooth flow. Both organs contain corresponding fire, which connects to the heart. The heart is the sovereign fire, and when affected by external factors, the corresponding fire may rise even without direct connection, leading to depletion of essence.” Furthermore, Zhu noted: “If a man&#39;s essence is not mature and he discharges it to connect with a female, the five organs may be incomplete, and there could be difficult conditions later on.” It was precisely this situation.

His pulse was strong yet faint; using one tael of ginseng and decocting it with ginger and jujube brought some relief, and after three doses, he was cured. Additionally, due to fatigue and mental strain, he experienced spontaneous sweating, thirst, and restlessness, resembling epilepsy. First, I used two doses of Danggui Blood Supplement Decoction for immediate relief, followed by Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, and he soon recovered.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child collapsed from fear at the sound of thunder, being unaware of his surroundings, indicating weakness due to fear. I used two taels each of ginseng, angelica, and ophiopogon, five qian of schisandra, with one dou of water, decocting to yield five sheng of liquid. After that, an additional five sheng of water was used to extract the residue, resulting in one sheng of juice, which was combined to make a paste. Each dose consisted of three spoonfuls, diluted in clear water. After consuming one sheng, the child became unaffected by the sound of thunder thereafter.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

The term \"鬾\" refers to minor ghosts. A pregnant woman does not need to attract these spirits directly; sometimes, they manifest on their own. The symptoms of this illness include mild diarrhea, alternating cold and heat, and discomfort in the hair and beard, which are indicative signs. It is recommended to take Longdan Decoction. If a woman has a child that is still unable to walk and then becomes pregnant again, causing the infant to drink her milk, this can also lead to evil spirits (鬾). This results in the child appearing yellow and emaciated, with hair loss and high fever, which are further signs of the illness."},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"### Pediatric Direct Prescriptions (Song Dynasty - Qian Yi) #### Aphasia If the child suffers from vomiting and diarrhea, or after defecation may have sound but is unable to speak, yet can swallow, it is not a loss of voice but a deficiency in the kidneys that fails to connect with the yang. One should treat it with the Rehmannia Pill. If the mouth remains tightly shut, phrases will be lost and speech will be slow. Note: This condition often arises from inherited kidney deficiency. The kidney meridian is connected to the root of the tongue; only the Rehmannia Pill can treat it. Therefore, in cases of this symptom, if they tilt their head back and cough, yet are unresponsive, one should also use the Middle-Boosting and Qi-Enhancing Decoction to nourish the source of transformation. If there is upward flaming of yin fire, harming the lung metal and causing loss of voice, it should also be treated by the previous method. The \"Infant Care Collection\" states: For children aged five to six with insufficient kidney energy resulting in speech inability, use the Sweet Flag Pill; for those with tightly sealed mouths unable to speak, use the Rehmannia Pill. ### Confucian Respect for Parents (Yuan Dynasty - Zhang Congzheng) #### Paralysis For children, the combination of wind, dampness, and cold leads to paralysis, causing numbness in hands and feet. The \"Inner Canon\" states: when the nutrients are deficient and the protective energy is strong, the skin can become numb, resulting in paralysis without awareness of itch or pain. One can use the Turmeric Powder to expel it, then take the Water-Promoting Pill, using mild cold medicines to purge it; after purging, apply warm pungent prescriptions to disperse.

The child has a darkened brow, suffers from diarrhea, and is yellow and thin. This illness is commonly referred to as 'record.' The \"Erya Yi\" states that the magpie can heal the subsequent disease. The subsequent disease refers to an illness where the mother is pregnant while nursing a child, causing the child to become ill as if suffering from a depletion. **Hundred Questions of Infants** (Ming Dynasty, Lu Bosi) **Liver Disease** Cao Shi says: When children suffer from liver disease, if a woman has a child who is not yet able to walk, and becomes pregnant again, this results in the child gradually becoming thin and bony, with sparse, yellow hair that does not grow long. The child often has fevers and irregular bowel movements; this is called liver disease. It is also stated: For treating subsequent disease, one should use the Zishuang Pills to reduce the liver milk, benefiting the Yellow Powder to supplement it, ensuring the child can wean successfully. The Xiaoru Pills and the Yigong Powder are also excellent remedies. If other women are pregnant and nurse other people's infants, they could also manifest this condition, treated in the same way. For those with heat symptoms, Longdan Decoction is recommended. **Compendium of Materia Medica** (Ming Dynasty, Li Shizhen) **Subsequent Disease** According to the \"Huainanzi,\" it is said: A man may cultivate beautiful orchids but they do not bloom, just as a stepchild may receive rich food but does not thrive; there is no mutual affection. This is because the feelings are tied to the child in the womb.

If they wake in fright and are restless, this suggests a deficiency of heart blood causing heat disturbance. A weak heart leads to fright; thus, it is advisable to clear the heart and calm the mind, nourishing the blood and reducing phlegm. If there is phlegm obstructing the chest, it can also cause fright; additionally, if the spleen and stomach are harmed, leading to stagnation, they too may experience restlessness. This again indicates issues related to the spleen, stomach, and phlegm, not simply heart blood. It is necessary to digest food and transform phlegm; clearing phlegm allows for the nourishment of the spleen and stomach. **Notes: If the symptoms are due to deficiency of heart and spleen qi with phlegm, it is appropriate to use ginseng, atractylodes, poria, and five-flavor herb to replenish heart qi, with angelica, peony, and jujube seed to nourish heart blood, and tangerine peel and pinellia to resolve phlegm stagnation. If there’s deficiency of spleen and lung qi with phlegm in the chest, use the Renown-Enhancing Decoction to tonify middle qi, and use gallbladder star and forsythia to transform phlegm. If symptoms arise from food stagnation, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction to strengthen the spleen and stomach, with hawthorn and spirit food to digest food and drink. If the child sleeps well due to spleen deficiency, the Five-Flavor Adaptable Powder can be used to tonify spleen qi, along with angelica and peony to generate spleen blood.

It is due to the essential substances in humans: blood and qi. The heart governs blood, while the lungs govern qi. Qi promotes respiration, and blood nourishes the body, irrigating the meridians, elevating and lowering, harmonizing the body’s defenses. When any of these functions are disturbed, illness arises. This disturbance may come from external influences or the internal strain of emotions, leading to stagnant qi and blood that cannot circulate properly to nourish the body, thus risking errant movements. Shuhe noted that the loss of blood pertains to the \"kuao pulse,\" associating it with the yang of the seven surfaces. The yangming channel dominates in terms of abundant qi and blood and has not been free from heat, as both qi and blood become heated, leading to internal stagnation and manifesting as erratic actions. In infants with this condition, it is certainly not due to emotional disturbances; it is mainly because the wet nurse is overly strict, failing to provide necessary comfort, or because of spiciness in her diet that affects the milk. When the child drinks this, the stagnation persists internally, causing internal heat that can stir the blood. Additionally, if the child is kept in a heavy, warm room without fresh air, the oppressive heat accumulates and can become intense, leading to eruptions like vomiting or nasal bleeding, with various internal organs exhibiting excessive blood flow."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"When there is a deficiency of qi and external heat invades it, the blood cannot flow along its proper path and seeps into various channels, leading to symptoms of loss of control. The complexion becomes pallid, the pulse is deep and faint, the blood is pale purple, and the breath is weak. Moreover, infants are fragile, easily suffering from both deficiency and excess. Due to internal heat attacking, blood follows the qi and may be obstructed, either rising in rebellion or descending without return, resulting in symptoms such as vomiting blood, nasal bleeding, diarrhea with blood, and blood in urine. However, blood does not flow rashly; it acts under the influence of qi, and wind does not arise on its own but is caused by heat. Based on this analysis, one can draw general conclusions. The treatment method must first clarify deficiency and excess, carefully identify the source of the illness, and then apply appropriate treatment according to the channels, ensuring that medicinal prescriptions are precise, thus not missing the crucial points. For excess, one can use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Sheng Di Huang and Si Mao Gen, or Ku Shen, prepared with water. Alternatively, one can grind Wu Ling San with Wu He Tang, also adding Si Mao Gen and Ku Shen, and boil it in water; and then use Xiao Du Drink. Next, use formulated medicinal pills like Ji Su Wan and San Huang Wan intermittently. For deficiency, Li Zhong Tang and Ren Shen Qi Zang Tang are both suitable. Occasionally, some practitioners, seeing the abundance of blood, mistakenly believe it to be excessive heat and consequently overgive cooling agents, causing the blood to cool and fail to return to its source and thus flow erratically, appearing dark purple and stagnant. This can lead to small aggregations. It is vital to administer warming agents like ginger and Fu Zi to restore smooth flow, avoiding unintended consequences."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"Coughing Up Blood The \"Complete Discussion on Infants\" states: Coughing up blood occurs when the circulation of blood and qi is disturbed. \"Rong\" refers to blood, while \"Wei\" refers to qi. When blood and qi are in harmony, they maintain their normal pathway; if one gains the upper hand, it leads to errant behavior. Blood is akin to water; if directed east, it flows east, if directed west, it flows west. Qi directs blood, exerting its influence this way. The Nest teachers say: Blood is associated with heat; when qi is strong but blood is weak, the heat takes control of the blood, causing erratic flow. When qi is reversed, blood rises with it, leading to coughing up blood. Additionally, overindulgence in food can create internal cold in the spleen and stomach, hindering digestion, thus causing regurgitation of food, where the conflict between qi and blood can injure the lungs and stomach, also resulting in coughing up blood. Chronic coughing can cause qi to rise and lead to symptoms such as swollen eyes and coughing up blood, indicating deficiency. Clear elements represent \"Rong,\" while turbid elements represent \"Wei.\" \"Rong\" flows within the channels, while \"Wei\" flows outside of them. Essentially, \"Rong\" is the essence derived from food and drink, harmoniously regulating the five organs and dispersing into the six bowels, thereby entering the channels. \"Rong\" is the yin blood, governed primarily by the heart, transformed within the spleen, stored in the liver, distributed through the lungs, and excreted through the kidneys, nourishing the entire body and sustaining the numerous channels. Hence, the control over blood is held by qi, which is why it is said that qi governs exhalation, while blood governs moisture."},{"anchor":"trans-8p","marker":"8p","type":"translation","text":"Thus, when the qi moves, the blood moves; when the qi stops, the blood stops. Yang generates while Yin grows; the husband and wife follow this principle. If the qi is harmed, it leads to a hundred changes in symptoms. Therefore, reckless actions can lead to vomiting and nosebleeds, decline leads to fatigue, descent leads to red stools, heat leads to red urine, infiltration in the intestines results in intestinal wind, and when Yin is deficient and Yang collides, it causes excessive bleeding. All of these indicate a disturbance in qi, while blood presents the problem of overflow. However, can one nurture Yin without first understanding the way to nurture Yang? When children suffer, it is often due to inherent heat, or due to consuming rich foods, or from the emotional distress of the wet nurse. For treatment, if there is qi deficiency and weak blood, one should supplement it with ginseng; if Yang is abundant, then Yin generates blood. The Si Wu Decoction can specifically address blood-related injuries and is effective if qi is not deficient. If the left cun pulse is rapid but weak, it indicates blood deficiency; one can add ginseng and atractylodes to Si Wu Decoction. If the pulse is floating and weak, it indicates qi deficiency; use the Ren Shen Bai Du San. If the pulse at the wrist is rapid or weak, it indicates kidney deficiency; use the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If the right cun pulse is rapid but strong, it suggests heat in the lungs and stomach; use the Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang, and then follow with Si Wu Decoction adding ginseng, poria, and atractylodes. If the pulse at the wrist is rapid and weak, it indicates Yin deficiency; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If one appears pale with yellow eyes and excessive drooling or numbness in the hands, it indicates spleen and lung deficiency; use Huang Qi Shao Yao Tang."},{"anchor":"trans-9p","marker":"9p","type":"translation","text":"**Nasal Bleeding** Nasal bleeding is caused by a heat accumulation in the five organs. Blood travels with the qi, flowing through the organs and channels. When the balance of hot and cold is maintained, there is no blockage and no overflow. When blood is exposed to cold, it coagulates; when exposed to heat, it disperses. Heat acts upon the blood, causing it to surge with the qi and overflow from the nasal passages. Additionally, due to the effects of cold and pestilence, when yang energies are affected and sweat cannot be released, the heat has no outlet, hence it flows from the nose. For nasal bleeding in spring and winter, use fresh rehmannia root, extract its juice, and mix it with a little fresh cattail pollen, adding sugar dissolved in well water to take. This will cure it. For nasal bleeding in autumn and summer, take a handful of plantain leaves, wash them clean, and grind them together with fresh ginger to extract the juice. Add a spoonful of raw honey, mix the residue to plug the nose, and then drink the mixture of fresh spring water and honey with the plantain and ginger juice. This will also cure it. Another remedy: take fresh radish, crush it to obtain natural juice, and drops it into the nasal passages while tilting the head back; this will stop the bleeding.

When hot and cold interact, and dampness and toxins coexist, the blood and energy within become disturbed, stagnating and unable to return, seeping into the intestines, hence the blood in the stool. Additionally, internal abdominal bloating from cold can also cause blood to appear in the stool. Furthermore, if wind and cold invade a defenseless body, they can enter the spleen and stomach, or if there is stagnant blood in the intestines and stomach, damp toxins similar to bean juice can appear, which, along with damaging sweet foods to the organs, can result in blood in the stool. If heat accumulates in the upper body, affecting the heart and spleen, it can also lead to blood in the stool. Losing blood will result in weakness of the spleen leading to thirst; over time, this will cause blood deficiency, and the person’s body may become emaciated and yellow, with hair losing its color. Blood in urine is associated with the heart, which governs blood through its connection with the small intestine. The flow of blood circulates through the meridians and organs; if heat accumulates in the bladder, blood can seep into the urine, leading to blood in the urine.

If the throat's voice remains normal but the tongue cannot articulate words, this is termed as \"tongue mute.\" This is caused by the invasion of cold wind in the network of the spleen, or it may be affected in the sublingual area known as the \"Lianquan point.\" The tongue is essentially a sprout of the heart; the heart gives rise to sound through speech, but the blockage caused by wind pathogens obstructs the meridians, preventing the tongue from functioning.

Generally, this condition can arise from a congenital deficiency of kidney qi, resulting in an inability to speak; there may be remnants of the mother’s five emotions' fire affecting the child, sealing the clear pathways and preventing speech; or the child may suffer from exhaustion of body fluids, leading to dryness of the epiglottis, and thus cannot speak; or it may be due to insufficient kidney qi, with virtual fire injuring the lungs, resulting in speech loss; or there may be convulsions and apoplexy causing mutism.

If one cannot speak, it is not due to locked jaws preventing sound. **Voiceless After Illness** Qian discusses a condition of kidney deficiency leading to a similar loss of voice. After vomiting and diarrhea, or after a serious illness, one may still make sounds but cannot speak, yet can swallow medicine. This is not a true loss of voice; it is due to kidney deficiency failing to connect with the yang. Therefore, the Kidney Nourishing Pills are indicated. A true loss of voice arises from a sudden illness. **Epilepsy and Voicelessness** Chao states in \"Sources of Illness\": If a child has epilepsy and becomes voiceless after six or seven years old, it is a sign of wind epilepsy. At this time, the mouth and eyes may be affected, with symptoms like eye rolling or spasms in the hands and feet, rigid back, or bent neck, all resulting from a child catching a chill due to improper dressing while breastfeeding. If one's voice is lost after an epilepsy episode, it is due to wind. Excessive sweating from heavy clothing and overexposure to wind leads to this condition.

His pulse was strong yet faint; using one tael of ginseng and decocting it with ginger and jujube brought some relief, and after three doses, he was cured. Additionally, due to fatigue and mental strain, he experienced spontaneous sweating, thirst, and restlessness, resembling epilepsy. First, I used two doses of Danggui Blood Supplement Decoction for immediate relief, followed by Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, and he soon recovered. A seven-year-old child collapsed from fear at the sound of thunder, being unaware of his surroundings, indicating weakness due to fear.
