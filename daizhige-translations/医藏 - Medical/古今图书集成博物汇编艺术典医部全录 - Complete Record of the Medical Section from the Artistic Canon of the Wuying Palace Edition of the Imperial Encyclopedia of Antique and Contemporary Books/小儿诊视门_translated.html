<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Spiritual Pivot Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Diagnosing Diseases with the Pulse</strong></p>
<p>If an infant&#39;s hair stands upright, it is certain to die.<br><em>Note: This discusses the essence of human blood and qi, which originates from prenatal formation and circulates universally. An infant is a newborn. Hair is a surplus of blood, produced from the lesser yin essence. Hair that droops responds to blood and qi rising from below and descending from above. If hair stands upright, it means only rising and no descending occurs. The interplay of rising and falling ceases, hence death is inevitable.</em><br>If the blue vein appears between the ears, it signifies pulling pain. <em>(<em>In the &quot;Jia Yi Classic,&quot; this is described as abdominal pain.</em>)</em><br><em>Note: The kidneys govern the bones and open to the ears, thus the appearance of the blue vein between the ears indicates pain related to the tendons and bones. This is connected to the previous discussion regarding the blood and qi originating from the kidneys.</em><br>Stools that are red indicate a condition. <em>(<em>In the &quot;Jia Yi Classic,&quot; this is referred to as blue stools.</em>)</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>If the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, it is difficult to resolve. If the pulse is weak but the hands and feet are warm, it is easy to resolve. </p>
<p>Note: &quot;Bian&quot; means to differentiate. The term &quot;red and differentiated stool&quot; refers to a separation between yellow and red. This is because the middle jiao processes the turbid residues and transforms the essence into blood, circulating in the meridians, termed as nutrient qi. Food and drink normally reside together in the stomach, forming residue that descends into the large intestine, where it mixes with transformed fluid and seeps into the bladder. If the stool is red and differentiated, it implies that the blood in the middle jiao is being expelled along with the residue. When there is diarrhea, the large intestine is deficient and cannot properly transform. In this case, the gastrointestinal system fails to nourish the pulse with its essence, hence the weak pulse. However, when the hands and feet are warm, it indicates that the lower jiao has vitality, making it easier to resolve. This indicates that the essence of food and drink in the middle jiao relies on the vitality of the lower jiao for transformation.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Xiang Er Jing&quot; (The Examination of Children) by Yan Zhu of the Jin Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Longevity and Mortality</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, if their cries are long and continuous, it indicates a long life. If the cries cease and then suddenly become urgent, it suggests a short life. If the cries are scattered, it indicates that they will not reach adulthood. If the cries are deep, it also suggests they will not reach adulthood. If the umbilical cord has no blood, it is favorable. A small umbilical cord indicates a short life. If the body is soft and weak as if it has no bones, it suggests a short life. A bright and robust appearance indicates longevity. If the eyes open by themselves, it suggests they will not reach adulthood. If the eyes do not align correctly and move excessively, it is unfavorable. Sweating blood indicates many troubles and a short life. If there is no sweat, it suggests they will not reach adulthood. If urine is thick like fatty grease, it suggests they will not reach adulthood. If there are four fractures in the head, it indicates they will not reach adulthood. If the child constantly shakes their hands and feet, it indicates they will not reach adulthood. Early sitting, early walking, early teeth, and early speech are all signs of poor fate, not of a good person. If the hair on the head does not cover the scalp evenly, the child is unlikely to reach adulthood. Sparse hair indicates they will not be able to listen to others. If there is a swirl of hair on the forehead, it will bring early misfortune to the parents. If the occipital bone does not form properly, they may speak but will die. If the coccyx does not form properly, they may sit but will die. If the bones of the palm do not form properly, they may crawl but will die. If the heel bone does not form properly, they may walk but will die. If the kneecap does not form properly, they may stand but will die. If the body does not gather properly, they will die. If they have a fish-shaped mouth, they will die. If there is no living flesh between the thighs, they will die. If the jaw is broken, they will die. If the genitalia do not appear, they will die. If the scrotum is white underneath, they will die; if it is red, they will die. If the sutures of the skull are open and dark, it indicates longevity.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong><br><strong>(Jin Dynasty - Wang Shuhe)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Song on the Life and Death of Infants</strong></p>
<p>After nursing, if an infant vomits, and the pulse is chaotic with no worries,<br>(Note: Changes in digestion and unregulated breathing, along with vomiting and a chaotic pulse, are not considered a disease.)<br>When the pulse is tight and quick, it is affected by internal wind,<br>When the pulse is slow, it indicates undigested milk.<br>(Note: A tight and quick pulse in infants indicates wind and cold obstruction, leading to spleen disorders and undigested milk.)<br>A tight, rapid, thin pulse may indicate some bitterness and is accompanied by vacuity and stagnant evil energy that can cause fright.<br>(Note: A rapid and thin pulse is the normal state for infants; if it is also tight, there may be some external disturbance. A pulse that is vacuous and moist indicates the presence of evil energy causing fright.)<br>In cases of dysentery with urgent pain in the intestines, a floating, strong pulse indicates the path back to the source.<br>(Note: A floating and strong pulse is inappropriate for dysentery.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p>
<h3>Song of the Fifteen External Signs</h3>
<p>Red veins above the eyes, descending into the pupils.<br><em>Note: The Chi family says: the red veins relate to the heart, and the pupils to the kidneys; this indicates that the heart fire overpowers the kidney water. When water is depleted, it cannot nourish wood, leading to the kidneys and liver being exhausted. The &quot;Entry&quot; states: water and fire are obstructed and exhausted.</em></p>
<p>Swelling at the temples, forming pits as well.<br><em>Note: When heat prevails, there is swelling; when heat is extreme, there are depressions. All are signs of heat. The &quot;Entry&quot; states: the heart is exhausted.</em></p>
<p>Nose dry and blackened.<br><em>Note: Fire overcomes metal. The &quot;Entry&quot; states: the lungs are exhausted.</em></p>
<p>Abdomen large with blue veins.<br><em>Note: Wood overcomes earth. The &quot;Entry&quot; states: the spleen is exhausted and lacks nourishment.</em></p>
<p>Eyes continuously staring, unable to blink.<br><em>Note: The classics say: to return yet not blink is this. The &quot;Entry&quot; states: if the eyes gaze straight, then all five organs are exhausted.</em></p>
<p>Fingernails are dark and blue, suddenly making crow sounds.<br><em>Note: The lungs and liver are exhausted. The &quot;Entry&quot; states: dark blue fingernails indicate liver exhaustion; crow sounds mean there is energy going out but none coming in, indicating that the pulse is exhausted.</em></p>
<p>The tongue extends out, biting the teeth.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>【Note: When the heart&#39;s vitality is extinguished. &quot;Entering the Path&quot; states: When the tongue relaxes, heart energy is lost; when the kidneys are bitten, the energy is lost.】 The fish gasps for breath, but does not make a sound.<br>【Note: The open mouth of the fish that does not close is called the spleen&#39;s energy exhausted. Gasping for breath and crying silently is called the lung&#39;s energy exhausted.】 When the roundworm emerges, it is surely a sign of impending death.<br>【Note: The roundworm lives in the stomach, nourished by grain. When the stomach is expended and no grain enters, the worm emerges.】 Quick medical intervention can save one in ten.<br>【Note: Summarizing the previous fifteen conditions. Among children with this condition, only one in ten can be treated.】<br>A Thousand Gold Prescriptions by Sun Simiao, Tang Dynasty  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Children</strong></p>
<p>For children above three years old and under one, observe their temperament to understand their potential for lifespan. Children who are perceptive and quick to understand often die young. Those who resemble the likes of Xiang Qiao and Yan Hui are examples. If a child&#39;s bones are well-formed and they exhibit grace and ease, requiring little effort for refinement, they tend to live long. Those who are quick-witted and agile in understanding others are also prone to early death, similar to figures like Yang Xiu and Kong Rong. From this perspective, one can glean insights about longevity. It is akin to plum blossoms blooming early, unaware of the winter&#39;s harshness; sweet chrysanthemums bloom late, ultimately achieving longevity. Therefore, delayed development suggests a sign of longevity.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Pediatric Pulse Diagnosis</strong> </p>
<p><strong>By Qian Yi of the Song Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pulse Methods</strong></p>
<p>A tight and rapid pulse indicates disharmony of qi; a deep and slow pulse indicates food stagnation; a hurried and knotty pulse indicates a state of fright; a floating pulse indicates wind, while a deep and fine pulse indicates cold; a chaotic pulse cannot be treated. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pulse reflects the body&#39;s constitution and is a precursor to pathological changes; it serves as a guideline for medication, thus it is essential to understand it clearly. The &quot;Complete Guide to Pediatric Care&quot; states that for children under one year old, one should check the three pulse positions at the tiger&#39;s mouth (the index finger) to assess illness. If the pulse from the Yin (the first position) reaches only to the Mao (the second position), it is easy to treat; if it connects to the Mao, it is difficult to treat; and if the Yin encroaches on the Mao or the Mao extends beyond the Chen (the third position), the chances of recovery are slim. If the pulse shows five colors, such as blue due to fright or purple due to diarrhea, one should categorize these accordingly. After one year of age, one can use a single finger to assess its three parts: the rapid, floating, and sinking pulses. By four to five years old, a pulse rate of seven or eight and fine is normal; nine signifies harm, and ten indicates exhaustion.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The sixth and fifth positions are associated with emptiness and cold; a tight pulse indicates wind stroke, while a rapid pulse signifies external obstruction. If the pulse changes to a steaming quality, it must be disordered. If there is heat between the bones, the pulse will be deep and rapid. A floating pulse that is not harmonious indicates an insidious condition; a large and rapid floating pulse suggests wind-heat; a hidden knot indicates the accumulation of matter; a fine and subtle pulse points to consumption or abdominal pain; a floating and strong pulse suggests the presence of worms; a floating and slow pulse indicates stomach cold. This is the essential discussion of pulse diagnosis. However, for children, since their vital energy is not yet solidified, fright causes their energy to scatter, leading to a disordered pulse. Furthermore, one should also refer to the three positions and five pulses. The three positions involve examining the facial complexion, the pulse at the tiger&#39;s mouth, and the inch pulse. The five pulses include pressing on the forehead and diagnosing at Tai Chong, along with the three prior positions, collectively referred to as the five pulses. Although the treatment methods differentiate between deficiency and excess, actual conditions of excess are accompanied by strong disease energy and weak physical vitality, whereas deficiencies indicate both weak physical vitality and disease energy. The text states: &quot;If the true qi is depleted, it leads to deficiency; if the evil qi prevails, it results in excess.&quot; It also states: &quot;For deficiencies, replenish the root; for excesses, drain the branch.&quot; Master Dong Yuan states: &quot;If the physical condition is full, it should be drained; if the physical condition is empty, it should be supplemented.&quot;<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>Facial Diagnosis</p>
<p>The left cheek corresponds to the liver, the right cheek to the lungs, the forehead to the heart, the nose to the spleen, and the chin to the kidneys. If the color is red, it indicates heat, and treatment should follow the symptoms. </p>
<p>(Note: The left cheek corresponds to the liver; a blue color indicates proper function, while white indicates improper function. If the color is red, it denotes liver channel wind-heat, with symptoms of heat and discomfort. A dark blue-black color indicates convulsions and abdominal pain, while pale red indicates tidal fever and phlegm cough. The right cheek corresponds to the lungs; a white color indicates proper function, while red indicates improper function. If the redness is severe, it indicates cough, difficulty breathing, and chaos. Drinking water that reaches the kidneys can result in red and urgent urination or obstruction. The forehead corresponds to the heart; a red color indicates proper function, while black indicates improper function. A blue-black color indicates convulsions, abdominal pain, and crying; a light yellow indicates night sweats, dry hair, and bone heat. The nose corresponds to the spleen; a yellow color indicates proper function, while blue indicates improper function. A red color indicates spleen channel deficiency heat, with reduced appetite; deep yellow indicates constipation and a dry nose with nosebleeds. The chin corresponds to the kidneys; a black color indicates proper function, while yellow indicates improper function. A red color indicates heat in the kidneys and bladder, leading to obstruction of urination.)<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p>
<h3>Eye Diagnosis</h3>
<p>If the inner eye is red, it indicates excess heat in the heart; use Daohong San. If it is light red, it indicates a deficiency of heat in the heart; use Shengxi San. If it is blue, it indicates excess heat in the liver; use Xieqing Wan. If it is light blue, it indicates a deficiency of heat in the liver; use Dihuang Wan. If it is yellow, it indicates excess heat in the spleen; use Xiehuang San. If it is slightly yellow, it indicates a deficiency of heat in the spleen; use Yihuang San. If the eye lacks brightness, it indicates kidney deficiency; use Dihuang Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The eye is the essence of the five organs, each associated with a specific color. The white part of the eye belongs to the lungs, the black part belongs to the liver, the upper and lower eyelids belong to the spleen, the red vessels belong to the heart, and the pupil belongs to the kidneys. These colors reflect the primary conditions of the five organs. However, if the white part of the eye is red, it indicates the heart invading the lungs; if it is blue, it indicates the liver overacting; if it is black, it indicates the kidneys overpowering the lungs; if it is yellow, it indicates the spleen overpowering the lungs. The same goes for the other observations.</p>
<h3>Death Diagnosis</h3>
<p>There is irregular diarrhea, and the spirit seems fine. There is insatiable thirst, relieving it only to feel thirsty again. There is nasal discharge without sneezing. In severe illness, the mouth is dry and the patient cannot sleep. Signs include bluish-black spots on the lips, cheeks deeply red as if painted with rouge, flaring nostrils, and irregular, labored breathing. The face displays five colors, lacking clarity and luster.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Book of Living People: Discussions on Pediatric Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Hong, Song Dynasty</strong></p>
<p>Although the treatment methods for children and adults are generally the same, the dosages for children should be smaller, as their body heat is often lower. For ordinary colds with fever, runny nose, phlegm, cough, and thirst, use Xingsing San. If there is difficulty swallowing, with phlegm and a productive cough, use Shuzhangzi Decoction. If the head and body are warm, with yellowish stools and abdominal heat, use Sijun San, Lianqiao Drink, or Sanhuang Pills. If the head and body are warm, with white and foul-smelling stools, this indicates food stagnation in the stomach; use Shuangwan Pills. If the child has no other diseases but overindulges in food, leading to abdominal distention, fever, and headache, Shuangwan Pills can treat this. When a child has a warm body, painful head, restless spirit, red urine, and constipation, this is a severe heat condition; use Xinxin San or Tiaowei Chengqi Decoction. For headaches with fever and a fear of cold, this indicates a cold injury; use Shengma Decoction. If there&#39;s no sweating, use Mahuang Huangqing Decoction; if sweating occurs, use Shengma Huangqin Decoction—both are essential medicines. </p>
<p>Children should not take excessive cooling medicines, as cold stomachs can provoke worms, leading to symptoms resembling fright. Doctors often misinterpret these conditions and mistakenly administer fright medicines, like Musk, which may lead to vomiting and chronic fright due to a weakened stomach. Children must exhibit clear signs of heat before any dispersing treatments are considered, and great caution should be taken with purgative pills. Instead, use ingredients like Dahuang and Chuanxiong to make decoctions that can help expel the accumulated heat. In essence, the pills with Ba Dou just serve to treat food stagnation.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>

<p>For a child&#39;s pulse, press on the three sections with the thumb. A count of six to seven beats per breath is considered balanced and harmonious; eight to nine indicates fever, while five suggests internal cold. A tense pulse suggests wind-induced convulsions, a deep and slow pulse indicates food stagnation, a rapid pulse signifies fright, and a tense and rapid pulse means discord in Qi. A deep and fine pulse is indicative of cold, while a floating pulse points to wind. An uneven pulse in size suggests adverse signs and malefic spirits, while a floating and large pulse indicates wind or heat hidden causing accumulations, and a fine single pulse suggests malnutrition. If there is abdominal pain accompanied by a lot of wheezing and vomiting with a strong pulse, it suggests the presence of worms. A deep and slow pulse with an intermittent fever indicates stomach cold; warming it will bring relief. </p>
<p>The rule states: a child’s pulse is tight in cases of wind convulsions; a deep and slow pulse with food stagnation leads to frequent vomiting. A tense and rapid pulse indicates discord in Qi, while a fast pulse suggests fright preventing spirit from settling. A cold pulse is deep and fine, while a wind pulse is floating. Firm stools that are difficult or prolonged indicate issues. If abdominal pain leads to tight and tense pulses, chaotic pulses are a sign that treatment may be futile. During the time of transformation, the pulse must be chaotic; without treatment, false diagnoses may follow. A single fine pulse with signs of malnutrition indicates the presence of worms, and an uneven pulse size signifies adverse signs. A slow and deep pulse with intermittent fever indicates an internal invasion of stomach cold. Excessive diarrhea with a strong pulse is difficult to treat; careful consideration and examination are necessary.</p>
<p>Master Yunqi states: Before the age of five, it is unwise to evaluate pulse characteristics, as differentiation is not possible. Only after five years can the distinctions of floating and sinking, fast and slow, be made. According to Qian&#39;s writings, the age limit is not strictly bound to five years.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Children</strong></p>
<p>From the &quot;Suwen&quot;: When the body is hot and dislikes cold, shivering and anxiety ensue, these are signs of a heat condition, belonging to the Shaoyin&#39;s fire. If there are severe and straightened limbs with internal urgency and muscle spasms, these are wind conditions, belonging to the Jueyin&#39;s wind wood. Children are defined as those above six years of age, and those above eighteen years as youth. Those below six years are not covered by the various channels, which is why infants are difficult to treat when ill, and their conditions cannot be determined. However, children and adults cannot be treated the same way; they require different treatments. Although children are fragile and soft in their bones and flesh after being swaddled, their intestines and stomach are delicate; they can digest milk and food, which helps balance their internal organs, allowing them to remain healthy. Their skin is moist and their muscles and bones are tender, thus when dressed in soft clothing, any blockage may occur, leading to internal heat accumulation. This heat can harm the heart, causing it to suffer from evil heat, resulting in fright. If fright persists, it may turn into convulsions. Generally, illnesses in children are characterized by pure Yang, with an excess of heat and a deficiency of cold.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Pediatric Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>Children suffering from food accumulation, phlegm, and heat, often have issues related to milk. Generally, liver and spleen disorders are prevalent. Children are commonly afflicted with liver issues, where the liver is often excessive and the kidneys are deficient.</p>
<p><strong>Observation of Form and Color</strong></p>
<p>The forehead is associated with heart fire, the left cheek with liver wood, the right cheek with lung metal, the nose with spleen earth, and the chin with kidney water. The color purple indicates excessive heat, red signifies exterior pathogenic heat, green suggests fright, white indicates parasites, dark greenish-black points to abdominal pain, white suggests malnutrition, yellow signifies spleen deficiency, yellowish-white with blue lips indicates malaria, yellow suggests food accumulation, dark purple indicates pestilence, and bluish-white suggests liver issues. </p>
<p>When observing children’s form and color, bluish veins indicate spleen heat generating wind. Red and hot cheeks exhibit conflict, while yellow indicates spleen deficiency. Dark gas with abdominal pain indicates pestilence, and white signifies malnutrition causing weight loss. If encountering dark rings around both eyes, it is as if experiencing a dream. </p>
<p>To recognize children&#39;s symptoms, one must assess their appearance. Yellow skin with thin muscles suggests retention of masses; blue lips and a pale face indicate pain. A dry tongue and scorched lips signal internal heat, while drowsiness with dim vision suggests depleted spleen energy. Clenching hands and pulling feet indicate fright, and malnutrition produces a distended belly. </p>
<p>Mucus at the corners of the eyes signifies liver heat, while saliva at the mouth indicates spleen cold. Sparse, upright hair indicates blood deficiency, and bubbling edema suggests dampness related to the spleen.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>Nostrils blackened and charred indicate lung heat, dry ears signify kidney transmission. Elevated chest and short of breath reflect lung inflammation, heat causing the fontanel to swell and sink.</p>
<p>The child’s spirit suddenly diminishes, their facial skin turns yellowish white and inconsistent. It is likely that dairy and food within cause harm, chilled and greasy foods obstruct the body. Symptoms may lead to bowel sounds and diarrhea, or potentially malaria manifesting. Suddenly swollen, gradually emaciated, signs of phlegm, parasitic ailments, and four symptoms emerge.</p>
<p>The child&#39;s skin turns red, cheeks appearing as if painted with vermilion. How about the effects of wind and cold? The tidal heat comes and goes without notice. It may resemble convulsions requiring treatment, or toxins being expelled. The mouth feels dry, crying with tears like pearls, sleep is sluggish, refusing to nurse.</p>
<p>Childhood illnesses take various forms, ultimately reliant on visual assessment. Huddled in arms, timid of the cool wind, feeling warm and feverish during sleep. Night crying with fever leads to abdominal pain, gazing straight, convulsions need caution. Long sighs and short breaths hide heat within, phlegm and wheezing surge upward, fire is strong.</p>
<p>It is essential to identify signs of a child&#39;s passing; the fontanel sinks, forming a pit. In the throat, gas and phlegm tug and saw, eyes closed, spirit absent. Lips and gums turn pale white, hands and feet feel icy cold. The crow calls, mouth tight, eyes often rolling, refusing to nurse, and experiencing urinary incontinence, resulting in chaos.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>For children over one year old, the pulse can be examined. Six beats per breath indicate a balanced state; seven or eight beats suggest excess heat, while one to four beats indicate a slow and weak state. Normally, a child&#39;s pulse should have six beats per breath in a balanced manner. Seven to eight beats are often associated with excessive heat, while three to four beats indicate a deficiency of cold diseases. If there are nine or ten quick beats, it resembles the pecking of a sparrow, and one or two movements of the fingers indicate an illness. A slightly cold, tight, and rapid pulse is unmistakably accurate, and the treatment should be clear between tonifying and purging.</p>
<p>When there is body heat, a floating pulse may indicate the need for sweating; if the body is cold, a fine pulse suggests rest without aggressive treatment. Asthma and cough with a tight and rapid pulse show that medication may be ineffective, while swelling and a fine pulse may indicate pain. For diarrhea that is deep and slow, recovery is uncertain, and for measles with many rapid pulses, treatment is urgent. If there are vomiting and epistaxis (nosebleed) with a fear of floating and surging pulses, and abdominal pain that is deep and subtle, careful inspection is essential.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p>
<h3>On Treatment Methods</h3>
<p>If the lower legs feel hot, both cheeks are red, there is persistent thirst, the face is flushed, limbs are tossed about, bowel movements are obstructed, urine is yellow, the body is strong and feverish with no signs of retreat, all of these should be treated with cooling remedies. Hot and tonifying medications should not be used. </p>
<p>Young children should not be given hot medications, with cheeks resembling ripe peaches. Their hands and feet feel hot and fiery; the pulses are floating and chaotic, urine is red and concentrated, bowel movements are stubbornly constipated. They may lift their clothing to drink water, enjoy being in the wind, have persistent thirst, and experience nosebleeds.</p>
<p>If the lower legs feel cold, the face appears pale, the breath fluctuates between hot and cold, the body often leans against others, the eyes are blue, there is persistent vomiting and diarrhea, and abdominal pain occurs, all of these should be treated with warming tonics. Cooling and purging medications should not be used.</p>
<p>Young children should not be given cooling medications; their complexion appears pale and listless. The limbs are cold as ice, and the pulses are faint and hidden. They have difficulty digesting milk, often vomit, and their stools resemble duck droppings, occurring frequently. They show signs of weakness, abdominal pain, blue eyes, and prolonged illness may lead to complications.</p>
<p>For children under one year of age with illness, it is often due to fetal toxins, and it is urgent to detoxify. For those over two years old with illness, it is mostly due to food accumulation, and treatment should aim to alleviate this and tonify the spleen. Other methods are scattered throughout various sections and will not be detailed here.</p>
<p>If there is an exterior affliction from wind-cold, a dispersing powder can be used. For internal injuries from milk and food causing discomfort, harmonizing and digestive remedies should be administered concurrently. For coughs, the group of herbs known as &quot;Shen Su&quot; can be brewed, and for vomiting and diarrhea, the rectifying formula is the most effective. For shocks causing spasms, “Guangxin” should be used, and the red and green detoxifying methods should not be mixed.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Excess and Insufficiency of Prenatal Qi in Knowing Life and Death</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, if there is a rupture in the body, it will surely die. If the scrotum is white, it will surely die. If the genitals do not descend, it will die. If there is no flesh in the abdomen, it will surely die. If the cry resembles that of a crow, it will surely die. At the age of one, if the skull bones are opening, teeth and hair have not emerged, limbs are contracted, knees appear like crane joints, and the body is weak and cannot stand, this indicates insufficiency of prenatal Qi, leading to early death. If the muscles are strong, then there is much strength; if the bones are solid, then there is early movement; if the blood is abundant, the body is thin with much hair; if the flesh is sufficient, there are few diseases; if the essence is rich, the child is clever and often laughs and speaks, unafraid of cold or heat; if the Qi is sufficient, there is little hair and a plump body – these all indicate an abundance of prenatal Qi, leading to longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Examine the Cold and Heat of the Hands</strong></p>
<p>The tips of the five fingers being cold signifies an inability to withstand shock. If the middle finger is hot, it surely indicates a febrile illness. If the middle finger is cold on its own, it is a sign of smallpox. Boys have their left hand and girls their right; this should be observed carefully. </p>
<p><strong>Examination of the Three Passages and Hand Tendons in Children</strong><a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>Infants aged one month to three years, if they have ailments, must check the pulse at the tiger&#39;s mouth, then the index finger&#39;s first segment represents the life gate, the second the qi gate, and the third the wind gate. According to ancient texts, if one first contracts a wind gate illness, it is still treatable; however, once it reaches the qi gate, it is certainly difficult to cure.</p>
<p>When diagnosing hand channels and colors:</p>
<p>For males, observe the left index finger; for females, observe the right index finger. The first segment of the wind gate is easy to treat, the second segment of the qi gate indicates deeper illness, and the third segment of the life gate suggests death. If the three gates are blue, it indicates shock to the limbs. If they are black, it indicates water-related shock. If they are purple or white, it suggests someone carries shock. Red indicates fear from a dog. Such pulse conditions at the three gates are very serious and signal certain death; other ailments may still be treatable.</p>
<p>The wind gate appearing blue like a fish spine is easy to treat; this is initial shock. If it is black, it becomes difficult to treat. The qi gate appearing blue like a fish spine signifies consumption and fever; it is easy to treat with a life-preserving formula added with Chai Hu and Huang Qin. The life gate appearing blue like a fish spine indicates weakness and wind evasion affecting the spleen, which is difficult to treat using a golden tablet with Bai Zhu and Fu Ling.</p>
<p>If the wind gate appears dark blue like a suspended needle, it indicates water shock. If this occurs at the qi gate, it indicates consumption with accumulated heat in the lungs; it should be treated with a life-preserving formula added with lantern heart and bamboo leaves. If the life gate shows five colors, they are all signs of death that cannot be treated.</p>
<p>If the wind gate appears like the word for water, it indicates phlegm in the diaphragm and stagnation; the treatment should focus on descending. At the qi gate, it indicates shock entering the lungs, causing coughing and a red face; treat with a life-preserving formula. At the life gate, it suggests severe shock accompanied by wind and consumption; use aloe pills. If bypassing the three gates occurs, then treatment should cease.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The wind passage resembles the shape of the letter &quot;乙,&quot; which is associated with liver shock and is easy to treat. In the air passage, it indicates sudden shock, while in the life passage, the dark blue or black indicates chronic spleen wind, which is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>The wind passage looks like a curved bug, signifying accumulation of malnutrition disease, with the chest resembling a row of counting beads and the abdomen resembling an inflated pig bladder. In the air passage, it signifies accumulation of filth in the large intestine. In the life passage, it relates to the heart influencing the liver and is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>The wind passage resembles a ring, indicating hot accumulation in the liver related to malnutrition; in the air passage, it signifies malnutrition entering the stomach, leading to unresolvable vomiting; in the life passage, the malnutrition is challenging to treat.</p>
<p>If there are irregular patterns, limited to the wind and air passages, treatment is still possible. However, if the life passage is affected, treatment becomes difficult.</p>
<p>If there are rashes, either blue or black, occurring on the hands, feet, face, or on either side of the face, it is fatal. </p>
<p>If the pulse patterns curve inward, it indicates air malnutrition. Those affected experience tightness in the abdomen and should be treated with purging. </p>
<p>If the pulse patterns curve outward, it suggests wind malnutrition. Those affected should be treated urgently for shock. </p>
<p>If the pulse patterns slant to the right, it indicates fever due to typhus with no appetite and no sweating; treatment should involve &quot;Awakening the Consciousness&quot; powder. </p>
<p>If the pulse patterns slant to the left, it suggests fever from a common cold accompanied by loss of appetite and sweating.</p>
<p>A double hook pulse indicates typhus.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>There are three types of pulses resembling long worms; these indicate injury to hard substances.<br>There are pulses with two curves like hooks; these indicate injury to cold substances.<br>There is a pulse with one end like a ring, and also one with a single foot; these too indicate injury to cold.<br>If there are four or five dots connected on the face, this is certainly a sign of recurrence.<br>On the skin of the head or abdomen, if there are wavy lines resembling the character &quot;you&quot; stacked above and below, along with prominent veins, this indicates the presence of toxic food and accumulated shock, which is difficult to treat.<br>Another pulse looks like chaotic worms; this represents malnutrition, as well as parasitic infestations, food accumulation, which can be treated successfully.

<p><strong>A Song to Distinguish the Colors of Children’s Pulses</strong></p>

<p>A cold nose indicates pain; some say it is a rash. A cold ear results from wind-heat conditions. Pulling at the clothing and a warm belly suggest a cold injury; upper heat and lower cold indicate food-related illness.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis Overview</strong></p>
<p>Shaking the head and rubbing the eyes, liver heat produces wind. Rubbing the eyes with tears suggests heat in the three burners. A runny nose indicates lung cold. Red cheeks and a yellow face indicate wind injuring lung heat. Cholera with vomiting suggests gastric gas injury. Irregular diarrhea indicates gas attacking the intestines. A blue face and frequent yawning signal wind transferring to the liver. Frequent night sweats show internal heat. Cold injury manifests in chills and spasms. Stomach heat causes rashes and injury from cold. Long sighs and grinding teeth signal excessive wind and energy. Lifting the head and shaking indicates a full chest and stomach. Lung congestion harms and results in coughing up blood. Excessive saliva brings wheezing; accumulated heat from wind causes injuries. Painful urination indicates heat accumulating in the bladder. Hernia due to crying signifies internal blockages in the fetus. Milk bumps and spleen lumps arise from external injuries. A sore throat suggests lung heat. Craving dirt indicates spleen lesions. Vomiting phlegm suggests ascendant roundworms. Rectal bleeding indicates injuries from heat and cold. Thirst and mouth sores show heart heat. A yellow face and edema indicate gas uprising. Issues with legs and neck stiffness arise from internal heat. Speech issues and slowed movements signal accumulation harming the fetus. Stiff neck and liver wind arise from energy harming the tongue. Essential medical texts elaborate on disease origins.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>Listening to Sounds to Know Illnesses</p>
<p>A sad voice indicates liver illness, a joyful voice indicates heart illness, a slow voice indicates spleen illness, a calling voice indicates lung illness, a heavy voice indicates arm illness, a clear voice indicates gallbladder illness, a short voice indicates small intestine illness, a rapid voice indicates stomach illness, a long voice indicates large intestine illness, a faint voice indicates bladder illness. A sad and slow voice indicates a conflict between liver and spleen diseases, a rapid and faint voice indicates a conflict between stomach and bladder diseases. A thin and broken voice signifies fullness, a light voice signifies deficiency, a heavy and coarse voice signifies wind, a short and thin voice signifies qi, a coarse voice signifies heat, a short and slow voice signifies diarrhea, and a long tied voice signifies dysentery. A full voice indicates blockage.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Life and Death</strong></p>
<p>When a child suffers from wind-heat, with wheezing and shoulder breaths, a slow pulse indicates life, while a rapid pulse indicates death. In cases of diarrhea, if the pulse is floating and large accompanied by abdominal pain, death is certain. In cases of breastfeeding illness, a small and hanging pulse with warm hands and feet indicates life, while coldness indicates death. If a child is bedridden, sweating like pearls but not flowing, that child will die.</p>
<p>If a child is ill with a sunken chest, dry lips, eyes fixated, cold breath, a lowered head, unable to rise, with limp hands and feet, rigid body, and cold palms, such cases are untreatable. The same applies to those with a disordered pulse. If the eyes roll upwards, this is called &quot;heavenly suspension,&quot; and it should be treated with &quot;Yongquan&quot; (a specific point), extinguishing flames. For those unaware of human affairs, moxibustion is advised. If the nails are red, treatment is possible. For heaviness, use &quot;Tongguan San,&quot; blowing it into the nostrils, and treat with &quot;Duanming Dan.&quot; If the child does not awaken after something enters the nose, do not attempt treatment. </p>
<p>If the entire body is red, this indicates a lung disorder, and if there is heat in the spleen channel, there is no need for medication. For children with dark rashes on the face and hands, swollen palms without patterns, dark in the &quot;Kan&quot; area, a flat and full &quot;Ren&quot; area, and foul-smelling stools, along with an inverted head, this child will surely die. </p>
<p>In summary, when examining a child, if they suckle tightly, treatment is easier; if they suckle loosely, treatment becomes more difficult.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p>
<h3>General Song</h3>
<p>In pediatrics, there are special methods, but in urgent times, it’s hard to know which to use. Sudden wind, fever, and cough with phlegm should not be neglected when taking life-preserving pills. For acute and chronic shocks, the purple gold pill is essential before the rashes appear. For vomiting and diarrhea with abdominal pain, aiding the stomach is advised; sores in the lips and mouth need to neutralize the toxins. For tidal fever, use the Xin Xin powder; for vomiting, excessive use of needles and pills is necessary. Various types of malnutrition can all use aloe, preventing the need for difficult inquiries and painful searches.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Pediatrics</h3>
<p>In the medical path, treating conditions according to the major pulse is particularly challenging, and pediatric cases are even more difficult. This is because children’s organs are delicate, their skin and bones tender, their blood and qi are not robust, their meridians are like threads, and their pulses fine as hairs. They easily fluctuate between deficiency and excess, cold and heat. Furthermore, they cannot speak, point with their hands, or indicate where they are in pain. Thus, it is rare for someone to accurately diagnose their conditions without examining their form and color, listening to sounds, and feeling the pulse to identify the source of the illness and understand their yin and yang, inner and outer, deficiency and excess.</p>
<h3>Tiger Mouth Pulse</h3>
<p>The first section: red stripes indicate shock from birds or external people. A gentle red stripe signals fire shock; black stripes indicate water shock; green stripes represent thunder or four-foot shock; slightly curled hidden green stripes denote urgent wind conditions. The second section: purple stripes indicate shock from malnutrition, blue stripes denote liver malnutrition, white stripes indicate lung malnutrition, yellow stripes represent spleen malnutrition, and black stripes are difficult to treat. The third section: blue-black stripes at the three joints mean passage is blocked, and if they lean towards the nails, it indicates untreatable conditions.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable Effects of Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Fang Xian)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Observing the Three Sections and Five Pulses of Children</strong>  </p>
<p>Mr. Shui Jian said: Although children are shaped by the dual forces of yin and yang, their energy is not yet complete, so how can one speak of pulses? Only when the transformation and steaming are completed and the energies of yin and yang are sufficient, can one observe the pulse. At the age of childhood, the formation of yin and yang begins. It is said that a boy is called &quot;tiao&quot; at the age of seven, when his original yang energy emerges; a girl is called &quot;chen&quot; at eight, when her yin and yang are fully formed. Therefore, before reaching the ages of tiao and chen, they are referred to as pure yang. After surpassing the tiao and chen ages, they are called children, and only then can the pulse be observed. </p>
<p>For a child from birth to half a year old, if there is illness, one should quickly examine the forehead, above the brows, and at the hairline, using the ring finger, middle finger, and index finger to gently press. If all three fingers are hot, it indicates a cold condition resulting in nasal congestion and coarse breathing; if all three fingers are cold, it suggests vomiting and diarrhea. If the index finger is hot, the chest is narrow; if the ring finger is hot, there is disharmony with milk and food, leading to illness. After six months, one can begin to observe the pulse at the tiger mouth area. After one year, observe both the tiger mouth and the pulse of one finger. If after five hundred sixty-four days, the steaming is sufficient, only one finger pulse should be observed by pressing with the index finger, rolling it up and down, and dividing into three sections. The term &quot;three sections&quot; here does not refer to cun, guan, and chi. For children, the three sections are: looking at the facial color as one section, the pulse patterns at the tiger mouth as the second section, and the single finger pulse as the third section. The five pulses include pressing on the forehead above and on Tai Chong below, thus combining the three sections to make five pulses. If a child is ill and shows no severe symptoms, it is not necessary to constantly examine the pulse at Tai Chong, as this pulse is crucial for determining life and death.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>In a person aged seven or eight, a pulse rate of six beats per breath is typical; eight indicates heat, nine indicates wind, five indicates deficiency, four indicates harm, three indicates collapse, two indicates death. A pulse rate of ten suggests illness and fatigue, resulting in a gaunt appearance. If the body is corpulent and pale, with a pulse rate of eleven or twelve, it is termed deficiency, indicating death from wind sickness and a disordered pulse. If the pulse rate is one or two beats per breath, it signifies an absence of pulse, and the person will likely experience cold and eventually die slowly. A pulse rate of eleven or twelve signifies a rapid pulse, with death likely occurring within three months. </p>
<p>What is one breath? One inhale and one exhale constitutes one breath. Breathing means the release of air and the intake of air, which is referred to as one breath. If the pulse feels hard and urgent, it indicates a blockage; if it is small, weak, and fine, it signifies cold; if light and weak, it indicates heat; if there is a sudden strong pulse, it suggests shock; if the pulse is uneven, it indicates a dire condition. Light and rapid pulses signify heat, while deep and firm pulses indicate cold; an uneven pulse suggests a bad prognosis. </p>
<p>Rapid pulses indicate tension; light pulses suggest a floating sensation; deep pulses feel firm under pressure; a blocked pulse indicates irregularity; heavy pulses sink deeply; and fine pulses are subtle. An uneven pulse, with variations in strength, signifies a lack of vital energy, and that person is bound to die. The previous scholars have thoroughly detailed the methods of the three divisions and five pulses, noted on the left. Future practitioners must not regard this lightly, as human life is at stake; they should diligently examine with sincere intent, with care and precision. Any mistakes could lead to grave consequences. A physician is responsible for life; must they not be cautious!<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p>
<h3>Differentiating the Three Pulses and Symptoms</h3>
<p>When the upper pulse is black, it indicates kidney issues. When the middle pulse is black as well, it suggests lingering symptoms. People are alarmed by this mixed condition, with the eyes often staring, suggesting phlegm accumulation. </p>
<p>When the lower pulse is black, it signals further alarm, but it’s essential to disperse wind and relieve accumulated heat in the intestines. Upper and lower pulses share the same cause of disturbance, as heat causes blockage and a lack of spirit.</p>
<p>When the upper pulse is green, it indicates wind in the liver, with straight gazes causing the face to appear greener. The middle pulse corresponds to alarm affecting all four limbs, leading to thirst, restlessness, and confusion. A lower green pulse signifies recurrent alarm roots; relieving heat and manifesting the intestines involves analysis.</p>
<p>If both upper and lower pulses are green, it is severe, with only one in ten remaining stable. A red upper pulse suggests excessive wind in the lungs, possibly leading to frequent fever and cough. The middle pulse indicates wind attacking the heart, resulting in abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea.</p>
<p>A lower red pulse reflecting severe shock denotes a need to regulate the heart using divine methods. When the upper and lower pulses are both difficult to treat, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, it indicates danger. </p>
<p>When the green liver pulse retains its form, closed eyes and body aches signify fragility. In the middle pulse, it points to watery diarrhea and recurring disturbance, with heat causing breathlessness and coughs without respite. </p>
<p>A lower green pulse might indicate alarm; efficient medicine can disperse wind and mitigate calamity. If both upper and lower pulses are green and generate heat, the limbs feel cold, signaling urgency.</p>
<p>When the upper pulse appears black, the eyes are wide, with loose stools possibly showing a green hue. When observed in the middle, signs reflect thirst; lower heat seems to yield yellow urine with stable bowels. </p>
<p>If the lower black pulse reveals accompanying red, frequent diarrhea ensues. Both upper and lower pulses must be evaluated through the extremities; if they feel empty and restless, thirst calls for prompt medical attention. </p>
<h3>Observing the Three Positions of the Pulse and the Five Colors<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></h3>
<p>When a red vein is seen at the upper pulse, it indicates a heart disease. It is feared that a purge could lead to deficiency, producing wind and phlegm; both should be treated with Zhenxin pills and Jingfeng powder. </p>
<p>If the middle pulse is red, it suggests excess wind heat, and one should administer cooling herbs to resolve this. </p>
<p>If the lower pulse is red, it may indicate fever and obstruction in the large intestine, which is a bad sign. </p>
<p>A black vein seen at the upper pulse indicates that the kidney pulse is in proper order. If there is obstruction in the large intestine causing wind symptoms, one should administer Zhu Sha ointment. </p>
<p>A black vein in the middle pulse suggests symptoms of wind but is not necessarily a bad sign; one should dispense Zhong Huang ointment. </p>
<p>If the lower pulse shows black without any worsening symptoms, one can treat with Xuan Zhuan pills, which will yield recovery. If there is diarrhea, this indicates cold in the intestines, and one should give warming decoctions for the internal organs without changing the treatment. </p>
<p>If a blue vein is observed at the upper pulse accompanied by reversed limbs and vomiting with added wheezing, it indicates a bad sign. If symptoms of vomiting and wheezing stabilize, it indicates recovery. </p>
<p>A blue vein in the middle pulse suggests wind attacking the heart, and it should be treated urgently with anti-wind remedies, such as Wu Xi and Zhu Sha ointment. </p>
<p>If a blue vein at the lower pulse shows no symptoms, it’s unnecessary to treat further. </p>
<p>Both the upper and middle pulses present similarly: warm limbs indicate harmony; reversed limbs indicate danger. </p>
<p>If a black vein and dark circles under the eyes are present, with a condition not yet reaching two years, this pulse indicates a presence of symptoms or excessive heat in the large intestine, leading to thirst. If there is no heat or thirst, one should treat with a resolving method. First, dispense Tianzhu yellow powder, then Zhu Sha ointment. </p>
<p>Disordered black veins indicate abdominal distention as a symptom, or if there is pain below, it suggests accumulation; one should use Xuan Feng pill powder followed by Yun Qi powder to harmonize the stomach qi. </p>

If sitting leads to vomiting, it is a bad omen; use harmonizing Qi powders to nourish deficiency. </p>
<p>If on the first day you see red pulse in the three regions, it signifies issues with the five organs. If on the second day the middle pulse is faint or hidden, and only the middle region is observable, it suggests a meteorological influence. </p>
<p>On the third day, if the three regions are either visible or slightly protruding, it indicates an essence-related condition. If consistently faint, without cycles, it may lead to death in several weeks. </p>
<p>If the upper part of the left hand has a red pulse returning to the inside, it signifies injury from accumulation, requiring the Tong Wan pills. If it curves to the outside, it indicates an attack by external winds, leading to convulsions; administer the Zhen Xin Wan powder. </p>
<p>If the middle pulse returns inward, it suggests external wind transforming; use regulating powders to resolve it. A curve outward represents a grave omen. </p>
<p>If the pulse exceeds the life gate and there are adverse signs outside, it is a bad omen. A chaotic red pulse in the upper region indicates issues from cold; use harmonizing Qi powders. </p>
<p>If the middle pulse is disordered, it suggests a wind-related heat transmission due to excessive wind; employ Wu Xi ointment to resolve it. </p>
<p>If the lower region is disordered, immediate warming of the spleen is necessary. If food intake is hindered, it is a bad sign. </p>
<p>If both sets of finger joints show mingled blue and red, resembling a purple tone without black, it is a grave omen. </p>
<p>If the upper region pulse is present, a cold illness is likely to cause a cough, requiring a slight release of the exterior. </p>
<p>If the pulse rises into the middle region, it indicates a wind condition; administer Qing Jin Gao.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>If one sees the lower gate, frequently retreating is auspicious; not retreating is a sign of misfortune.

<p>The two immortal figures, Sun and Hua, said: When a child&#39;s left hand pulses are observed in the right hand, it is a sign of inversion and evil. Conversely, when the right hand pulses are seen in the left hand, it is also a sign of inversion and bad omen. This defines life and death with Yin and Yang; how much more so with the pulse of the tiger&#39;s mouth?</p>
<p>From ages five to ten, once weaning is done and food is introduced, Yin and Yang are complete, thus a single finger can determine the three gates, measuring with precision akin to the nine indicators of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>In matters of child illness: the sound of crows, the passing of black stools, diarrhea with green pus, pulling at clothing seams, eyes staring too intently, speech being mumbling, smiling vacantly at others, turning face towards the ground, crying with no tears, eyes lacking luster, limbs lying flat against the ground, refusal of medicine at the mouth, limbs flat on the ground, a change in stools, sweating like beads, pulling eyebrows, biting nails, stretching the body, long sighs, a craving for cold water, legs curled like hooks, persistent stretching, vocal sounds being thunderous, fish-like mouth, sticking out the tongue, lips turning black, prolonged lip redness, unstable breathing, long-standing desire to eat dirt, eyes rolling back, spleen diarrhea changing into red dysentery, and other unexplainable symptoms.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Symptoms in Infants Before Three Months Old</strong></p>
<p>Symptoms include wind drooling, monkey-like convulsions, umbilical wind, pursed lips, coughing, silent noises, wooden tongue, heavy palate, stiff neck, and high chest. </p>
<p><strong>Pulse Colors</strong></p>
<p>A pure red pulse indicates a newly acquired illness, characterized by Yang and heat, suggesting the disease is external. A red and purple pulse indicates a transition in disease, suggesting there is heat both internally and externally, or heat alone indicating Yang. A red or purple pulse with hints of blue indicates a chronic disease, characterized by alternating cold and heat, reflecting external changes. A pure blue pulse indicates a prolonged illness, associated with both cold and heat, and is internal and Yin. A blue and yellow pulse suggests a severe transformation to cold, where extreme cold could turn to heat, making treatment difficult; it indicates a vacant cold affecting the five organs, with conflicting Yin and Yang symptoms. A blue and black pulse indicates a critical condition, possibly from a long-standing illness leading to a dark complexion. A black and yellow pulse, especially when showing the yellow, indicates a 90% chance of death, indicating great misfortune.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Face</strong></p>
<p>The face is red, indicating a deficiency of heart qi. Fire is associated with the heart and leads to rising heat, hence this is understood. The cessation of heart function results in death. Symptoms include clenching teeth and manipulating the tongue, a protruding tongue, ulcers in the mouth, a swollen tongue, a constricted throat, a white coating on the tongue, a heavy tongue underneath, a swollen throat, phlegm and saliva bubbling up, resembling a fish’s mouth; these signify a critical and severe condition. </p>
<p>When the left temple and the angles of the eyes show red veins, it indicates a transformation due to steaming heat, leading to restlessness and crying, with warmth in the head and abdomen, which may subside in a day or two. </p>
<p>When red veins appear on the Taiyin, it indicates a cold-induced condition, signifying strong heat and nasal congestion. </p>
<p>Red veins showing on the Wentai indicate a cold-induced condition lasting three days, signifying internal heat and headache. </p>
<p>If the red veins extend from the Taiyang to the Taiyin, it indicates heat both inside and outside; if also connecting to the Wentai, it signifies intense heat that doesn&#39;t resolve; progressing to the Wutai, symptoms may begin to change. </p>
<p>Red veins at the Yumen suggest conditions of heat and fright, leading to frequent startled movements, excessive chirping sounds, and difficulty sleeping at night. </p>
<p>Red veins from the forehead to the center of the eyebrows indicate conditions of fright wind and fever. If leading to the Yin Tang, it suggests fright phlegm and spasms with heat, indicating scanty urination. </p>
<p>Red veins at the Yin Tang suggest accumulated heat in the heart meridian.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>In the center of the eyebrows, the red veins connect to the Yintang, or there are red shadows. The heart and liver have concentrated heat in the upper jiao, with phlegm and fluids congesting the upper jiao, causing crying and phenomena of fright to arise. There is a protrusion under the left brow, signifying concealed fright, often manifesting as sudden jumps during sleep. </p>
<p>The red veins at the temples are swollen and protruding, indicating the presence of wind-heat phlegm causing fright, due to rising heat attacking urgently, as there is persistent heat phlegm in the heart and stomach, gradually leading to symptoms of fright wind. Cooling agents should be employed to dispel phlegm and relieve heat to restore calm. If the red veins at the temples lead to the Yintang, the symptoms of fright have been present for many days. </p>
<p>The red color at the left brow indicates unresolved steaming heat, with heat present in the liver and lungs; it should be treated with agents that clear the lungs and disperse wind-heat while regulating the stomach qi. </p>
<p>At the Fengchi point, the redness signifies wind-heat in the upper and middle jiao, indicating a potential for convulsions; it is recommended to eliminate wind and transform phlegm. </p>
<p>At the Quchi point, redness indicates that the lingering wind has transformed and is affecting the organs; there is heat present in the three jiao and frequent relieving is advised. Redness at the Yintang implies heat, fright, phlegm, and dietary issues; if nothing is expelled, it could lead to convulsions. </p>
<p>Red veins from the Yintang to the root of the nose signify heat in the heart and small intestine, with scanty red urine. From the root of the nose to the nasal column has redness, indicating heat in the heart and stomach, with both urine and stool being red and scanty. </p>
<p>The redness extending from the Yintang to the upper Zhu indicates accumulated heat in the three jiao, which can be curbed with cooling agents. </p>
<p>Above the Zhu, red-yellow is stable and free of affliction.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>The red pulse at the Yimen indicates an external kidney condition caused by wind and warmth, leading to heat and irritability. The red on the face suggests internal agitation and heat.</p>
<p>The red pulses on the right Taiyang and corners of the mouth are due to the infant&#39;s nursing mother suffering from a cold, causing obstructed milk and resulting in issues like milk tumors with wind-heat phlegm. The red pulse on the right Taiyin arises from the mother having a heat illness along with phlegm in the milk, potentially inducing phlegm. The red pulse at Wutai gradually develops into symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea due to fright.</p>
<p>The red pulse at Fengchi indicates that the mother does not avoid spicy foods or pork and mutton bone soup, possibly leading to toxic milk causing wind. The red pulse at Qichi shows that if the mother has heat and phlegm, even when the child reaches ten years, signs of the illness may still manifest. The heat-phlegm from the mother enters the child&#39;s five viscera, resulting in blurred vision and transmitting other diseases. The red pulse at Yimen indicates a kidney qi issue, related to the mother consuming beverages or odd foods, and eating chicken, geese, ducks, fish, garlic, which may lead to different illnesses later on.</p>
<p><strong>Seven Manifestations</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is floating, slippery, full, tight, and surging.<br>The floating pulse indicates wind and loss of blood, the slippery pulse suggests discernible vomiting and clear downward movement. The tight pulse indicates tension while the surging pulse typically signifies heat.</p>
<p><strong>Eight Li</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is slightly sunken, slow, soft, retracted, moist, and weak.<br>A slow and cold pulse with slight hardness indicates distress, while the hard pulse suggests stagnation of bad blood and moisture. The retracted pulse indicates pain from stagnation and cold, while the weak pulse suggests a subsequent deficiency character.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Nine Patterns</strong></p>
<p>Long and short pulses, vacuity and fullness, rapid and slow, all indicate different conditions. A long pulse suggests yang deficiency in the triple warmer; a short pulse indicates that food is not digesting properly in the chest. A vacuous pulse often brings about surprise and confusion, while a rapid pulse signifies a critical situation from which it is hard to escape. A knotty pulse indicates qi stagnation leading to emaciation, while a firm pulse suggests vigorous heat as if the bones are being scorched. If the pulse is moving, it suggests a risk of blood loss and fragility; a fine pulse indicates sourness in the limbs and a tendency toward weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Observation of Infants</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, observe the two eyes for vitality; secondly, check the clarity and loudness of the voice; thirdly, examine the top of the head; fourthly, assess the appearance; and fifthly, look at the hair. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The two eyes gather the essence of the five organs and house the spirit of the whole body. If the pupils are dark and full of luster, and the spirit is bright and lively, it suggests the child will live long and have few illnesses, recovering easily even if they become sick. If the whites of the eyes are excessive and the pupils are dull or yellow, this indicates a weakness in their constitution, leading to many ailments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A loud and clear voice shows robust qi from the five organs, aiding the child in growing strong. If the child is born without crying, or if the voice does not emerge, this suggests a blockage in the yin passages of one or two organs, indicating timidity and frailty; or if the sound is feeble or like a weak whisper, this signifies that the child will not live long and will be difficult to raise.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The crown of the head relates to the mother’s qi and blood; a firm and strong crown indicates good nourishment for the child. If the mother suffers from illness or her qi and blood are weak, the child&#39;s crown will be soft and insubstantial. The back of the head relates to the father’s essence; if rich and substantial, it allows the child’s back of the head to be strong and well-nourished.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If a father&#39;s vital energy is insufficient and he excessively indulges in wine, the child may have a weak and unsteady head and will also have a short life. If both parents are timid, their offspring will also not live long. In such cases, the parents will not reach a long life. The front and rear points are referred to as the &quot;trust gates,&quot; with the Daoists calling it the &quot;mud pill.&quot; The rear trust is known as the &quot;brain top gate.&quot; The center of the head is also called the &quot;hundred meetings point.&quot; Hua Tuo described facial readings in great detail. The front and rear trust, as well as the hundred meetings, if open and vacuous, are referred to as &quot;uncovered skull.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fourth, in terms of appearance, a wide mouth and pointed nose, with raised eyebrows and bright eyes, indicate a child who grows easily and possesses strong blessings. Conversely, a small mouth and bent nose, with a concave and wrinkled brow, may lead to strange traits in the child, resulting in either poverty or early death — this is difficult to decipher.</p>
<p>Fifth, hair is the residue of blood. If the mother&#39;s blood and energy are abundant, the hair will be black and lustrous. If the mother&#39;s blood is deficient, leaking, or failing, with irregular menstruation, or if she indulges in excessive drinking and debauchery, or if there are disturbances from the womb, the child&#39;s hair will be yellow and withered, leading to ailments like sores or fevers.</p>
<p>In observing a child’s spirit, color, and pulse, all fall within these five aspects. It’s impossible to see them all, but if the child’s eyes are spirited and their voice is clear, this may ensure their well-being. This is the secret technique passed down by the Wang family of Han Dong.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>A Brief Treatise on Pediatric Medicine</strong></p>
<p>In pediatric medicine, the discipline is called &quot;silent discipline.&quot; The child cannot speak, and the pulse cannot be measured; one must rely solely on their appearance and color, exhausting all thoughts to apply treatment. Therefore, those who are skilled in nurturing children treat them as if raising a dragon for careful care; those who are unskilled treat them as tender calves and cherish them. The more one loves them, the more harm one inadvertently causes. At times, their head may feel warm but their feet are cold; suddenly, they cry a lot but refuse milk. A small error can lead to a huge loss. This specialized pediatric medicine serves to address what conventional practices fail to cover.</p>
<p>The intestines and stomach are fragile and easily harmed by food; the muscles and bones are weak and easily attacked by wind and cold. Parents should be aware and carefully observe the child&#39;s condition. Thick and heavy clothing may hinder warmth and drain vital energy; excessively forcing milk or food merely disrupts the spleen and harms the stomach. Hearing unusual sounds or seeing unfamiliar objects can lead to neglect in prevention; it is necessary to provide a secure environment and limit excessive outings, avoiding over-attentiveness.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>Without waiting, one takes action and rejoices in their growth; when idle, one laughs and is called wise. But one day, illness arises, and the hearts of parents are troubled. Distrusting doctors, they instead believe in shamans, seeking ghosts rather than medicine. Thus, the neglect of human affairs is blamed on fate.</p>
<p>To observe one&#39;s complexion, one must first discern the parts of the body. The left cheek belongs to the Green Dragon and is associated with the liver; the right cheek belongs to the White Tiger and is related to the lungs. The forehead, high and separated, embodies the heart’s fire, while the lower regions correspond to the kidney&#39;s water. The nose is at the center of the face, connecting to the spleen. By observing the colors that manifest, one can understand the origins of diseases. Moreover, the spleen corresponds to the lips, the lungs to the nose, the tongue reflects the heart, and the eyes signify the liver&#39;s fluids. The stomach flows to the lower jaw, while the kidneys open through the ears. The nails are remnants of the tendons, with the spleen governing them, while hair reflects the surplus blood, under the kidney&#39;s dominion. The spleen governs the limbs, and the kidneys connect to the teeth. If any of the internal organs decline, then the corresponding parts will surely weaken first.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Able to discern shape and color, resembling a beam striking a bell; if I am unaware of my omens, it’s like a stone thrown into water. All that is observed externally can reveal the internal. The red color signifies market heat, the blue color exposes and startles the heart. Like the blackness of coal, it indicates malice; like the yellow of oranges, it represents spleen deficiency. White signifies illness and exhaustion, purple indicates acute heat. Blue hides the mouth corners, making it difficult for the physician Bian Que to treat; black obscures the sun, making it impossible for physician Lu to cure. The longevity marked by red light often produces pus and blood, while the blue color found at the root of the mountains frequently heralds disasters. To discern colors in order to understand causes, one cannot merely follow diagrams to seek steeds.</p>
<p>The Vermilion Bird pierces through the double pupils, fire enters the watery lands; the Azure Dragon coils around the four whites, the liver sits in the lung&#39;s position. One must be cautious of those with diarrhea accompanied by yang, and one should fear those with coughs dragging in blue. The belly pain emerges deep, the face remains pale with pursed lips; when a wind of fright is about to break, the cheeks become red first and the eyes bulge.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The flames burn brightly, feeling the chill of the wind outside; the golden essence floats, harboring hidden ailments within. Sometimes yellow, sometimes white, lingering heat; both blue and red, urgent with wind evils. Observing carefully leads to proper treatment. The cries of crows and the mouths of fish waste effort and thought; flesh bends and skin dries, laboring in vain.</p>
<p>The complexion changes, the appearance alters. When energy wanes, the jaw becomes a pit; when blood weakens, hair on the head stands like a tuft. Eyes produce tear-like mucus, the liver wind clouds the sight; the mouth drips saliva, the spleen is cold and stagnant. The face appears hollow, likely to swell and wheeze; if the brows furrow, then abdominal pain leads to weeping. Worms emerge, the spleen and stomach begin to fail; sores hide above, while the lower intestines suffer first. If one remains dazed and unhealed, even deities would be of no help!</p>
<p>The hands resemble claws, startled by the onset of wind; the face is as if painted with vermilion, the heart fire already blazing.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>I enjoy sitting and lying down in the cold, troubled by the heat’s assault; I stretch and contract out of fear of the wind and chill. My belly is large while my feet are small; my spleen wants to be at ease but instead degenerates. My eyes are wide open and my mouth agape, the situation is dire and I am destined to perish. Playing with my tongue burns my spleen, relieving my head and exhausting my kidneys. A heavy tongue and a wooden tongue suggest heat accumulating in the heart and spleen; suffocating breaths indicate real fire surging in the liver and lungs. When the gums are swollen and exposed, it surely means dental decay; if I nurse with slackness, it often relates to food stagnation. My lips are dry and parched, and my intestines rumble freely. Nighttime crying falls into four categories, changing with the seasons throughout the year. My heart is hot and longs to speak but cannot; my spleen is weak, making me lethargic at all times. Those who lose their voice after illness have weak kidneys; coughing without a voice indicates lung atrophy. If there is abdominal pain with a clear watery discharge, it suggests worms; if there is belly pain with foul-smelling stools, it points to accumulation. Frequent puckering of the mouth reflects a weak spleen, while a long, stretched tongue signifies fiery ardor.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>The turtle&#39;s chest is swollen with fire in the lungs; the turtle&#39;s back signifies wind in the kidneys entering the marrow. Dryness and darkness in the nose indicate excessive fire diminishing metal; a large abdomen with blue veins suggests strong wood causing the earth to collapse. </p>
<p>Red tumors and sores are all consequences of lingering toxic conditions; vomiting and diarrhea, as well as dysentery, are due to the obstruction of accumulated food. Those who cannot suckle experience heat in the heart and spleen; those who wish to lie face down have fire steaming their intestines and stomach. </p>
<p>A liking for light indicates heat in the heart; a craving for earth shows a heat condition in the spleen. Abdominal pain from cold invasion and mouth sores suggest heat accumulation. Navel wind is to be avoided during adolescence, while fire sores are to be feared at the age of one. </p>
<p>Surprise stemming from internal heat leads to convulsions caused by phlegm. Those who experience vomiting and diarrhea with depleted energy are in danger; those with dysentery and reduced appetite will certainly suffer. Surprise originates from the heart, while wind arises from the liver. </p>
<p>Symptoms may present on either side, indicating the direction of the condition; medicine should be administered based on whether the illness is deficient or excessive. Sudden surprise arises from deep accumulated heat, wherein cooling methods are more suitable; chronic surprise after a major illness requires warming and tonifying treatments.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The head shakes and the eyes dart while breathing is labored; the skilled doctor cannot heal. The mouth is bound, the nose flares and the feet are cold; what use are divine elixirs? Those who close their eyes lack a soul, and those who shout in madness attract many woes. Those unaware of their intake and output will surely meet Yama; those who exacerbate their discomfort will ultimately return to the wilds. </p>
<p>Having understood the symptoms, next comes the knowledge of adjusting and treating. To clear fetal toxins, use licorice and coptis; for food accumulation, use atractylodes and bitter orange. Sudden fright with convulsions should be treated with red-dispelling methods; chronic fright with spasms requires replenishing the middle and boosting energy. Gather the holy to expel dampness, and prepare for urgent treatment of accumulation. </p>
<p>The Dragon-Holding Pill transforms phlegm and calms fright; the Stomach Spirit Pill nourishes the kidneys and opens the appetite. Nightly crying must retreat heat and clarify the heart; evening heat should nourish blood and elevate energy. Regulate to stop diarrhea with fragrant coptis and control dysentery. If accumulated heat is not cleared, the Cool Fright Pill is highly effective; for deep-seated cold that is hard to treat, the Spleen Nourishing Pill holds the greatest secret. </p>
<p>Phlegm and fire attacking within is treated with the Three Huang Pill; undigested water and grains require just one golden pill.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Chai Ling treats malaria, while Yue Chan alleviates bloating. Tide heat corresponds with golden blossoms, and coughs are soothed with precious fluids. For sores and scabs, use sesame; for red tumors, cooling medications. For those who vomit and thirst, Bai Zhu can be given; for those who are agitated and thirsty, Yi Yuan is the best. Rashes can be detoxified, and abdominal pain can be attributed to spleen accumulation. For nosebleeds and coughing blood, use an infusion of plantain; for heavy and coated tongues, acupuncture is needed. If mouth ulcers do not heal, cleanse the heart; for abdominal bloating and loss of appetite, regulate the stomach. The five wringing techniques treat wheezing, while the four Ling formulas promote water excretion. Counteracting jaundice and reducing swelling can be managed with adjusted stomach formulas; breaking accumulations and calming parasites requires the collected wisdom of the saints. Generally, infants are prone to both deficiency and excess. The key is to maintain balance in treatment, ensuring that replenishment and drainage do not exceed their doses. One should especially avoid Ba Niu and refrain from excessive use of mineral substances. Spicy heat disperses by consuming yin, while bitter cold destroys yang and damages the stomach. If encountering food stagnation, resolve it without delay; if faced with deficiency and weakness, supplementation is most urgent. A short delay can lead to exhaustion and decline.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Caring for the Young and Guarding the Heart</strong></p>
<p>In the realm of medicine, the treatment of infants is the most challenging. Their digestive system is delicate and easily harmed by milk and food, their bones are tender and susceptible to wind and cold. They are quick to become weak or robust as if by turning the hand, and the response to treatment can vary; sometimes, one must nourish or drain with the utmost care. Salty flavors often act on the kidneys, while sour tastes support the liver. Bitter flavors harm the stomach and chill it, while pungent flavors move to the lungs and create dryness that damages the essence. One seeks balance and moderation, avoiding extremes in taste.</p>
<p>In cases of illness, beware of dizziness and avoid toxic remedies; treatment should be appropriate to the situation and based on what is effective. When recognizing a central ailment, prioritize the root cause. If one rashly resorts to herbal decoctions, it may lead to grievous consequences. This reflects the skilled practitioner’s commitment to preserving life, while a good doctor’s judgment is proven through the cure of broken bones.</p>
<p>I have heard that there are no fixed rules in medicine, only observations of symptoms; do not administer potions without thorough understanding. Those who are ill must be careful in choosing their treatments, and doctors should focus on ensuring recovery. Treat illness as if it were your own, and do not be greedy for personal gain.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>First, observe the circulation of Qi and the subtle harmony of Yin and Yang; then, examine the appearance and demeanor, grasping the trends of fortune and misfortune. In spring and summer, Yang prevails and the bitterness of cold can be utilized, as evidenced by a person&#39;s vitality; in autumn and winter, Yin prevails and warmth can alleviate the suffering, reflecting the labor and illness of individuals. If one warms and restores, then one can counteract the cold and expel. When the Seven Spirits disperse and the Five Organs weaken and collapse, even if one diligently checks the pulse, what remedy exists for the world? It may lead to premature demise and incur divine wrath. Thus, in case of fetal distress, one must urgently detoxify; for food stagnation, the benefit lies in digesting it. Treatment is divided into two methods, and efficacy can be complete. When the swaddling is unsettled, simply adjust the mother; if the infant does not crawl well, then strengthen its vitality. Alas, the balance of the stomach and intestines cannot tolerate medicinals or stones; there is a subtlety in the Qi and blood that is weak and requires gradual nurturing. Treatment is not undertaken lightly; illness can strike suddenly. Like guarding a flickering candle, the heart must remain vigilant; like treasuring a precious pearl, one must focus earnestly. Medicine can augment fate; one should not bring shame to family traditions. Moreover, when illness arises, heat emerges; when heat arises, anxiety follows.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>Some treat heat with heat, while others attack heat with cold. When heat is superficial, herbs like mulberry and ramie can relieve the muscles and can be ingested; when heat is internal, herbs like gentian and scutellaria can eliminate toxins and must be decocted urgently. For accumulated heat, nothing compares to gathering the sages&#39; wisdom; for empty heat, it’s best to adjust the vital essence. It is crucial to understand the pulse and complexion, and not to recklessly administer prescriptions. Missteps can lead to lifelong ailments or shorten an infant&#39;s lifespan. Treating lightly can aggravate a condition, and actions alone cannot resolve problems. Simply entrusting oneself to fate without careful examination leads to misfortune. Past mistakes remain as warnings for future actions. The soul wanders in the fields, its cries resonate in the depths of springs. Given these reasons, whose fault is it? Alas! Even ants can cross bridges, and sparrows can escape nets. How much more so for the essence of all things, which is not to be valued less than a lowly insect. Ignorance of caution leads to hasty recklessness. Compassionate conscience is like seeing someone fall into a well; studying the teachings of the sages is essential, as if not reaching the water source. One must be at ease yet vigilant, knowing peace by understanding danger. Evidence follows in various forms, and treatment must not be one-sided.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>Regulate the transformation of essence and preserve true vitality. It is better to be adept in temple rituals than in assault; it is better to act slowly than to rush. Planting apricots forms a grove, following in the footsteps of Dong Feng; planting oranges by the famous well reflects the legacy of Su Dan today. Alas, chronic leakage leads to dysentery, long-term accumulation results in ulcers, persistent fever causes distension, and excessive fright leads to convulsions. If one has not lingered yet, treatment should be swift; if diseases are already evident, treatment should be gradual. For secretive blockages in the intestines and stomach, prompt expulsion is essential; for deficiencies in qi and blood, swift nourishment is required for stabilization. External toxins must be urgently attacked, lest they enter the abdomen; the urgent dispelling of surface pathogens should not be allowed to transmit again. Thus, I would proceed slowly and with care, fearing that haste may lead to complications. Just as one swallows medicine, one must guard against excess; when treating somewhat serious conditions, do not overstretch one’s capabilities. The wise always consider potential missteps; those who have died cannot be restored to wholeness. Rather than regret what has already occurred, it is better to be cautious about what has yet to happen. If one seeks fish and rabbits, one must protect the reed and hoof. If many methods are employed to treat diseases, three reflections upon these words are advisable!</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Children</strong></p>
<p>For a red face and fever, administer cool medicine; for yellow and white fever, use Stomach Ling. For body heat and constipation, administer the Three Huang; for weak and feverish children, gather the Holy Spirit. For transformation and evaporative heat, use the pressure method; for convulsions, direct the red to swallow the green. For diarrhea, use one pill of Stomach Ling; for heat-related diarrhea, the Jade Dew Powder should be taken together. For cold diarrhea, the Regulating Center Pill can be consumed; for thirst, the White Atractylodes Powder generates fluids. Dysentery can be treated with the Harmonizing and Scenting Powder; malaria can be alleviated by nourishing the spleen, allowing the malaria to naturally resolve. For coughs, the Jade Liquid dispels phlegm and qi; swelling can be treated with Stomach Ling to guide it to the heart. For sores and scabies, Black Sesame Pills are the best, and nourishing the spleen is most crucial for protecting infants. For roundworms, use the White Pill; make sure to give precise instructions on temporary medications.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Observing Tiger Mouth Patterns</strong></p>
<p>Modern practitioners focus on the patterns of the tiger’s mouth, examining the wind, qi, and life conditions. Wind conditions indicate light illnesses, while qi conditions indicate severe issues; if life conditions are poor, death is imminent. Blue signifies shock, red represents heat, and black indicates malevolent forces; one must carefully observe the clouds to assess the severity.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Method</strong></p>
<p>For children, a single finger divides into three positions, with six beats indicating the pulse; seven to eight beats signify heat, while three to four beats suggest a slow, weak, or cold condition. A firm and balanced pulse indicates health, while a thin, weak, or slow pulse suggests illness.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Conditions</strong></p>
<p>When children eat dirt, heat in the spleen is countered with yellow purging methods. Intermittent administration of divine remedies is crucial, as it helps counteract the effects of malnutrition. If a child sleeps with a pale face, it indicates heat in the heart; treat it with Dao Chi San to cool and expel heat. If a child has frequent pale urine resembling rice wash, administering Wei Ling Salt Soup is recommended, followed by several doses of Jie You decoction. For children with green stools, it indicates heat in the liver channel; using Xie Qing Wan is remarkably effective. If the stools are dry and yellow, it suggests heat in the spleen; one may find that Xie Huang San is an extraordinary remedy.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Water Mirror Formula</strong></p>
<p>The operation of yin and yang brings about the formation of men and women. Once the nine orifices and four limbs are divided, the five viscera and six bowels are born. Each part is distinct, and distinguishing between order and disorder can be difficult. If one relies solely on the fluctuations at the pulse point, it can lead to disastrous outcomes in children. </p>
<p>One must clarify the tiger&#39;s mouth, discern the three gates, and carefully analyze medicinal usage to avoid mistakes. Up to the age of three, only the tiger’s mouth should be examined, with boys on the left and girls on the right, at the second finger. The first segment is called the Wind Gate; if the pulse shows initial signs, it indicates sickness. The second segment is the Qi Gate; if the pulse is detected here, treatment is difficult. The third segment is the Life Gate; if the pulse is evident, it signifies death.</p>
<p>One should also distinguish colors; if the three gates are blue, it indicates surprise in the four limbs; if they are red, it points to watery aversion; if they are black, it signifies shock. Purple indicates diarrhea, while yellow suggests thunderous surprise. If the pulse at the three gates is unobstructed, it is a sign of imminent danger; otherwise, the illness can be treated. A pattern of either blue or red, with a line-like stripe, indicates damage from food and heat-induced surprise. If both sides are the same, it signals simultaneous surprise and accumulation.</p>
<p>If there are three or if it disperses, it shows wind phlegm from the lungs or indicates a dry cough with sound. Blue indicates cold damage and cough, while fiery red indicates diarrhea. A combination of black indicates diarrhea, while predominant blue indicates more white diarrhea, and predominant red points to more red diarrhea, accompanied by a purple shade that adds thirst but is not false. Disordered pulse patterns at the tiger&#39;s mouth signify disharmony in the stomach qi. </p>
<p>Indeed, when color is observed in the pulse patterns—be it yellow, red, purple, or blue—this indicates that the illness is severe, with colors capable of changing according to the severity of the affliction.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>If the color is like yellow and red, the abundance of red turns to purple; if the color is red and purple, the abundance of purple turns to green; if the color is purple and green, the abundance of green turns to black; if the color is green and black, arriving at pure black, it cannot be treated. </p>
<p>There are also distinctions in the shapes of the pulse: for the long pearl shape, it indicates accumulated damage and stagnation, causing abdominal pain, and difficulty digesting cold and hot foods; for the snake shape, it indicates disharmony at the center, accumulated qi attacking, organs in disarray, and dry heaving; for the outgoing snake shape, it indicates spleen deficiency with cold accumulation leading to diarrhea, causing the spirit to feel lethargic and sleepy. The reverse bow shape indicates the invasion of cold and hot evil energy, with heaviness in the head and eyes, the heart disturbed and weary, cold in the limbs, and red urination. The outward bow shape indicates phlegm-heat causing mental confusion, presenting symptoms of heat, shock, and food wind convulsions. The spear shape indicates strong phlegm-heat producing wind, causing convulsions and shocks. The fishbone shape indicates startled phlegm-heat. The water character shape indicates shock and accumulated heat causing agitation, the spirit feeling lost and heavy, night crying with excessive phlegm, and mouth twitching. The needle shape indicates heat affecting the heart and lungs, extreme heat giving rise to wind, causing fright and discomfort, with lethargy and loss of appetite, and strong phlegm leading to twitching. The penetrating pulse of the shooting finger indicates four symptoms of wind, phlegm, and heat, all concentrated in the chest and diaphragm without dispersing. The penetrating pulse of the shooting nail indicates wind shock and adverse conditions, with the shock transmitted into the meridians. When wind and heat arise, the mortality rate is one in ten, making it difficult to treat. These thirteen pulse shapes all have varying degrees of severity; observing their disease roots will clarify their symptoms.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Tang&#39;s Method of Observing the Tiger Mouth Pulse</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born until the age of five, their blood and qi are not yet stable, and their breathing may be excessive. One must observe the pulse color at the tiger mouth to discern the true nature of the illness. For boys, check the left hand, and for girls, the right hand. The left hand corresponds to yang, which is dominant in boys; the right hand corresponds to yin, which is dominant in girls. However, both men and women possess both yin and yang in their bodies, and both hands should be examined. The patterns on the left hand indicate issues with the heart and liver; the patterns on the right hand indicate issues with the lungs and spleen. Understanding this information allows for adaptability in diagnosis. </p>
<p>For initial cases of frightful wind, the pattern at the tiger mouth may appear red, often more so at the initial phase. If it progresses to the middle phase, the color turns bright red and purple. If the illness continues to worsen, the color becomes purple-blue, signaling deeper illness. A pattern that is blue-black with disordered pulse lines indicates serious ailment. If pure black is observed, it signifies a critical and untreatable condition.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Generally, red indicates mild wind-heat, while bright red denotes severe wind-heat. Purple suggests sudden heat, and green indicates sudden accumulation. When green and red are equally present, it signifies both sudden accumulation and wind-heat, suggesting an urgent need to address sudden wind symptoms. If there is a pale purple with green, characterized by movements back and forth, it indicates slow onset of wind symptoms. In cases where purple threads, green threads, and black threads are subtly mixed, appearing intermittently, it indicates a chronic spleen wind condition. </p>
<p>If the pulse pattern starts at the yin gate and does not reach the mao gate, the illness is relatively easy to treat; however, if it connects to the mao gate, the condition is difficult to treat. If it connects from the yin gate to the mao gate and then invades beyond the chen gate, the prognosis is extremely poor, with a one in ten chance of recovery. </p>
<p>If the pulse pattern is small or short, there is no harm in examining the illness. If the pulse waves curve inward, while the illness may be severe, the condition shows conformity and can still be treated with effort. However, if the pulse waves bow outward and are closely linked to the nail, it should not be reversed. When the pulse at the three gates appears like flowing pearls or fragmented rice, with three to five points connected, manifesting on the face or body, the situation is particularly dire.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing the Patterns of Pulse in the Tiger&#39;s Mouth</strong></p>
<p>Yellow, formless, indicates the pulse of tranquility. Red, if similarly formless, also signifies a peaceful pulse. Patterns resembling earlier forms indicate illness. They change in sequence, beginning with a dot, gradually increasing in the qi gate with more pulse lines, reaching the life gate when the condition becomes critical. Pure black is distinct and cannot be treated.</p>
<p>On the left, if there are red lines resembling lines, it indicates fever accompanied by shock. On the right, if there are double lines resembling those on the left, it is a sign of spleen injury with shock accumulation. If the ends of the lines resemble a trident, it suggests lung qi producing phlegm that manifests at night. The blue also corresponds to cold damage but is simply empty red producing leakage.</p>
<p>Identifying blue lines on the fingers indicates sudden fright. The blue pulse in the tiger&#39;s mouth indicates fright from pigs, dogs, or horses. Black suggests shock from water, while red indicates fright in adults. Purple often leads to diarrhea, whereas yellow signifies fright from thunder. Curved back wind greatly intensifies; bow-shaped patterns indicate food reverse.</p>
<p>One can discern the shape only by observing the intersection of fingers. For children over three years old, if gravely ill or in critical condition, one often observes black coloring around the nails, mouth, and nose. This indicates an absolute pulse where the spirit is trapped, and the condition is extremely severe; even with skilled doctors, recovery is virtually impossible.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p>
<h3>General Treatment</h3>
<p>Children have a pure Yang constitution, and both Yin and Yang must not be harmed. They often carry a little hunger and coolness; such children are easy to nurture. Generally, the spleen is often insufficient, while excess liver energy must be guarded against. Neutral medicine, neither cold nor hot, is best; it is essential to avoid reckless and violent treatments.  </p>
<p>Why are children difficult to treat? Historically, it is referred to as the &quot;mute disease.&quot; The pulse cannot be observed easily, and the child cannot express their illness. Parents are often anxious, and physicians conduct many tests with sincerity. It is challenging to prescribe medicine confidently when faced with such uncertainty.</p>
<h3>Treatise on the Forehead, Center of the Brow, and Mountain Root</h3>
<p>When the forehead is red, hot, and dry, a blue color may indicate liver wind. A green hue at the center of the brow signifies fear, resulting in redness due to fire. If suddenly black qi appears, it is a result of external evil influencing the body. A faint green shade at the mountain root suggests that shock can double the severity. If this area is still red, restlessness will definitely ensue.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>On the Decay of Years</strong></p>
<p>The aging years quietly turn yellow as the proper hue, if evenly distributed, face untimely misfortune. Suddenly, black represents dysentery&#39;s threat, with cholera&#39;s violent yellow vomit seen deep.</p>
<p><strong>On the Arch of the Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The arch of the mouth appears blue, indicative of shock when eating, with much yellow leading to reverse vomiting and red dysentery manifestations. Nighttime restlessness and crying show a blue color indicating good fortune, whereas prolonged illness with red brows signals certain death.</p>
<p><strong>On the Wind and Qi Pools at the Mandibles</strong></p>
<p>The wind and qi pools display yellow reverse vomiting, with anxiety and cries revealing a bright red hue. The two mandibles can also appear red as buds, suggesting that heat in the lungs is not without reason.</p>
<p><strong>On the Eyes</strong></p>
<p>The whites of the eyes show blue due to liver wind; should they turn yellow, it indicates stagnation. Observing black in the pupils with yellow trace reveals the source of the severe cold illness.</p>
<p><strong>On the Nose</strong></p>
<p>The nose tip is slightly yellow, balancing with a red-white hue; deep yellow dryness leads to a hazardous black indicating difficulty in survival. A shortened philtrum suggests vomiting due to dysentery, while darkened lips indicate worms leaning towards danger.</p>
<p><strong>On the Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth&#39;s natural redness suggests balance, while dryness denotes spleen heat generating a yellow accumulation. White indicates blood loss, with black encircling the mouth; a blue-black hue signifies shock from wind leading to certain death.</p>
<p><strong>On the Temples</strong></p>
<p>The temples appear blue, indicative of initial shock, while red brings forth the onset of distress. To understand the signs of impending death, one sees that blue marks the beginning of influence on the ears.</p>
<p><strong>On the Face</strong><a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>If both cheeks appear yellow, it indicates phlegm excess; a greenish color suggests a conflict between hot and cold. A red face in cases of cold damage suggests urinary issues; thus, details regarding the two cheeks should be thoroughly examined.</p>
<p>When facing a child&#39;s ailments, first observe their shape and color, then proceed to pulse examination. The overall facial color can indicate various conditions: a blueish hue points to fear or an imbalance of energy; a reddish tint indicates phlegm accumulation or restlessness; yellowness suggests food blockage leading to digestive issues; paleness points to weak lung energy, resulting in excess discharge or diarrhea; a blackish hue indicates critical issues with internal organs. </p>
<p>A blue face with blue eyes indicates liver ailments; a red face reflects heart issues; a pale face relates to lung conditions; a yellow face corresponds to spleen problems; and a black face indicates kidney concerns. First, distinguish which organ is affected; next, assess their balance of energy, the state of their prenatal vitality, and the conditions of yin and yang. It&#39;s crucial to address any excess or deficiency effectively. Understanding the connections between the internal organs and their exterior manifestations is key for skilled practitioners.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>Secret of Raising Infants</strong> by Wan Quan (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Essay on Subtlety</strong></p>
<p>The field of medicine is vast, and pediatrics is the most challenging. Just as the shoots of grass are precious in their nurturing, so too must we be cautious in preserving the sprouts of silkworms. When the blood and qi are not fully developed, the pulses cannot be diagnosed; when the spirit is not awakened, the infant cannot speak. Truly seeking from the heart, one must carefully observe the face. If one grasps the essentials, they can wield the forces of creation with masterful hands; if one does not comprehend the purpose, they merely extract phrases from a fragmented text. </p>
<p>If care is neglected, illness will arise. The head should be cool while the back must be warm; do not overfeed, and do not dress in too much fabric. The intestines and stomach are delicate, and excessive nursing can cause accumulation; if the spirit is timid and weak, strange sights and sounds can induce convulsions. Alas, kind mothers, being overly indulgent, and mocking those with clumsy methods, make mistakes with porridge and pills. They suppress the vital energy of growth, jeopardizing the childhood years. Crying out on the hills and fields is futile, and praying for relief at altars is pointless. </p>
<p>To recognize symptoms is crucial, and knowledge of life and death is essential. It does not lie near the fingertips, but relies on the face in between. When heart fire ascends, one can observe at the crown; when kidney water descends, one should observe at the soles. The right cheek is gold and pertains to the lungs, the left cheek is wood and pertains to the liver. The spleen&#39;s territory is between the nose and the bridge. Blue indicates fright and red signifies heat; yellow represents accumulation and white signals dysentery. Like the black of coal, it points to malice; like the purple of ochre, it indicates an invasion of wind and cold. </p>
<p>If the prenatal constitution is weak, the hair will be sparse and the head soft; if the constitution is robust, the flesh will be ample and the bones strong. If the nature is calm, there will be little laughter; if the spirit is weary, there will be much sleep.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>Heat in the lungs causes turbid mucus to accumulate in the nose; cold in the spleen leads to clear saliva stagnating in the jaws. The eyes are linked and speak of liver wind; the pupils gaze straight, reflecting the flame of the heart&#39;s fire. When energy is insufficient, the spirit sinks; if it rises, it indicates heat. Excess blood gives a flushed face, while a pale yellow complexion indicates deficiency.</p>
<p>Those who move slowly show weak kidneys; those who cry frequently are troubled at heart. A hot spleen causes tongue movements, while a strong liver results in clenched fists. Hair standing on end signals the gradual rise of consumption; a cracking head suggests a possible collapse. Skin tightens while flesh withers, signifying a loss of vital energy and an impending departure; an elevated nose and retracted lips show that the essence of grains has been cut off and is difficult to regain. A red worm enters the eye, no need to consult Lu Bian; a green snake coils around the mouth, no need to ask about the divine pill!</p>
<p>Each organ has its symptoms, which can be understood in a word. The liver governs wind, causing crying and frustration; the heart controls heat, leading to palpitations and yawning. The lungs govern qi, resulting in wheezing, coughing, and sneezing; the spleen governs feelings of heaviness, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and desire for sleep. Only the kidneys are inherently deficient, being connected to life. The liver often has excess, which generates wind; the spleen is frequently insufficient, leading to deficiency disorders. Wood overpowering earth leads to prolonged diarrhea and spasms that cannot be treated; fire affecting metal causes persistent coughs that result in a debilitating condition.</p>
<p>Within a month, the umbilical wind is most dangerous; within a century, phlegm and coughs are particularly difficult. There is no condition more perilous than a mid-illness crisis; no urgency greater than flowing dan (a type of poison). If transformation is exhausted during the year, it must be measured by the days. If convulsions arise in a timely manner, it is hard to depend on days for relief. Those who suffer will groan; those who lose what they desire will sigh in despair.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>During the day there is constant shouting, a sign of heat in the liver; at night there is much weeping, indicating cold in the spleen. </p>
<p>Those born with illness suffer from fetal toxins; those who can eat but are ill suffer from food accumulation. The changes from fetal toxins manifest as jaundice, tumors, and sores; the changes from food accumulation show as symptoms of pain and a feeling of fullness. Vomiting and diarrhea can be caused by cold or heat or food, while coughing may stem from deficiency, excess, or phlegm. Dysentery arises from accumulation, while malaria persists due to fullness. </p>
<p>Bloating is due to deficiency of the spleen and stomach, while swelling results from wind and dampness. Hernias originate in the liver, while painful urination is due to heat in the bladder; jaundice arises from the spleen, and thirst is due to dryness of fluids. </p>
<p>Wind arises from the liver, and heat dwells in the heart. When wind and heat combine, it causes severe spasms; prolonged vomiting and diarrhea result in a chronic state. Conditions can be classified into eight signs, and thorough treatment is critical. If phlegm has not been eliminated, there will be difficulty in speaking; if qi and blood have not been restored, there will be contractions of the limbs. </p>
<p>There may be a hanging sensation that feels like a spasm and shoots upward; internal hanging sensations can feel like a hernia or cause internal pain. A slight disturbance may feel like inner malaise; pain from parasites resembles convulsions. When signs and symptoms are confused with one another, diagnosis and treatment should be detailed and careful.</p>
<p>A white membrane in the eyes indicates a liver disorder; redness and ulcers below the nose signify a lung condition. Intense heat and thirst suggest evil fire attacking the palace of crimson; numerous sores and emaciation indicate the depletion of true fluids at the source. Injuries to diet lead to spleen damage; loss of fluids results in a dry stomach. The gradual thinning of limbs corresponds to the inability to nourish from spoiled grain.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>Loving to eat clay, with a yellow face, white teeth, and a shiny scalp; delighting in fruits, with a greedy mouth and a full, firm belly. The symptoms of illness are clear, and the treatment method is simple. To regulate the stomach and dry dampness, use Wuling and Pingwei, combining them to relieve both vomiting and diarrhea; for purging heat and dispelling wind, using the two formulas can also alleviate sudden convulsions. The coolness of golden flowers reduces fever, while the soothing jade liquid transforms phlegm. To harmonize the body and relieve accumulation, using Tongxiang can treat dysentery; while Yigong can nourish the spleen, assisting in the recovery from tuberculosis. To stop vomiting and diarrhea, with common strategies for both cold and heat, protecting life and calming sudden seizures, managing acute and chronic issues together. Embracing the dragon addresses sudden wind and resolves phlegm fire; clarity dispels transformations, dispersing wind and cold. Good for the spleen and treating malaria, especially for those with chronic complications; cardamom stops diarrhea, while those with long-term leaks balance the root. White Atractylodes cures thirst due to deficiency, while cloves are a miraculous remedy for parasitic accumulation. Five colors expel internal heat, three saints clear phlegm obstructing the diaphragm. For sores of the mouth and tongue, cleanse the heart; for acute pain in the chest and ribs, control the saliva. Ginseng and Poria nourish children; do not neglect those with severe spleen deficiency; Rehmannia supplements the kidneys, beneficial for those with weak constitution. </p>
<p>Ah! Infants are fragile; how can they withstand harsh medications? Skilled practitioners of medicine especially value precision and specialization. Whether supplementing or purging, treatment should be immediately halted in case of wrong conditions; it’s easy to shift between deficiency and excess, so one must not offend the signs. If the treatment is not in accordance with the prescription, it is like trying to save someone drowning while also being burned; if the medicine does not match the illness, it is like wielding a sword unsafely. Reveal the secrets of my heart, seeking a rabbit to set a trap; gaining the benefits of this technique, do not forget the net when catching fish.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Wealth and Poverty, Different Ailments</strong></p>
<p>There is a saying among people: the children of the rich who are often sick have clear vital energies and thin bodies, and they tend to be overindulged in warmth and food. In contrast, the children of the poor who are seldom sick have turbid vital energies and robust bodies, often enduring hunger and cold. A truly wise physician understands this principle, observing the parents to discern the thickness or thinness of their vital energies, and examining appearance to know the fullness or emptiness of the organs. Harsh or vigorous medicines should not be carelessly applied, nor should gentle remedies be used indiscriminately. The song says: &quot;A physician who does not cling to conventions is a true master, capable of understanding the differences between wealth and poverty.&quot; From birth, vital energies are divided into clear and turbid; residing in different circumstances, they also change accordingly.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Diseases of Infancy: Foetal Disorders, Food Accumulation, and External Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>Infants often initially suffer from foetal disorders, and excessive eating leads to food accumulation. These two aspects serve as a framework for further discussion. </p>
<p>Diseases in infants, such as smallpox, measles, umbilical wind, eruptions, jaundice, parasitic infections, convulsions, and conditions characterized by weakness, are all considered foetal disorders. In contrast, conditions like vomiting, diarrhea, malaria, swelling, food accumulation, and malnutrition are due to food injury. Only fever and cough, or cases involving external pathogens of wind and cold, are exceptions. Thus, it is said: among infants, 40% of illnesses are due to foetal toxins, 50% due to food injury, and 10-12% due to external pathogens. </p>
<p>Seizures and convulsions arise from an excess in the liver, while the spleen is often insufficient, leading to malnutrition. A lack of development indicates a weakness in the kidneys, and skilled physicians should be mindful of these initial signs. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, infants are characterized by an insufficient spleen and an excess in the liver. The kidneys are primarily weak and also insufficient. Therefore, in discussing infantile diseases, seizures are related to the liver, malnutrition to the spleen, and insufficient foetal energy to the kidneys. A skilled physician must first understand the underlying conditions to prevent illness, hence the saying: “Do not treat existing diseases; treat latent ones.”<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>Three Traditional Methods of Treating Children</strong></p>
<p>The three family methods save children; for seizures, one must use the &quot;Embrace the Dragon&quot; technique. When the constitution is weak, it is appropriate to strengthen the kidneys, and for fat children with chronic diseases, there is remarkable efficacy. </p>
<p>To treat seizures, use the &quot;Amber Embrace the Dragon Pill,&quot; for dysentery use the &quot;Fat Child Pill,&quot; and for insufficient prenatal constitution use the &quot;Kidney-Replenishing Rehmannia Pill.&quot; These three formulas have been passed down through generations, respected and upheld by descendants.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Longevity from Premature Death</strong></p>
<p>Expert knowledge in pediatrics is essential; understanding longevity and premature death is crucial. Observing the color and pulse reveals the condition of the five organs, allowing one to use tonics and purgatives effectively. </p>
<p>As the ancient saying goes: &quot;Three bends of the indeed is a good doctor,&quot; indicating that experience is key. Therefore, a specialist in pediatrics can recognize a child’s potential for longevity or premature death at a glance. If a condition is beyond cure, it will remain uncured. When faced with sickness, observing the form and color allows diagnosis of the five organs, leading to appropriate treatment with tonics or purgatives, revealing remarkable insights.</p>
<p>It is particularly challenging to understand a child’s potential longevity; it relies on a skilled practitioner’s keen eye. Adequate form and energy indicate a propensity for longevity, while deficiency suggests premature death. A child’s life derives its energy from the father and its form from the mother. If both parents are robust, the child’s form and energy are abundant; if both are weak, the child’s form and energy are deficient. If the father is strong and the mother weak, energy may be abundant while form is lacking; conversely, if the father is weak and the mother strong, form may be sufficient while energy is lacking.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>Generally, lifespan, fortune, intelligence, and foolishness are all predetermined; how can one escape this? The attributes of a child rely entirely on the residual energy from their parents for their physical growth; thus, a fat child cannot be born from thin parents, nor can a thin child be born from fat parents. If the child&#39;s traits do not align with those of the parents, it becomes difficult to nurture them. Although there may be many issues in their early life, if their physique is appropriate, they tend to have a longer lifespan. A child with a relaxed face and slow head movements, requiring some effort to shape, is a sign of longevity. However, a child who intuitively understands others&#39; intentions, while physically weak and light, is difficult to nurture. The ancients said that like an early-blooming plum flower, which does not witness the cold of the year, or a late-blooming chrysanthemum, which thrives at the end of the year, one knows that late bloomers are a sign of longevity. If a child has a small, dark complexion that is proportionate to their body, they can be nurtured. If the child has a large, pale complexion, it is difficult to nurture them. If a child&#39;s physique is weak, the face has many pale spots, and they seem lethargic, they are hard to foster. Conversely, a child who is robust, with bright eyes, a healthy spirit, glossy skin, and good complexion shows signs of longevity. If a child&#39;s spirit is strong, they tend to suffer from fewer illnesses, making them easier to raise. However, if they appear worn and are frequently ill, they are difficult to nurture. A child with fewer dark pupils and more white in their eyes, along with a pale complexion, is not a sign of longevity, for even if they grow, they may not reach old age. If a child has large dark pupils and fewer whites, with a dark complexion that is rich and full, one should also observe the clarity of the black and white in their eyes; if they are balanced, this is a sign of health and longevity. If the dark pupils are unstable and shine brightly, even if they grow, they are expected to have eye ailments and may not live to their forties. Their head is round, the back is thick, the abdomen is like a droop, the eyes are elegant, the eyebrows are clear, and the nose is straight and proportionate.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>The earlobes are distinct, and the mouth is square; the kidneys are robust, and the flesh is plump. The head is the sea of marrow, and the kidneys govern the bone marrow; if the head is round, then the kidneys are ample. The back is where the five organs are attached; if the back is thick, then the five organs are stable. The abdomen is the sea of food and water; if the abdomen is large, then food and water are abundant. The eyes are the orifice of the liver, the ears are the orifice of the kidneys, the nose is the orifice of the lungs, the mouth is the orifice of the spleen; if all seven orifices are intact, then the form is complete. The spleen governs flesh; if the flesh is solid, then the qi of the spleen is sufficient. The liver governs tendons; if the tendons are strong, then the qi of the liver is sufficient. The kidneys govern the bones; if the bone qi is strong, then the kidneys are robust.</p>
<p>The cheeks are beautiful, the complexion reddish; the urination and defecation are harmonized and the internal qi is stable. The feet are strong, the neck is robust, and the scrotum is tight; the skin is warm and moist, and the complexion is rosy and fresh. </p>
<p>The cheeks are beautiful like a peach, the hair black like lacquer; this indicates a solid exterior. Long urination and moist defecation indicate solid internals. The feet support the body; if the support is strong and robust, the body will not bend. The neck is the stalk of the head; if the neck is long and thick, the head will not tilt. The scrotum is the convergence of the vital tendons; if it is black and small like a lychee, it indicates longevity. The flesh is the dwelling of vitality and defense; if it is warm, moist, and rosy, then vitality and defense are unblocked, and the qi and blood are adequate.</p>
<p>In essence, remain calm and peaceful, appearing almost foolish; naturally, your spirit will shine differently from others. Joy leads to laughter; do not cry too much; when it is time to sleep, let go of all thoughts.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>The bright essence does not reveal itself, the spirit is hidden within; this is not the appearance of an extraordinary child. The heart governs laughter; those who do not laugh frivolously have ample heart energy. The lungs govern weeping; those who do not weep excessively have sufficient lung energy. Additionally, a continuous, unending weeping indicates strong lung energy. The spleen governs sleep; those who do not sleep for long have sufficient spleen energy. The above three points are all signs of longevity, indicating a child who is healthy and easy to nurture.</p>
<p>With a head that is cracked and an exposed countenance, a dry nose and shriveled lips, with sparse hair, a soft neck, and thin legs, the entire face shows signs of mottled blue and purple veins. </p>
<p>All yang energies converge in the head; if the head is cracked, the yang is weakened. All yin energies arise from the feet; weak calves indicate that the yin is diminished. The nose is the aperture of the lungs; a dry nose signifies weakened lung energy. The lips and mouth are the apertures of the spleen; if the lips are shriveled and the mouth waters, the spleen energy is weak. Hair represents the surplus blood; sparse hair indicates weakened blood. The neck serves as the heavenly pillar; if the neck is soft, the pillar is bent. The blue and purple veins are signs of wind and heat; visibly scattered across the face, they can lead to ailments like fright-induced convulsions.</p>
<p>The body is emaciated, the color is pale, lacking vitality, the abdomen is large, and the veins are prominent alongside frequent bowel movements. The presence of skin lesions leads to constant crying, while joy in conversation seems forced.</p>
<p>An emaciated and pale appearance signifies external deficiency. Frequent bowel movements without cause indicate internal deficiency. Crying due to skin sores and forced laughter point to excessive movement of yang fire. These twelve points all indicate weaknesses, suggesting children prone to ailments and difficult to nourish.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br><strong>Differentiating Appearance and Color</strong></p>
<p>When a child is ill, observe their appearance and color: a blue hue indicates a shock from wind, red suggests heat, yellow implies food injury, and white indicates malnutrition. If affected by evil influences, the face will appear black. The liver governs wind, and its color is blue; the heart governs heat, and its color is red; the spleen governs grains, and its color is yellow. White represents a deficiency in qi and blood in the face, hence it suggests malnutrition. Black is an ominous color, indicating the influence of evil.</p>
<p>The complexion should be observed according to different regions: the heart influences the forehead, producing a red fiery glow; the left cheek corresponds to wood (liver), while the right cheek relates to metal (lung); the chin signifies the kidneys and the nose relates to the spleen. </p>
<p>These five forms correspond to their respective locations: the liver belongs to wood and the east, thus it is observed on the left cheek. The lung is associated with metal and the west, therefore it is checked on the right cheek. The heart pertains to fire and the south, hence it is examined on the forehead. The kidneys relate to water and the north, thus observed at the chin. The spleen corresponds to earth and the center, hence assessed at the nose.</p>
<p>Liver illnesses should be observed in the eyes, while the spleen and heart connect through the lips and tongue. Lung issues often appear in the nose, and kidney problems are discerned from the ears. </p>
<p>This relates the five openings to the five organs. Liver disease manifests in the eyes, heart disease appears on the tongue, spleen disease is visible on the lips, lung disease is apparent in the nose, and kidney disease can be seen in the ears, each determined by cold or heat, deficiency or excess. </p>
<p>If the eyes are raised and the face is red and hot, it signifies wind; furrowed brows and groaning indicate abdominal pain. A yellow swollen face may suggest a spleen condition, while sparse hair and a pale face may imply parasitic infestation.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>The liver governs wind; when the eyes are bright, it indicates liver disease. Brightness means clear vision. The heart governs heat; when the face is red, it indicates heart disease. When wind and heat interact, it will surely cause convulsions. When a person is in pain, their brow furrows and they moan. A saying goes: with dysentery, the brow furrows, and there is pain in the intestines. The spleen governs dampness; when dampness prevails, there will be swelling, and if the face is swollen and yellow, it indicates spleen disease. Accumulation of undigested food leads to chronic issues. Malnutrition is a disease of insufficient fluids. Sparse hair and a pale face indicate blood deficiency. Malnutrition often leads to parasites.</p>
<p>In cases of diarrhea, one should be wary if the complexion is fair; if the face is red due to sudden wind, that is also concerning. A pale face with cough indicates true color; blue around the lips and bluish veins signify issues. A saying states: if diarrhea is unpredictable but the spirit is good, it leads to death. If the face is as red as vermilion with wind illness, it signifies death. Persistent cough with a pale face reveals the true color of the lung.</p>
<p>For children, health and life are sought in the palace of fate, indicated by the three lines on the index finger at the tiger&#39;s mouth. To know life and death without error, one must not stray from recognizing the five colors clearly. </p>
<p>The palace of fate refers to the root of the mountain. If a child&#39;s mountain root is severed, with bluish, red, purple, and black veins crossing, they will have many difficulties and be hard to nurture. According to physiognomy, if the mountain root is blue, frequent disasters at birth are expected. Men have the left side; women the right side. If the horizontal lines on the fingers curve inward, the illness is internal; if they curve outward, the illness is external. If the lower line is larger than the upper one, it is auspicious; if the upper is larger than the lower, it is ominous.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>Differentiating Pulse and Breath</strong></p>
<p>For young children, their innate vital energy is still intact, so a pulse felt under the fingers should be strong. A large and slippery pulse that is numerous is most desirable, while a fine, thin, and slow pulse indicates deficiency, which is never auspicious. A large pulse indicates sufficient energy; a slippery pulse indicates strong blood. Six beats per breath signify a strong pulse, representative of an abundance. Conversely, a thin pulse signifies energy deficiency, and a weak pulse indicates blood deficiency. A pulse that reaches three beats on inhalation is considered slow and deficient, lacking strength; these are signs of insufficiency.</p>
<p>In assessing children&#39;s lifespans, this method of differentiation is used. A pulse that is six beats per breath indicates harmony; the notion of eight beats should not be relied upon. Four beats or less signify a state of deficiency and cold, while eight, nine, or ten beats indicate heat, leading to agitation.</p>
<p>A child&#39;s pulse typically corresponds to one breath with three beats on inhalation and three beats on exhalation, collectively termed &quot;one breath.&quot; Six beats per breath represent a harmonious and healthy pulse. The rule states: do not rely on eight beats as a sign of balance. Four beats per breath are termed &quot;leaving the canonical,&quot; while three beats or fewer denote &quot;diminished pulse,&quot; associated with cold, imbalanced conditions. Conversely, eight beats per breath signify “leaving the canonical,” while nine beats and above indicate a &quot;full pulse,&quot; linked to excess heat and convulsions.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p>
<h3>Differentiating Pulses and Treating Symptoms</h3>
<p>The foremost physician must understand both complexion and pulse thoroughly; the treatment of deficiency and excess must be applied according to the method. If there is one deviation, it will not be effective, leading to calamity for the child and transgressing heavenly laws. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: being able to unify color and pulse ensures complete well-being. The highest physician treats children by correlating color with pulse and pulse with color; if it is excess, treat with purgatives; if it is deficiency, treat with tonics; if it does not deviate, then regulate it — this is the path to complete health.</p>
<p>For instance, if the cheeks are red, it indicates excess color; if the pulse is rapid and forceful, it indicates excess pulse; constipation with yellow urine, unquenchable thirst, rapid breathing, and heat in the legs all signify an excess condition. When these three signs of excess are present, cold and cooling medicines should be used to purge. There are seven situations wherein warm medicine should not be administered.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the face appears pale, it indicates deficient color; if the pulse is weak and deep, it indicates deficient pulse; bluish stools, abdominal distention, spitting up milk, blue scleras, and coldness in the legs indicate deficiency. When these three signs of deficiency are present, warm and nourishing medicines should be used to tonify. There are seven situations wherein cold medicine should not be administered. </p>
<p>Currently, inexperienced practitioners know nothing of color, pulse, and symptom treatment, carelessly concocting decoctions and pills, endangering children&#39;s lives, and the heavens will surely punish such actions. Medicines must correspond accurately to the symptoms without error, and the condition must not exceed moderation. Wait until the true qi returns fully and nourishment is sufficient to support recovery.</p>
<p>This is what is meant by the essential techniques in treating illnesses.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>In treating conditions based on color and pulse, one must understand these principles in the heart: thus, cold conditions are treated with heat, and hot conditions with cold. In reality, for excess conditions, one drains, and for deficiency conditions, one supplements; all are methods and remedies to control disease. After taking medicine, if the illness has already diminished, one should not exceed the prescribed dosage. This aligns with the teachings from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; which states that for severe toxicity, one should reduce the treatment by a third; for moderate toxicity, reduce by half; and for non-toxic conditions, reduce by seven tenths. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; also states that when a condition is waning, one should wait for its recovery, meaning when the illness has diminished by half, one should stop the medication to allow the true vital energy to recover, supplemented by nourishing food to aid this recovery. It is said in a proverb that food supplements are preferable to medicinal supplements—a truth that coarse practitioners fail to understand. They attack cold with heat, causing internal heat to arise before the cold has dissipated; they counter heat with cold, allowing cold to set in before the heat has subsided. How can one expect recovery? The basis of premature death certainly starts here. These treatment principles are what I strictly adhere to in practice.</p>
<p>When prescribing for children, one must choose only the finest remedies, for even the slightest toxic substance is unacceptable. If pathogenic energy has not been eliminated and vital energy is depleted, it is pitiful how fragile young sprouts cannot withstand frost. </p>
<p>The &quot;fine&quot; refers to medicines that are mild, balanced, and non-toxic, while &quot;toxic&quot; refers to harsh and caustic medicines that may cause dizziness or impairment. Therefore, remedies for children should actually drain excess, such as those that clear the green bile, guide out the red bile, drain the white bile, or eliminate the yellow bile; if deficient, one should supplement, such as tranquilizing with substances like antler gelatin or rehmannia. Remedies that cool heat, regulate cold, treat convulsions, or nourish children to combat malnutrition are all gentle and non-toxic, and these are my family&#39;s secret formulas. While substances like croton and morning glory are not never used, I am cautious and do not resort to them as primary remedies.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>I see that those who practice pediatrics today use various toxic medicines: sulfur to treat phlegm, arsenic for malaria, and other powerful substances. These are highly toxic drugs, and children&#39;s digestive systems are delicate; how can they withstand such poisons? </p>
<p>When treating children, do not lightly induce sweating, as genuine conditions will be harmed. Mistaking the treatment for cold and heat can lead to excessive harm, while warming the middle and detoxifying can provide miraculous effects. </p>
<p>According to Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s principles for treating cold damage: when one should not sweat but is made to sweat, it signifies a condition of rash with excessive sweating; this can lead to severe outcomes. When one should not be purged but is, this indicates ailments of abdominal fullness, pain, vomiting, and uncontrollable diarrhea; excessive purging can lead to dire consequences. </p>
<p>When a child is ill, do not purge unless there is fever, sweating, or spontaneous diarrhea. Signs of distress include cold limbs, weak spirit, dry retching, and fear. </p>
<p>Symptoms like vomiting roundworms, pale face, hair loss, failure to digest food, nasal congestion, coughing, and thin phlegm indicate a troubled pulse and anxiety. If there is accumulation of waste, it is genuinely alarming. </p>
<p>If a child shows true heat, purging does no harm; they may have a flushed face, red eyes, and strong energy. The pulse feels tense, and the abdomen is hot; there may be throat pain and urine resembling broth. Hard stools, abdominal bloating, fullness in the sides, and swollen limbs, coupled with nighttime crying, may signify severe underlying issues that require treatment. </p>
<p>If a child suffers from the excessive use of cooling medicines, it can lead to weakened spleen and stomach and pain in the stomach area; warming the stomach is appropriate here. Conversely, if heat medicines have been overused, causing agitation, restlessness, vomiting, madness, or thirst, detoxification is needed first, and a drink of mung bean powder should be given.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>When a child suffers from fright, it is common to treat them with excessively warm or heating medications. There are instances where, even before the fright resolves, another heat condition emerges; others may have recovered from the illness yet develop heat symptoms, or the condition may worsen into a severe fright. When asking the patient over the days about how the condition arose and which medicines were used, detoxifying medications can be applied with effectiveness. The bean roll powder can be used for this.</p>
<p>When fever arises, if the patient is not alert, they may trust ghosts or divine spirits rather than the physician. It is unheard of that rituals by dragon wood or shamanic practices can resolve someone’s fright through animal sacrifice.</p>
<p>The classics say: those who are confused by ghosts and spirits are not worth discussing profound virtues with. Hence, there is a caution against believing in shamans while ignoring doctors. The traditions conveyed through shamanic practices are merely techniques of transforming essence and altering qi. Prayer to spirits often involves animal sacrifice, but of what benefit is that?</p>
<p>One should not speak openly of their illness; treatment requires focused intention. From the beginning, the three methods should be memorized, and care should be taken not to harm the spleen and stomach, which could lead to complications.</p>
<p>An ancient saying goes: If an illness cannot be treated, one should reveal it early, and not endure it in silence to avoid being ridiculed. This statement holds true. If the illness can be treated, one should care for the child as they would for their own. Nurturing and providing care must be thorough. There are three approaches: first, use vigorous methods to drive away the illness; one should not excessively attack while favoring supplements, as this will only aid the evil and harm the child. Second, apply a combination of vigorous and gentle methods; if the illness lingers, food intake must be limited, and the spleen and stomach weakened, so in spleen supplements, add medicinal ingredients to address the illness, adjusting according to the child’s strength. Lastly, gentle methods should be employed; if the child has been ill for a long time, it could lead to malnutrition, focusing primarily on nourishing the spleen and stomach will ensure that the right qi is strengthened, which will cause the evil qi to dissipate naturally.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 400</p>
<p>Pediatric Diagnostic Section</p>
<p>Questions and Answers for Infants and Young Children by Lu Bosi (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>Pulse Diagnosis<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>From the age of one to three, one should observe the pulse at the tigertail position, applying the finger to press the higher segments. Thus, one finger divides into three sections to determine the pulse rate. A breath count of eight indicates a normal pulse, nine indicates unease, and ten indicates a dangerous condition. Each pulse&#39;s length and size reflects various ailments. A floating pulse indicates wind, a rapid pulse suggests fright, a slow and deep pulse signifies deficiency and coldness, a strong pulse indicates heat, a tight pulse suggests convulsions, a full pulse indicates excessive heat, a deep and thin pulse suggests abdominal pain, a slow and deep pulse indicates deficiency and diarrhea, a faint and slow pulse suggests accumulation or worms, a slow and thick pulse indicates disharmony in the stomach, a deep pulse suggests difficulty in digesting milk, a deep and thin pulse suggests milk accumulation, a tight and wiry pulse indicates abdominal heat and pain, a firm pulse indicates constipation, and a deep but rapid pulse suggests internal heat in the bones. A long and wiry pulse suggests wind in the liver and diaphragm, a tight and rapid pulse indicates convulsions and spasms, a floating and full pulse indicates heat in the stomach, a deep and tight pulse suggests persistent abdominal pain, a weak and soft pulse implies a mix of energy deficiency and slow fright, and a wide pulse with frequent diarrhea indicates blood in the stool. </p>
<p>At four years old, one should use one finger to press on the fullness and emptiness; at five and six, one should roll the finger to explore the three positions, with a normalized pulse at the central spot. At seven and eight, one should slightly adjust the finger to explore the three positions. At nine and ten, one should sequentially examine the locations corresponding to the three sections. At eleven and twelve, one examines similarly to the ten-year-olds. At fourteen and fifteen, one should examine according to the larger pulse positions. </p>
<p>In all pulse examinations, one must first determine floating or deep, slow or rapid, and the balance of yin and yang, hot and cold, all in relation to the larger pulse. A deep and slow pulse represents yin, while a floating and rapid pulse represents yang. It is also essential to examine facial color: a bluish tone indicates fright, a pale tone indicates deficiency and diarrhea, a reddish tone indicates phlegm-heat, a blackish tone suggests a grave condition, and a yellow tone indicates spleen-related accumulation. Utilizing this method to analyze the symptoms will yield accurate assessments for treatment, ensuring nothing is overlooked.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>On the face, the evidence of one&#39;s health can be seen.</p>
<p>The left cheek corresponds to the liver, the right cheek to the lungs, the forehead to the heart, the nose to the spleen, and the chin to the kidneys. Red indicates heat, and one should treat according to the symptoms. This is an essential discussion by Zhong Yang. Regarding the five colors seen on the face: The blue color indicates unresolved shock; it may wish to unleash a wind condition. The fiery red color suggests a buildup of phlegm, leading to increased anxiety. The yellowish-brown color reflects digestive issues, possibly indicating the onset of illnesses like scrofula. The pale color indicates that the large intestine is leaking, disrupting the differentiation of fluids, possibly leading to vomiting and diarrhea. The black color signifies impending organ failure; the illness is severe and the child may not survive long. There is also the aspect of facial features: a bluish tint on the forehead indicates a tendency toward convulsions.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>The red dominates and brings great heat; the blue at the center of the forehead first causes shock and leads to a discharge. The red is greatly alarmed and cries out at night, while the black indicates a guest&#39;s opposition. The blue at the root of the nose leads to a second shock. Blue signifies discharge followed by agitation, and excessive black and yellow indicate death. If one’s lifespan is level and falls, it indicates premature death. Blue signifies fever and shock; black indicates dysentery leading to death, while red indicates death from dryness. A slight yellow indicates balance; excessive yellow signifies death from cholera. Pale yellow at the nasal tip suggests balance, while excessive yellow indicates death from soil disturbance, with black and red indicating extreme danger. The black at the philtrum indicates worm bites; prolonged lip reversal indicates death, while shortness indicates death from benefits. Yellow at the edges suggests gastric reflux, while blue indicates diarrhea. A healthy red mouth indicates balance with dry spleen heat; white suggests death from blood loss, while yellow suggests accumulation. Blue due to shock from wind results in death; black gas around the mouth suggests death. Blue at the chin, arising from shock during meals, indicates yellow, leading to vomiting or reflux, while red indicates bloody dysentery; red and black suggest shock from wind. Both eyes have black and yellow indicating heat; white sclera signifies undigested food causing sores or roundworms; white with blue indicates liver wind and shock, while black sclera with yellow indicates typhoid. Blue above the eyebrows is auspicious; sudden redness indicates agitation and night cries, while yellow suggests cholera and prolonged redness indicates death. The two pools of wind energy with blue indicate wind conditions; purple suggests vomiting or fever, yellow indicates reflux, and red indicates agitation with night cries. Both cheeks are red, indicating heat in the lungs; both temples with blue indicate a second shock; blue entering the ears suggests death, while red indicates bloody urination. Both sides of the face being blue indicate guest opposition; yellow suggests phlegm overflow, and red indicates wind heat. Both cheeks in red indicate typhoid; left side red suggests heart heat and mouth sores, while the right side red indicates lung heat. Yellow signifies accumulation, while red suggests bloody urination; both jaws of blue indicate vomiting of worms. Both &quot;golden stores&quot; in blue suggest a third shock leading to wind. Black around the mouth indicates death in two days; blue connecting the eyes to the ears indicates death in seven days. Both wind gates in red suggest wind heat; black indicates hernia, while blue signifies shock from water. Black entering from the eyebrows indicates death on the same day; black lips indicating refusal to eat suggests death. Additionally, a blue face with blue eyes indicates liver disease; a red face indicates heart disease; a white face suggests lung disease; a yellow face indicates spleen disease, and a black face signifies kidney disease. Each of the five organs has its own significance, and one must observe the balance of excess and deficiency, the state of the fetus, the yin and yang flow, and respond to losses. The organs face inward and outward; if one can distinguish between the superficial and the fundamental, then divine knowledge and skill can naturally be attained.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion on Pediatric Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>Children aged seven to eight are referred to as &quot;Chun,&quot; and those aged nine to ten as &quot;Tiao.&quot; At this stage, one can begin to feel the pulse at the three pulse positions behind the wrist using a single finger, with a normal pulse characterized by seven to eight beats per breath. From eleven to fourteen years old, they are called &quot;Tongcao,&quot; and a normal pulse is defined by five to six beats per breath. </p>
<p>A rapid pulse indicates heat, while a slower pulse suggests cold; a floating pulse indicates deficiency or wind, and a deep pulse points to fullness or pain. A floating and rapid pulse could signify乳癎 (a kind of childhood convulsion) or anxiety, a weak and soft pulse indicates chronic anxiety or seizures, a tight and solid pulse suggests wind convulsions, a firm and leathery pulse is connected to constipation, a deep and string-like pulse indicates food stagnation or abdominal pain, a tense and string-like pulse indicates respiratory distress due to wind-cold, and a strong and rapid pulse points to heat, while a hidden pulse implies food damage. A pulse that is chaotic, uneven, or alternates with shortness of breath signals imminent death if not treated promptly.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>Song of Manifest Symptoms</p>
<p>Dysentery furrows the brow, shock reddens the cheeks. Thirst brings red lips, poison and heat cloud the eyes.<br>If a horizontal blue vein appears at the root of the nose, one knows the illness is marked by two shocks. Red and black, suffering and fatigue, caused by vomiting and diarrhea; the color red weeps through the night without cease.<br>The blue vein arising from the left temple indicates one shock must be carefully examined. Red signals mild heat from cold damage, while black and blue indicate excess milk injury.<br>The blue vein on the right does not require much attention; if present, frequent shocks are unavoidable. Red and crimson are signs of wind affecting the eyes, while black and blue could lead to the Yama king in three days.<br>Fingernails dark with blue and black indicate heavy illness; blue lips signify severe illness hard to heal. Suddenly a crow&#39;s voice arises, the heart and spirit anxious; at this moment, life is truly at risk.<br>Three types of expulsion occur with roundworms, emerging from the mouth and nose, which is unbearable. If there are white worms along with black ones, even with miraculous medicine, the illness will be hard to settle.<br>Sore and painful limbs are not auspicious, downward energy disrupts the heart and causes slippery intestines. Shortness of breath and profuse sweating without fever, holding the chest and diaphragm surely brings misfortune.<br>In the eyes, red veins are difficult to measure, and their numbers ultimately signify bad omens. Most feared are chaotic patterns beneath the eyes, alongside red veins piercing the pupils’ light.  <a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>The swelling at the front of the jaw is surely due to wind; this condition should be known as the most harmful cause. Suddenly it sinks into a pit like the foot of a lamp; if not resolved in seven days, life must end. </p>
<p>The nostrils are dark and dry, thirst hard to endure; if the face is black and lips are blue, life cannot survive. A large abdomen with blue veins is also an ominous sign, especially if there are straight lines on the belly.</p>
<p>Suddenly a purple mark appears between the eyebrows; upon seeing it, one immediately feels the onset of wind. The mixed blue and red indicates the wind is about to arise, and it must be seen as a sign of consuming illness affecting one&#39;s Qi.</p>
<p>Confused lines cross and intertwine; one must urgently seek a doctor to avoid death. If the purple is intense and the body feels hot, one should know that internal organs are suffering from harmful wind.</p>
<p>When purple is less and red more, it terrifies livestock; if purple and red are equal, then the condition has worsened. Purple spots that feel like grains of rice indicate a combination of cold and food ailments, which warrants careful evaluation.</p>
<p>When purple spreads and influences the spleen, the deep purple and blue thirst indicates wind epilepsy. Deep hidden purples are difficult to treat; if wind-phlegm remains, life must return. </p>
<p>Light black can be treated, allowing for recovery, while bright red with cold signifies accumulation of phlegm. Red and blue in the spleen indicate wind evil signs, while blue and black in the spleen cause gradual shock.</p>
<p>The continuous red must not be treated lightly, as it surely means the nurse’s milk is unsuited. If both hands suddenly show no pulse, it is certain that maliciousness has offended the divine.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>Internal Eight Segment Brocade</strong></p>

<p>First, observe the child&#39;s eye color; next, check if the back feels cold as ice. For a male child, convulsions on the left are not a concern, but those on the right are quite alarming. For a female child, convulsions on the right can still be treated; however, if they convulse on the left, the condition is serious.<br>A crooked mouth and eyes will ultimately cause harm; even with elixirs, there is no remedy.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br><strong>Preserving Infants’ Golden Mirror Records</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagram of the Head and Face Regions</strong></p>
<p>See the image<br>[Illustration Explanation]<br>The head is where various Yang meridians converge; the face reflects the nourishment of the five organs&#39; qi and blood. Color represents the spirit of the five organs. To discern a child&#39;s illness or well-being, one must first distinguish the positions of growth and decline. When the five organs are weak, the complexion will certainly appear shriveled; when the five colors are full, the complexion will be bright. A vibrant complexion indicates life, while a withered complexion indicates death. Since observation precedes diagnosis, it is said: the ability to observe color and pulse can lead to comprehensive well-being. According to &quot;Complete Reflection on Childhood,&quot; if a child is ill within six months, one should press three fingers horizontally on the forehead, between the eyebrows and hairline. </p>
<p>When the child&#39;s head is raised on the left, use the right hand; when raised on the right, use the left hand. The index finger represents the upper area, the middle finger the middle area, and the ring finger the lower area. If all three fingers are hot, it indicates the invasion of wind pathogenic factors, with symptoms like nasal congestion, rough breathing, fever, and cough. If all three fingers are cold, it suggests external invasion and internal damage, with symptoms like fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. If the index and middle fingers are hot, it indicates heat above and cold below; if the middle finger is hot, it suggests a shock; if only the index finger is hot, it indicates fullness in the chest; if only the ring finger is hot, it suggests undigested milk or food.</p>
<p>I privately assert that a red forehead indicates heart wind heat, leading to agitation and uneasiness. If there is fever and thirst for water, or if the child cries incessantly, it pertains to real heat in the heart meridian, and one should use a cooling heart decoction to clear heart fire.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>When there is slight redness, it indicates restlessness and palpitations, with fever and thirst for tea. This is due to虚热, and one should use the secret method Anshen Pill to nourish the heart&#39;s blood. Dark bluish-black indicates shock, wind, and abdominal pain, or convulsions and crying; use the Wuwai Yigong Powder, adding Muxiang, Chaihu, and Diaoteng to tonify the spleen and liver. A pronounced dark bluish-black suggests severe heart and abdominal pain; this cold water overcomes the heart fire, representing a rebellious evil, and one should use Yihuang Powder to nourish the spleen and stomach. Slightly yellow and dry skin indicates a shocking type of dysentery, relating to heart dysentery; the secret method Anshen Pill is used to nourish the heart&#39;s blood. Bone steaming with thirst and night sweats, along with hair turning dry and yellow, indicates kidney dysentery; use Dihuang Pill to nourish the liver and kidneys.</p>
<p>A blue face, or one mixed with red, signifies liver channel wind-heat, with a stiff neck and irritability, twitching of the hair and eyes, and convulsions; use Chaihu Qinggan Powder to treat this. A slightly red color and teeth grinding indicate虚热, and one should use Dihuang Pill to supplement it. Dark blue suggests liver overcoming spleen, with cold shock, convulsions, and abdominal pain; one should use the Six Gentlemen Decoction, ginger, and cinnamon to warm it. A slight red indicates tidal fever with heart blood deficiency and restlessness; use the secret method Anshen Pill in conjunction with Dihuang Pill.</p>
<p>A red right face indicates wind evils of the lung and large intestine with real heat, causing coarse coughing and feverish thirst; use Xie Bai Powder. If there is a sensation of choking with shortness of breath and pale lips, this indicates虚热; use Wuwai Yigong Powder. If it is transmitted by spleen heat, use Qingwei Powder. If it is due to heart fire, use Ren Shen Pingfei Powder.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>A faint red signifies a dominant heat in the body, often leading to hard and constipated stools. Use the Xuanming Chaihu Decoction to disperse the heat. If the heat persists, further apply the Diaoteng Decoction to clear the liver and nourish the spleen. A blue-white coloration indicates coughing and nausea; first use the Xingsheng Powder to resolve the external邪, strengthen the spleen, and then follow up with the Liu Junzi Decoction to tonify the central qi. A deep blue-black indicates convulsions and abdominal pain, with intestinal issues; this suggests the liver wood is dominating the spleen earth. Use the Liu Junzi Decoction with added Diaoteng to tonify the original qi; do not treat the liver directly.</p>
<p>A red nose indicates excess heat in the spleen and stomach, with body heat and normal appetite; use the Xie Huang San to clear heat and regulate the spleen. A slight redness indicates a deficiency-heat in the spleen channel, leading to difficulty in digestion and loss of appetite; use the Wuwi Yigong Powder to tonify and strengthen the spleen. A deep yellow signifies difficulty in urination, dryness in the nose, coarse breath, and nosebleeds, indicating spleen heat affecting the lungs and kidneys; first apply the Jisheng Xijiao Dihuang Decoction to clear heat and nourish blood, then use the Dihuang Pill to nourish kidney water. A pale white indicates weak spleen qi, leading to diarrhea and difficulty in digesting food; use Liu Junzi for tonification. A blue coloration signifies cold in the spleen earth, with the liver wood dominating; use the Wuwi Yigong Powder, adding musk and toasted ginger to warm the middle and balance the liver. Black signifies a terminal condition.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>The area between the chin is red, indicating kidney and bladder yin deficiency with heat causing difficulty in urination. Use Si Wu Decoction added with Gardenia to nourish the blood and clear heat. If the redness is severe, it indicates bladder qi stagnation with heat accumulation; use Wu Ling Powder to disperse the evil. If the nostrils are slightly yellow and the right cheek is slightly red, this indicates spleen and lung dryness-heat, unable to transform and generate kidney water; use Huang Qin Qing Fei Decoction. If bladder yin is deficient, and yang is unable to be generated, use Zi Shen Wan. If there is slight redness in the area between the chin, it indicates bladder yang deficiency, where yin is unable to transform; use Ba Wei Di Huang Wan. If accompanied by fullness in the lower abdomen or swelling of the scrotum, this belongs to yin deficiency with damp-heat stagnation; use Liu Wei Wan added with Plantago Seed and Achyranthes. If there is also spleen and lung qi deficiency preventing proper regulation of water pathways, use the same previous formula. If the urine is red, persisting and leading to blood in the urine, this indicates liver and kidney qi deficiency with heat; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan for treatment. If that is ineffective, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish the spleen and lung, generating kidney and liver. If after urination, white fluid comes out or there is pain in the penis, this belongs to liver channel damp-heat; first use Long Dan Cao Pian to clear the liver, followed by Liu Wei Di Huang Wan.</p>
<p>If the area between the eyebrows is dark blue-black, it indicates abdominal pain and night crying, due to spleen channel deficiency and cold; the spleen is of utmost yin, hence abdominal pain and crying at night; use Diao Teng Decoction. If the color is pale white, it points to diarrhea with undigested food, indicating weak spleen qi; use Wu Wei Yi Gong San added with Muxiang for treatment.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>If the eyes appear green, it indicates wind-heat affecting the liver channel, and if the person tends to cry when looking directly, this signals excess heat in the liver channel; use He Gan San to suppress it. If there are symptoms of teeth grinding and irritability, indicating deficiency heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If the eyes are red, it signifies heat in both the heart and liver channels, leading to convulsions and restlessness; if urination is red, it reflects excess heat in the small intestine, and one should use Dao Chi San. If there are feelings of anxiety and fatigue, indicating blood deficiency in the liver channel, Liu Wei Di Huang Wan is also appropriate. </p>
<p>If the eyes are yellow, it suggests deficiency in the spleen, leading to reduced appetite and night sweats; use Si Wei Fei Er Wan. If there is stagnation in food leading to vomiting and diarrhea, use Wei Ling San with the addition of Gui Zhi, Yin Chen, and Shan Zhi. If the eyes twitch and blink due to wind heat confronting each other, first use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San, followed by Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. </p>
<p>If the eyelids are mildly swollen, it indicates chronic coughing with nausea or spleen dysfunction from food stagnation; use Wu Wei Yi Gong San to tonify the spleen and lungs, along with Fei Er Wan to dissolve accumulations. If there is unclear vision or if one rubs the eyes excessively, it suggests a desire for wind; quickly apply He Gan San to relieve it. If there are red threads at the corners of the eyes, it indicates liver wood overpowering spleen earth; first employ Si Jun Zi with Chai Hu and Shan Zhi, then follow up with Di Huang Wan.</p>
<p>If the complexion appears yellow, it suggests injury to the stomach from food stagnation; if green, it indicates diarrhea with undigested milk and food, resulting in sour belching, which is due to spleen deficiency and stagnation; use Ping Wei San to resolve the accumulation and harmonize the middle.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>The color blue and red indicates fright, with liver qi injuring the spleen. Use Wuwei Yigong Powder with Chai Hu to calm the liver and tonify the center. Black indicates pain from roundworms. </p>
<p>Pale lips indicate spitting of saliva and vomiting, or even blood from vomiting and stools, which is due to weak spleen qi unable to govern saliva and blood source. Urgently use Liu Junzi Decoction to tonify the middle qi, and all ailments will self-resolve; avoid cool medicines. If the lips are red, dry, and wrinkled, it indicates heat in the spleen meridian, causing fever and thirst, foul breath, constipation, and irritability leading to insomnia. First treat the heat with Qingwei Powder, and further use Liu Junzi Decoction with Huang Lian and Shan Zhi to supplement the spleen. </p>
<p>A yellow color indicates food stagnation and diarrhea in the spleen meridian, where food doesn’t digest; use Liu Junzi Decoction to warm and tonify the middle qi. If the color is red and white, it suggests epistaxis, resulting from deficiency heat in the spleen and lungs unable to govern blood. Use Sheng Ji Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction to clear heat and nourish blood, combining it with Liu Junzi to supplement spleen qi. If there is no improvement after a long time, use Mai Men Dong San, or Ren Shen Bu Fei Decoction, or Ren Shen An Wei Powder.</p>
<p>Yellow at the mouth indicates heat accumulation in the spleen meridian; use Qingwei Powder to regulate the spleen and clear heat. For prolonged illness, use Si Wei Fei Er Wan to treat summer heat. If the lips and mouth spasm, indicating fright heat and restlessness, use Wuwei Yigong Powder with Shan Zhi and Diaoteng Gou to tonify the spleen and calm the liver. If there is drooling and the lips are purple, it indicates weak cold stomach qi; use Yi Huang San.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>If there is pain in the abdomen accompanied by spitting saliva, it is due to worms. First, use Wuyi Powder, then follow with Tiaozhong Pill. If there is no salivation, the pain is due to accumulation; simply use Wuwai Yigong Powder to nourish the stomach qi. If the hands and feet are cold, use Lichong Decoction with dried plum to warm and nourish the middle qi, so that the worms will not move and the pain will stop. There are also cases of accumulation pain where vomiting or bowel movement can relieve the pain; for these, use Xiaojiyuan Pill to eliminate and guide away the stagnant accumulation, supplemented with Yigong Powder to nourish the stomach qi. White indicates loss of blood, leading to death. Blue indicates wind stroke, leading to death. Black around the mouth indicates no treatment can be effective.</p>
<p>A slight redness in front of the ear indicates wind-heat in the Shaoyang channel; use Chaihu and Zhizi Powder to nourish liver blood and clear liver fire. A mild yellow indicates night terrors during sleep and teeth grinding due to the deficiency of liver and spleen heat; the use of the Four Gentlemen Decoction with Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Schizonepeta is recommended to calm the spirit. </p>
<p>If the ear lobes are dry, it indicates steaming heat from bone sores, which is due to deficiency heat in the kidney channel; use Liuwuwei Dihuang Pill to replenish this. If there is discharge of white fluid after urination or itching and pain of the penis, it indicates liver channel damp-heat; first use Longdan Cao Decoction, then follow with Liuwuwei Dihuang Pill. If there is insufficient kidney qi from constitution or early exposure to women causing urinary stagnation or pain like dysuria, urgently use Liuwuwei Dihuang Pill and Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to nourish the source of transformation.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>If there is pain associated with urination or defecation, it is particularly a sign of deficiency. One should use the previously mentioned medicine, adding Achyranthes bidentata, Plantago seeds, and cinnamon to alleviate it. If hands and feet are cold and there is fear of cold and reduced appetite, it indicates a deficiency of Yang energy and coldness; therefore, one should urgently add a larger dosage of Aconite root if there is vitality. Generally, in children&#39;s cases, many arise from inherent imbalances in the organs, improper food and season, or from the six excesses and seven emotions impacting pregnant women and nursing mothers. </p>
<p>If initially, the vital energy is not depleted, and food intake is normal, yet there is high fever, constipation, thirst for water, and sleeping with eyes open, this indicates substantial illness and requires treatment for the pathogenic qi. If the condition has persisted, with diminished vital energy, reduced food intake, fever, dry mouth, vomiting, diarrhea, cold intolerance in limbs, and sleeping with eyes open, this indicates a substantial illness due to deficiency, and one should tonify the vital qi. </p>
<p>Moreover, the vital energy in today&#39;s children differs from that of the past; inappropriate medication can harm the spleen and stomach, so one cannot simply adhere to ancient prescriptions in treatment. Therefore, I have referred to renowned experts and followed the teachings of the Eastern Garden, supplementing with appropriate prescriptions for various symptoms. A practitioner ought to observe the patient’s complexion to assess their condition, examine the illness to strengthen the root, and this will yield no mistakes. Thus, in ancient medicine, checking the complexion was paramount. Furthermore, when startled, the qi disperses and the pulse becomes disordered, so one cannot focus solely on diagnosis and must also examine the complexion. The &quot;Heart Mirror&quot; states: if the facial color is incomplete, one should also consult the pulse; if the pulse is incomplete, one should look at the facial color; when both color and pulse are fully evaluated, there remains no hidden condition.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br><strong>Summary of Infant Protection</strong><br><strong>[Ming - Xue Kai]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facial Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>A blue complexion indicates lingering fright that has not dispersed, signaling a potential wind condition. Red denotes phlegm accumulation and anxiety. Yellow suggests food stagnation affecting the body, indicating the onset of intestinal ailments. A pale complexion points to diarrhea from food and drink, possibly leading to vomiting. Black signifies a critical condition of the internal organs. A blue area on the glabella (the space between the eyebrows) denotes initial fright-induced diarrhea; red indicates severe fright with night crying, while black suggests an obstructive issue. Blue at the root of the nose signifies a second bout of fright; increased agitation after diarrhea indicates serious condition; significant black and yellow may lead to death. A flat lifespan line suggests potential early death; blue signifies heat-induced fright, black indicates a fatal outcome, red suggests restlessness leading to death, subtle yellow indicates stability, while prominent yellow signifies cholera. </p>
<p>A blue tint at the承浆 (the area below the lower lip) signifies fright during feeding; yellow indicates vomiting and also points to blood in stools; black indicates wind-induced fright. Yellow in the whites of the eyes signifies heat; yellow in the blue of the eyes denotes food stagnation and intestinal worms; blue in the whites indicates fright-induced convulsions; yellow in the blue of the eyes signifies typhus. </p>
<p>A blue mark above the eyebrows is auspicious; sudden red indicates restlessness and night crying, while yellow may suggest cholera, and prolonged redness may be fatal. </p>
<p>Wind conditions may appear in the two pools (areas near the eyes); blue indicates a wind condition, purple may signal vomiting or fever, yellow indicates vomiting, and red indicates restlessness and night crying. </p>
<p>Red cheeks denote possible lung heat. Blue at the temples suggests a second incidence of fright; if the blue spreads from the temples to the ears, it may result in death; red indicates blood in urine. </p>
<p>Blue on both sides of the face points to an obstructive issue, yellow denotes phlegm overflow, and red signifies wind heat. </p>
<p>Both red cheeks suggest typhus, while blue at the mandibles indicates potential worm infestation.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>The two golden urns indicate that when the blue leader suffers from a sudden wind three times, the black leader (causing) throat issues will lead to death in two days, while the blue (one) entering the ears will die in seven days. The two wind doors indicate that the red leader, who suffers from wind-heat, the black (one) leads to hernia, the blue (one) indicates water shock, and the black enters the ears from the eyebrows, causing death on the same day. Those with black lips and cannot eat will die.</p>
<p>Pulse Forms</p>
<p>The &quot;flowing pearl&quot; shape indicates injury from food, internal heat wanting to vomit, or gurgling intestines with diarrhea, irritability, and crying. Use gastric paste to mitigate food effects, separating yin and yang; if digestion occurs but illness persists, use fragrant sand to help gastric paste to tonify the spleen and stomach. The &quot;ringed pearl&quot; shape indicates spleen deficiency with food stagnation, fullness and congestion in the chest, and thirst with fever. Use the modified Five Flavors Essence Powder with mountain pear and bitter orange to strengthen the spleen and aid digestion, followed by Six Gentlemen Decoction to nourish the central qi. The &quot;long pearl&quot; shape indicates spleen injury, food accumulation, abdominal pain, intolerance of cold and heat, and inability to eat. First, use Great Tranquility Pills to resolve accumulation, followed by Essence Powder to strengthen spleen qi. The &quot;coming snake&quot; shape indicates damp-heat in the spleen and stomach, blockage in the middle section, dry retching, and inability to eat. This is an internal evil of malnutrition; first, use the Four Flavor Fat Child Pills to treat malnutrition, followed by Four Gentlemen Decoction to tonify the spleen. The &quot;going snake&quot; shape indicates spleen deficiency with food accumulation, vomiting, diarrhea, thirst, shortness of breath, anxiety, inability to eat, and fatigue. First, use Six Gentlemen Decoction with bitter orange to strengthen the spleen and resolve accumulation, followed by Seven Flavor Atractylodes Powder to nourish the stomach qi.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>The bow-shaped condition indicates a cold invasion causing symptoms such as chills, difficulty breathing, anxiety, fatigue, cold extremities, red urine, cough with phlegm. First, use the Xingxing Powder to enhance stomach qi and expel external pathogens, then add Wuwei Yigong Powder with Poria and Angelica to nourish heart blood and support stomach qi. If the external pathogen is resolved but anxiety and cold fingers persist, it indicates spleen qi injury; in this case, use Qiwwei Baizhu Powder for supplementation. If there are severe issues like breathlessness and difficulty breathing, it may be difficult to treat due to significant spleen deficiency.</p>
<p>The outward bow shape suggests phlegm-heat causing confusion of the mind, with mix-ups from fright and food. For excessive phlegm from wind and spasms, start with Tianma Fangfeng Pills to eliminate external pathogens, and then use Wuwei Yigong Powder to regulate middle qi.</p>
<p>The spear shape indicates wind-heat generating phlegm and convulsions. Start with Baolong Pills; if ineffective, use Niu Huang Qingxin Pills. If it progresses to the spleen and lungs or if wind-phlegm medications are misused, focus on supplementing the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>The fish bone shape signifies driving phlegm and generating heat; begin with Baolong Pills for treatment. If ineffective, it relates to excessive liver fire, thus use a small amount of Yizhi Qing Pills to clear the liver, while continuing with Liuwei Pills to nourish the liver.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>When there is a fever and loss of appetite, or excessive phlegm causing convulsions, this indicates that the wood of the liver overcomes the earth of the spleen. Use the Six Gentlemen Decoction combined with Radix Bupleuri to tonify the spleen&#39;s earth and restrain the liver&#39;s wood. </p>
<p>The water shape corresponds to wind fright and food accumulation, with chest oppression, irritability, and reduced appetite, or nighttime crying with excessive phlegm, and closed mouth with convulsions. This reflects weakness of the spleen and stomach, with food stagnation and the wood overcoming the earth. First, use the Great Tranquility Pill to transform and guide food, followed by the Six Gentlemen Decoction and vine hook to strengthen the middle and clear the liver. If these are taken and the condition does not improve, then combine Four Gentlemen, Radix Cimicifugae, Bupleurum, and vine hook to bolster spleen qi and pacify the liver wood.</p>
<p>For the needle shape, this addresses extreme heart and liver heat generating wind, with palpitations and irritability, drowsiness and loss of appetite, and phlegm causing convulsions. Start with the Bao Long Pill to expel wind and transform phlegm, and then use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with vine hook to calm the liver and strengthen the spleen.</p>
<p>The piercing finger shape indicates wind fright with phlegm-heat gathering in the chest and diaphragm, which arises from damage to the spleen and lungs, allowing phlegm evil to accumulate. Begin with the Niu Huang Qing Xin Pill to clear the spleen and lungs and transform phlegm; then follow with the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding Platycodon and Dioscorea to tonify the spleen&#39;s earth and nourish the lung&#39;s metal.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>Through the analysis of the condition, the primary concern is the wind attacking the liver, which can overpower the spleen&#39;s earth. In urgent cases, use Six Gentlemen, Mu Xiang, Diaoteng Gou, and Guang Gui to warm and tonify the spleen. If there is no response, add Fu Zi to revive the Yang Qi, which often helps those who are seriously ill.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve heard ancient people say: children are like young sprouts, soft like grass shoots or water&#39;s soak. This is because their organs are fragile, and they cannot express themselves, making medication difficult to administer. One should first observe the complexion to understand the condition, and then check the tiger&#39;s mouth to discern its cause—this is a concise approach to treatment.</p>
<p>Note: The flowing beads show just a point of red; the ring beads differ in size, and the long beads are oval and elongated. The above does not refer to loops, but rather to the red veins penetrating the Qi. Coming snake is like long bead scatter, with one end thick and the other sharp. The departing snake is the same. The distinction of upper and lower aspects leads to their naming. The horn bow bent outward shows repression, while inward indicates smoothness. The spear shape points straight up, the fishbone diverges, and the water character symbolizes the simultaneous flow of three pulses. The needle shape indicates a pass with a few grains of rice, with the penetrating meridian directed outward while the life meridian curves in. However, I have also treated conditions without exclusively focusing on their shapes and pulses—there are cases where specific treatments with particular medications have yielded good results.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Guide</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Gong Xin)</p>
<p><strong>Singing of Illness Indicated by the Color of Children&#39;s Three Passages</strong></p>
<p>Purple indicates heat and red signifies cold damage; blue signals fright and white suggests malnutrition. Black appears due to internal evils, while yellow indicates obstruction in the spleen.<br>Blue color indicates growth abnormalities with fright affecting all four limbs; red color signifies growth anomalies influenced by water, fire, and birds.<br>Purple color indicates harm to grains, flour, fish, and meat. Black color suggests slight wind from the spleen causing convulsions.<br><strong>Song of Variations in the Three Passages&#39; Pulse Patterns</strong><a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>The presence of fishbone causing wind syndrome should not be doubted; it is accompanied by qi-related illness and heat. When the life gate shows this, it is difficult to treat, as it indicates a transition from the liver to the spleen. </p>
<p>Initially, the suspended needle can lead to dysentery; the qi gate shows lung heat further aggravating the illness. When the three gates are directly linked to the underworld, it is important to recognize this as a chronic fright. </p>
<p>Water-related fright indicates the lungs have received wind; the qi gate experiences wheezing and cough with accumulated phlegm. Physicians should carefully analyze the deficiencies and excesses; the onset of fright viewed alongside this illness is ominous. </p>
<p>The character &#39;乙&#39; represents fright affecting the liver and lungs; the qi gate manifests with sudden emergencies. If this form appears directly at the life gate, it won&#39;t take long to develop into a chronic spleen issue. </p>
<p>The curled worm indicates the onset of illness; if the qi gate shows stagnant toxins in the liver. Once it reaches the life gate, it is untreatable, and one must know that the heart has transmitted to the liver. </p>
<p>When double rings indicate deep liver illness, vomiting and nausea arise from the gastric qi gate. If the life gate shows signs of imminent death, it’s futile for physicians to exhaust their efforts. </p>
<p>When flowing pearls are seen, death approaches; even if the face looks like this, the person will not survive. Though there may be miraculous pills, no one can save them. Physicians must still be meticulous and attentive. </p>
<p>In cases of typhoid, the inclination is to the right; for food injury, seven should be cautious. If there&#39;s cold injury, it is determined; when startled, mountain-shaped signs appear. If the thread-like pattern emerges, the abundant shape leads to worry. If one encounters wind syndrome, the pulse tilts to the left. </p>
<p>The form resembles a crescent moon, feeling left within qi and heat distress. If it bends to the left, wind and heat medicines can be used. Forms like three folds indicate an enmity with solid objects. Additional rings forming the legs especially distrust the upper and lower hooks. </p>
<p>All these are signs of cold injuries; physicians should diligently seek to understand. A severe illness resembles exhaustion; all kinds of worms can be a concern. With entangled and overlapping lines, conditions on the abdomen reveal the source. </p>
<p>Moreover, visible blue veins cutting through indicate there is an extremely low chance of recovery.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis Verse</strong></p>
<p>When a child is ill, rely on the pulse; one finger on three positions determines the breath. Slow and cold, or fast and hot, passed down through the ages. Floating, windy, sinking, and stagnant, recognize these first. The left hand at the &quot;Renying&quot; indicates external symptoms, while the right at &quot;Qikou&quot; points to internal diseases. Observe for invasion of wind, cold, heat, and dampness from the outside; from the inside, consider milk, food, phlegm, and accumulation. A large and tight pulse indicates harm from cold; a floating and soft pulse with sweat suggests a cold wind. A floating and full pulse often indicates excess of wind-heat, while a sinking and thin pulse is due to accumulation of milk and food. A tight and sinking pulse with persistent abdominal pain; a wiry and tight pulse indicates breathlessness in the throat. A tight pulse can give rise to rashes and boils, while a rapid pulse may lead to convulsions. A soft and thin pulse suggests parasites, while a firm and solid pulse indicates constipation. A flooding pulse shows blood in the stool, and a weak, moist pulse accompanies anxiety. A slippery pulse indicates injury from exposure to dampness and cold. A tense and rapid pulse must be noted for its adverse effects. Discrepancies in size indicate critical conditions; two beats indicate collapse, three indicate sudden fatality. Five signifies deficiency, four indicates harm, while six, balanced and harmonious, implies no illness. Seven and eight reflect milder conditions, nine and ten indicate severity. Eleven and twelve pulses confirm inevitable death; this principle is rarely wrong.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis Song</strong></p>
<p>Children&#39;s index fingers differentiate three positions, with boys on the left and girls on the right. All know the initial wind and climate; the end is the fate gate, easy yet difficult. To understand the pulse patterns at the tiger&#39;s mouth, observe the lines from an inverted position, divided into five colors. Yellow and red signify harmony of the five organs; red and purple indicate gains and losses. Purple and blue suggest damage from excessive eating and weariness, while black patterns point to reverse conditions. Suddenly, pure black appears amidst, making skilled doctors&#39; hearts tremble. If it rises straight to the wind gate, the lengths of rice grains split at both ends. Like a gunshot startled by the wind, the fingers form various splits. A reversed bow indicates outward conditions, while intermingling of forward and reverse signifies difficult illnesses. The length of the splits can be treated; thus, doctors must observe carefully. A boy of two years is still considered an infant, while two to four years old is the young one&#39;s name. By five or six, youth grows gradually; at seven and eight, feelings begin to be discerned.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>When a child is nine-tenths in age and exhibits illness, one must discern the cause of the condition. At eleven, epilepsy is known as &quot;falling wind,&quot; while malnutrition resembles the afflictions of fatigue. A heaviness or stagnation is often identified, with a distinct feeling of heat or variations in temperature. Initially, a warm palm indicates the body&#39;s heat condition. If the belly feels warm while the body is cold, this suggests an accumulation of issues. Warm feet and a hot forehead imply a wind invasion, while a cool forehead and warm feet indicate fright. Rash and sores may erupt with redness behind the ears. For children with accumulated issues, emesis is advisable, especially in cases of three types of febrile illness. During food-related diarrhea, it is essential to manage accumulations, and for cold diarrhea, warming the spleen is necessary. For watery diarrhea, focus on draining excess from the organs. If a child suddenly cries out without reason, it may not be due to wind but rather a celestial disturbance. A loud cry with rapid breathing and a rough voice may indicate the ingestion of hot toxic substances causing distress. Immediate vomiting and harmonizing the spleen is crucial; administering fright-relieving medicines could be humorous under the circumstances.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>Children are in the early stage of life. The newborn is called an infant, a three-year-old is called a child, and a ten-year-old is called a youth. There are different sizes among children, and the severity of diseases varies among them. By observing their shape, color, voice, and pulse, if one can investigate these details carefully, they could be regarded as a skilled and wise practitioner.</p>
<p>To observe is to discern appearance and color. For example, the left cheek corresponds to the liver, the right cheek to the lungs, the forehead to the heart, the nose to the spleen, and the chin to the kidneys. If there is liver disease, the face turns green; if lung disease, the face turns pale; if heart disease, the face turns red; if spleen disease, the face turns yellow; and if kidney disease, the face turns dark. This is knowledge derived from observation.</p>
<p>To hear is to understand the condition through sound. For instance, with liver disease, the voice is mournful; with lung disease, the voice is hurried; with heart disease, the voice is strong; with spleen disease, the voice is slow; and with kidney disease, the voice is deep. These pertain to the organs. Additionally, if there is disease in the large intestine, the voice is prolonged; in the small intestine, the voice is short; in the stomach, the voice is quick; in the gallbladder, the voice is clear; and in the bladder, the voice is faint. This is knowledge derived from hearing.</p>
<p>To inquire is to ask about the disease’s origins. For example, if a person craves sour food, they may have liver disease; if they crave spicy food, they may have lung disease; if they crave bitter food, they may have heart disease; if they crave sweet food, they may have spleen disease; if they crave salty food, they may have kidney disease; if they prefer hot food, they may have internal cold; and if they prefer cold food, they may have internal heat. This is knowledge derived from inquiry.</p>
<p>To palpate is to feel the pulse and detect the disease.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>If a three-year-old child is unwell, first examine the left hand for boys and the right hand for girls at the tiger mouth&#39;s three points. From the side of the second finger, the first joint is called &quot;Wind Point,&quot; the second joint is called &quot;Qi Point,&quot; and the third joint is called &quot;Life Point.&quot; By distinguishing their colors and patterns: purple indicates heat, red signifies injury from cold, blue represents wind disturbance, white points to malnutrition, black denotes poison, and yellow reflects spleen distress. If observed at the Wind Point, the condition is mild; if at the Qi Point, it is severe; if exceeding the Life Point, it is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>For children over three years old, use one finger to press the inch, guan, and chi parts. Typically, six to seven beats are the standard; an increase suggests heat, a decrease implies cold, a floating pulse indicates excessive wind, a rapid pulse indicates frequent surprises, a deep and slow pulse implies deficiency, while a deep and firm pulse indicates accumulation. This is how one discerns through pulse diagnosis.</p>
<p>Generally, most illnesses in children arise from intrauterine toxins, with few resulting from dietary harm. External symptoms of wind and cold are usually limited. When a child is still in the womb, if the mother is hungry, the child feels it; if the mother is full, the child feels it too. Spicy or strong flavors can increase the fetal energy; emotional disturbances of the mother can agitate the child. Overeating fried or harsh foods, indulgence in overly spicy or acidic tastes, emotional volatility, or uncontrolled desires can all lead to problems for the child.</p>
<p>As for the mother, if she cannot exercise caution during pregnancy and fails to care properly after childbirth, she may only seek quick relief, neglecting prevention. This may lead to introducing overly salty or sour tastes before the child is even a hundred days old, or sweet and fatty foods before the child is one year old, resulting in various diseases. A child&#39;s spleen and stomach are inherently delicate and easily harmed by accumulation.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>If milk and food harm the stomach, it will lead to vomiting; if they harm the spleen, it will cause diarrhea. Prolonged vomiting and diarrhea can result in chronic fright or may lead to malnutrition. When milk and food stagnate, they produce damp phlegm; phlegm generates heat, and when phlegm and heat interact, it results in acute fright, or can lead to throat obstruction. If phlegm and heat congeal, it can lead to convulsions, or cause wheezing and coughing. Excess heat or cold during pregnancy indicates a prenatal condition. If there is a &quot;wind&quot; at the navel causing mouth twitching, this indicates toxins in the fetal essence. Canker sores in the mouth indicate damp heat in the stomach. A heavy or thick coat on the tongue indicates excess heat in the spleen channels. &quot;Zouma&quot; mouth sores signify deficiency of Qi with damp heat. A love for eating dirt indicates spleen dysfunction. If the fetus is startled and cries at night, this is due to evil heat disturbing the heart. If there is heat during transformation and evaporation, this suggests the dispersal of toxins from the fetus. Red rashes indicate heat manifesting externally, while retained heat signifies accumulated fire internally. Evil influences from outside indicate external pathogens. If startled while sleeping, this suggests internal fire movement. Throat obstruction results from heat toxins. Eye pain indicates excess heat. Ear pus indicates kidney energy rising. Nasal obstruction is caused by wind evil. Head sores come from heat toxins attacking. Umbilical sores indicate wind and dampness. Tailbone pain suggests yin deficiency with phlegm. Pain caused by insects signifies depletion of stomach Qi. Swelling in the groin indicates stagnation from cold. Abdominal pain is caused by cold interception. Rectal prolapse indicates deficiency and slackness of the large intestine. Bedwetting suggests cold and weakness of the bladder. Cloudy urine results from damp stagnation in the spleen and stomach. Blood in the stool indicates heat transmission to the heart and lungs. Painful urination indicates constrained heat in the bladder.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>Spitting blood indicates the reversal of vital energy and defense. Difficulty in urination signifies the presence of both yin and yang. Constipation reflects a combination of deficiency and excess. A disordered head and brittle joints point to an incompleteness of the essence of pregnancy. Delayed movements and speech suggest insufficient qi and blood. A protruding chest signifies lung heat and fullness. A humped back indicates the invasion of wind evil into the spine. Slow speech suggests evil affecting the heart. Delayed teeth indicate kidney deficiency. Malaria is due to phlegm accumulation above the diaphragm. Dysentery is caused by food stuck in the abdomen. Coughing is the result of wind injuring the lungs. Rapid breathing indicates excess phlegm and qi. Heart pain can be attributed to parasitic bites. Abdominal pain results from food injury. Internal injuries leading to fever result in a bitter mouth and dry tongue. External fevers cause nasal congestion and a heavy voice. Abdominal distension signifies weakened spleen and stomach. Edema arises from depleted earth and excess water. Jaundice suggests damp heat in the spleen and stomach. Rashes indicate toxic influences of yin and yang. Spontaneous sweating is a sign of qi deficiency. Accumulations have common causes and manifest as tangible blood. Aggregations lack specific location and manifest as intangible qi. The stomach governs receiving and the spleen governs transformation. Tuning the spleen and stomach is the royal way of medicine. Regulating diet is a good method to prevent illness. Sudden fever and accumulation of heat are common ailments in children. Observation, listening, inquiry, and pulse-taking are essential methods of physicians. Treating illnesses with medicine is like shooting arrows; when the arrow finds its mark, it evokes understanding that cannot be conveyed in words. As Mencius said: a carpenter can provide the tools and measurements for building, but cannot make a person skillful; therein lies the truth of these words.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br><strong>Entrance Examination and Symptom Observation Song</strong></p>

<p>A red face indicates wind-heat, a blue face signifies fright clearly. The heart and liver show this way, and pulse patterns distinguish warmth and coolness. The spleen’s weakness leads to yellow jaundice accumulation, while virtual cold shows as pale whiteness. If one encounters dark energy, it indicates the kidneys are failing and life is at risk.<br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Canon</strong> 【Ming Xu Chunfu】<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Variations in Fetal Qi Reception</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Golds&quot; states: A child receives the essence and qi from the mother during gestation. In the first month, the embryo forms; in the second month, the fetus develops; in the third month, blood vessels are established; in the fourth month, the shape takes form; in the fifth month, movement begins; in the sixth month, muscles and bones develop; in the seventh month, hair begins to grow; in the eighth month, internal organs are complete; in the ninth month, the spirit enters the stomach; and in the tenth month, a hundred spirits are ready, leading to birth. </p>
<p>Within sixty days after birth, the pupils form, allowing for smiling and recognition; by a hundred days, the meridians are complete, leading to the ability to turn and roll; at one hundred eighty days, the tailbone develops, enabling independent sitting; at two hundred ten days, the bones of the palm develop, allowing for crawling; at three hundred days, the kneecap forms, enabling standing; and at three hundred sixty days marks a full term, with the knee bones complete, allowing for walking. </p>
<p>This is the norm. If it is not so, the body will not attain balance. There may be cases where a child cannot walk or stand by the ages of four or five, which indicates an insufficiency in the reception of fetal qi. If the muscles are strong, there will be greater strength; if the bones are solid, walking will occur earlier; if the blood is abundant, the body will be slender and have more hair; if the flesh is sufficient, there will be fewer illnesses. If the essence is adequate, the child will be lively, talkative, and resilient to cold and heat; if the qi is abundant, there will be less hair but a robust body. These indicate a sufficient reception of fetal qi. </p>
<p>In general, the endowment should be moderate, with pure yin and yang, a balance of hardness and softness, harmony between qi and blood, complete spirit, and a strong physique. Before being fully developed, the skull should be well-formed and firm, the eyes bright and clear, the mouth rectangular with thick lips, bones sturdy and buttocks full, the navel deep and abdomen soft, the penis small and testes large, the teeth fine and hair glossy, the voice loud and sleep stable; these all reflect a balanced and harmonious reception of fetal qi. Thus, by listening to the voice and observing the form, one can discern health, vitality, and longevity.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Medication</strong></p>
<p>Human beings are endowed with the dual energies of yin and yang, which can manifest diseases in the three burners. However, adults are generally easier to treat, while young children are more difficult. The Yellow Emperor stated: &quot;I cannot discern the conditions of the very young, for that involves a separate method of regulation.&quot; This does not fall under the discussions in the Yellow Emperor&#39;s Classic.</p>
<p>He also mentioned: &quot;Children are like waves on water or dew on grass; when using medication, one must not act hastily.&quot; Indeed, children&#39;s organs are fragile, their blood and energy are insufficient, their bodies are not firm, and their spirit is not well-prepared, which is why they are said to be difficult to treat.</p>
<p>An infant is called a newborn, a child up to three years old is referred to as a young child, and those up to ten years old are called boys. The sizes and conditions vary greatly, so one must not apply the same treatment indiscriminately. It is essential to understand the nature of the condition, assess life and death, examine the depth of illness, and know the nature of the medicine, whether it is cold or warm. This is the mark of a skilled practitioner in the world.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br><strong>Observation of Form and Qi</strong></p>
<p>Form refers to the face’s appearance. Qi refers to the spirit and energy. Indeed, one aspect of understanding children&#39;s conditions lies in the correspondence between internal and external signs. Can one only perceive the condition through observing form like one plays the qin? This is true. Moreover, the vitality of a child does not solely depend on their fatness or thinness, but rather on their complexion and energy. How so? There are those who are plump yet weak in Qi, and those who are thin yet robust in Qi. When Qi is weak, the complexion must be pale, indicating deficiency; when Qi is strong, the complexion must be vibrant, indicating fullness. The energies of the five viscera manifest on the face: the liver shows as green, the heart as red, the lungs as white, the kidneys as black, and the spleen as yellow, representing the five colors. The liver thrives in spring, the heart in summer, the lungs in autumn, and the kidneys in winter, each for seventy-two days; the spleen flourishes eighteen days after each season, representing its fundamental position. However, there are times in the spring and winter when the face turns greenish-black, which is not related to the liver or kidneys. In times not autumn or summer, when the face turns reddish-white, this is not attributed to the heart or lungs. The colors of the Qi from the five viscera layer upon each other, manifesting and flowing based on the condition, with no fixed pattern.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>Suddenly, black corresponds to pain, suddenly red corresponds to heat, suddenly white corresponds to cold, and suddenly yellow corresponds to accumulation; this opening and closing of qi is not bound by time or location. Additionally, just as the heart governs the forehead, the liver governs the eyes and the left side of the face, the spleen governs the upper and lower lips, the lung governs the right side of the face, and the kidney governs the area in front of and below the ears—these forms may be seen in their positions or revealed in other areas. This is known as the ungraspable aspect; this is the selection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the spleen governs the lips for purposes of expulsion and diarrhea, if there is lingering illness associated with this and the color appears black, then the kidney is overpowering the spleen, where water counteracts earth, referred to as strong dominance, which may lead to failure of that organ. The liver governs the eyes and the left side of the face, its color being blue, which is its true color; it relates to shock and fright, indicating a favorable condition. However, if white is seen, it indicates the lung is overcoming the liver, which signifies an unfavorable condition. By examining these observations and connecting them, the outcome depends on the individual.</p>
<p>Infants observe the five colors of the face to determine the source of illness, and also check whether the eyes are spirited or lack spirit, where spirit refers to the brightness and radiance in the eyes. The latent and manifest, the horizontal and intense manifestations, should correspond to the locations and the five organs and colors, namely: blue (liver), red (heart), yellow (spleen), white (lung), and black (kidney). All five organs correspond to illnesses confined within, which must show in external form and color. When an infant is ill, one should first observe the shapes and colors in the main body, discuss the interactions of the five elements and assess fortune or misfortune; if the shapes and colors correspond, then one may listen to sounds and take the pulse.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p>
<h3>Observations on the Symptoms of Illness</h3>
<p>A severe illness leaves the lips red and beyond remedy, while the eyes seem slow and do not match. The eyes are blue, the cheeks red, and there is a dry blackness; hair stands straight, and the caw of the crow turns to tears. The hands and feet lack lines, the fingertips are white; the nose is dry and hot, and the corners of the mouth droop. When one is in a daze unable to open the mouth or eyes, even immortals would find it hard to treat.</p>
<p>The essence of the five organs can be discerned from the face; if the liver is ill, the face turns blue. In the spring, a white gas manifests, and this illness must be cast aside and avoided. </p>
<p>Eyes that are both red and white, along with black, indicate that if the face is yellow, the illness is easier to cure. Eyes that are black in combination with blue, red, and white, with no yellow on the face, will have no hope of recovery.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>The blue color on the face indicates accumulated shock that has not dispersed and may signal a pending wind condition. The red color signifies heat, and signifies phlegm accumulation leading to shock, irritability, and exacerbation of symptoms. The yellow color also represents heat, caused by food stagnation, mass disorders, and abdominal distension, potentially leading to symptoms of fever and fatigue, or vomiting and diarrhea. The white color indicates cold, and suggests impaired lung qi leading to diarrhea or a desire to vomit. The black color represents pain transmitted without relief, indicative of a reverse condition, disordered defense and nourishment, and phlegm, denoting a dire situation.</p>
<p>A normal red color on the lips signifies no illness, while dryness might indicate spleen heat, and white denotes deficiency. Dark areas in the philtrum indicate abdominal pain from worms; speckled black indicates vomiting and diarrhea. Purple under the nasal root suggests injury from dairy or food, and blue indicates shock; black signals danger. </p>
<p>A blue mark on the glabella indicates shock; red indicates heat, while white signifies the absence of disease. A blue forehead implies shock; red signifies heat. </p>
<p>Red between the eyebrows indicates nighttime crying with heat; deep black in the eyes with yellow suggests damage from cold, while white in the eyes indicates accumulation due to dampness. Bright red in the heart indicates heat, light red suggests heart deficiency with heat, and blue indicates liver heat. </p>
<p>A red bloodshot sun indicates shock; blue denotes shock in the second line, while red indicates cold damage. The right side showcasing blue indicates shock, red indicates heat, and black signals a dire condition. </p>
<p>A red wind pool indicates increased crying, while yellow suggests vomiting. Blue veins near the golden valley indicate shock. </p>
<p>Both cheeks being red signifies heat and crying. Red on the cheekbones indicates heat. A yellow color near the nasal tip indicates vomiting and shock, along with red heat, purplish phlegm, and blue shock. The yellow color in the labyrinth suggests vomiting and shock.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>The eyes lack brilliance, the pupils are lifeless, the membranes on the eyeballs are red, and the veins penetrate the pupils; these are all signs of death. </p>
<p>On the forehead, the heart sign: red indicates wind-heat in the heart, leading to restlessness and palpitations, making it difficult to lie or sit still. A dark blue-black color, with evil present, signifies wind-induced abdominal pain. The &quot;Precious Mirror&quot; states: the heart is disturbed by evil, the hands go numb and there are screams. If the blue-black is severe, it results in pain in the heart and abdomen. A pale yellow dryness of the skin signifies night sweats and dry hair. A yellow dryness indicates a fever, phlegm-dryness, and mild thirst. </p>
<p>On the nose, the spleen sign: red indicates body heat and loss of appetite. Deep yellow suggests difficulty in urination, dry nostrils, and coarse breathing, signifying a risk of nosebleed. The &quot;Precious Mirror&quot; states: if the nose is dry and wheezing, with a sound in the breath, it indicates a risk of nosebleed from lung heat. A light white color suggests diarrhea and undigested food. </p>
<p>On the chin, the kidney sign: redness indicates heat in the bladder. The bladder and kidneys are interconnected; if there is heat, the water passage becomes blocked, resulting in difficulty urinating. </p>
<p>On the left cheek, the liver sign: redness indicates body heat and rigidity, a sign of liver wind heat. Blue-black suggests fright or abdominal pain. A light red indicates tidal heat and irritability. There is a certain type of child who experiences tidal heat at night, but appears restless during the day, with red, dry lips, which could indicate a false diagnosis. The pulse must be tense and rapid. </p>
<p>On the right cheek, the lung sign: redness indicates body heat, a light color signifies tidal heat, or difficulty with coarse breathing and coughing. A blue-white color indicates cough and nausea. A blue color indicates wind entering the lungs, leading to frequent coughs. A blue-black color suggests fright or pain in the abdomen, as an infant may suffer because of intestinal issues. </p>
<p>The space between the eyebrows: a blue-black color indicates abdominal pain and night crying.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>&quot;The Spirit of Mystery&quot; states: If the area between the eyebrows is dark greenish-black and there are night cries, this indicates a cold causing headaches and a cold that leads to prolonged diarrhea. &quot;The Spirit of Mystery&quot; also indicates that dysentery is associated with a furrowed brow. The Wang family notes: If the center of the eyebrows is pale white, it indicates loose stools of a white color, suggesting undigested food.</p>
<p>In terms of the &quot;Ren Zhong&quot; (middle of the human) evidence: &quot;The Treasure Mirror&quot; states that yellow on both sides of the Ren Zhong indicates food injury. If the lower part of Ren Zhong is bluish, it suggests undigested milk, with clear stools of a white color. &quot;The Spirit of Mystery&quot; further notes that if both the Ren Zhong and beneath the nose are bluish, it also indicates that milk and food are not being digested.</p>
<p>Regarding lip and mouth evidence: White lips suggest vomiting of saliva and reversed peristalsis, as well as the vomiting of blood and blood in the stool. Red, dry, and wrinkled lips indicate thirst. &quot;The Spirit of Mystery&quot; mentions that thirst brings red lips. If the red lips are smooth and not wrinkled, it indicates bad breath, constipation, and restlessness at night. Red, dry, and hot indicates heat.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>Wang stated: Bad breath and yellow lips indicate accumulation in the spleen, which will later lead to swelling. At night, one may experience white, watery diarrhea. He also mentioned: Purple lips and mouth, along with drooling, indicate pain from parasites. The &quot;Treatise on Flying Immortals&quot; states: Purple lips and mouth without drooling indicate accumulated pain. The &quot;Precious Mirror&quot; notes: Yellow lips around the mouth like an orange indicate bad breath, which is due to accumulated heat in the spleen. The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; text states: Red lips indicate heat in the heart and can lead to sores on the mouth and tongue. The &quot;Supreme Secret&quot; mentions: Red lips indicate nosebleeds; white lips with red heat indicate movement and shock. It also says: If the mouth drips clear water, there may be a heavy tongue, indicating mouth sores. Qian stated: Frequent gasping from the mouth without harmony suggests Yellowsan. Wen noted: Blood deficiency can cause fear and be overpowered by cold, leading to blue lips. Master Sun mentioned: Blue lips indicate cold in the spleen, which may sometimes cause abdominal pain and reduced appetite. The spleen opens to the lips, and wood conquers earth. If the spleen is weak, it cannot digest. If someone who has been thirsty for a long time has red lips, it indicates a deficiency condition, and cooling herbs should not be used.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br><strong>Tongue Signs:</strong> A dry, black, white, or dry tongue, along with a thick coating, a yellow tongue, or a red swollen tongue indicate severe constipation, even if there is a little passage. A scorched yellow tongue, cracks on the tongue, spiny protrusions, and blood on the tongue all point to extreme heat and toxic conditions. Ulcers on the tongue indicate heat in the heart and spleen. A curled tongue suggests shock. In cases of persistent diarrhea or dysentery, a black tongue must be moist; it should not be considered heat. This indicates lingering heat in the upper part of the body, and if the tongue is black and continues to be dry, it could lead to death if untreated.</p>
<p><strong>Qi Stagnation Signs:</strong> If there is a sensation of qi blockage, it must indicate a state of shock. According to &quot;Ling Mi,&quot; it is known that drinking with dysphagia may lead to death. If there are frequent sighs, choking, or yawning, these symptoms signify shock.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Signs:</strong> According to Wang, a slightly red outer ear indicates deafness, while a slight yellow suggests kidney shock, particularly if there is teeth grinding during sleep. A dry ear rim indicates heat from bone steaming due to deficiency.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>The complexion is pale, indicating nausea and inability to eat, accompanied by sudden diarrhea. A bluish-white face signifies vomiting and diarrhea. &quot;Ling Mi&quot; states that it indicates the onset of fright. According to Wang&#39;s interpretation, a blue face with white lips suggests undigested milk and a cold stomach. &quot;Nan Jing&quot; notes that a white face accompanied by sneezing indicates sorrow and a desire to cry.</p>
<p>A bluish-black face, if accompanied by foaming, suggests pain from parasites; if there is no foam, it indicates food accumulation, also linked to fright. &quot;Ling Mi&quot; warns of a risk of wind stroke. A blue complexion, with heat spreading throughout the body, suggests a variant of dysentery. A sweating blue complexion with hot breath in the mouth signals impending pain. The above three diagnoses are from &quot;Ling Mi.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Bao Jian&quot; states that a yellow face during sleep suggests night sweats, a bluish-white face indicates fright, a bluish-black face occasionally foaming signals conflicts, while a blackish-blue face points to dangerous cries from wind stroke. </p>
<p>A blue face with red cheeks indicates strong heat and convulsions. A blue-white-black face with unpredictable pain suggests abdominal discomfort and unquenchable thirst without pause.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>The &quot;Treasure Mirror&quot; states: a red face with yellow and white indicates a strong heat from heart fire. The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; mentions: a red face with yellow eyes signifies incontinence. The &quot;Tong Zhen Zi&quot; says: a face with blue veins shows irritability or frequent anger. </p>
<p>A red face indicates the onset of febrile diseases, restlessness of the heart, and a propensity to panic or lose control. The &quot;Ling Mi&quot; states it suggests a body heat from febrile illness. According to &quot;Tong Zhen Zi,&quot; a red face with anxiety still shows a tendency to smile.</p>
<p>A yellow face with a red hue indicates febrile conditions with chills and spasms, and restless sleep; if there is slight redness within the flesh, it suggests digestive heat issues. The Qian family notes that heart fire with a yellow and red face indicates strong heat, best treated with An Shen Wan.</p>
<p>A yellow and white face suggests accumulation leading to digestive irregularities, nighttime awakenings, poor digestion, and vomiting. The &quot;Treasure Mirror&quot; states that a yellow and white face has an accumulation issue. The &quot;Ling Mi&quot; mentions a yellow and white face indicates spleen and lung accumulation.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>Tong Zhenzi said: A pale yellow complexion and incessant diarrhea. Qian mentioned: A face with a whitish hue, gas escaping from the stomach, and a lack of appetite for food. A yellow face indicates spleen heat jaundice. The &quot;Treasure Mirror&quot; states that jaundice is caused by stomach heat. Qian also said: This symptom often occurs after a severe illness. If the body is faintly yellow without prior illness, it indicates stomach heat. A yellow face and a swollen abdomen signify spleen ulceration. When a newborn&#39;s body is yellow, it is called fetal jaundice.</p>
<p>Blue veins on the head and face indicate a tendency for convulsions due to heat, often leading to spasms and abdominal pain when vomiting occurs. If the veins on the head and face appear like green ropes, urgent treatment is necessary. Otherwise, convulsions may ensue, and recovery becomes difficult. </p>
<p>Inconsistent facial discoloration, with fluctuating facial colors, indicates a disturbance of the fetus due to fright and may also signify disharmony in interactions. A face that fluctuates between blue, white, or black indicates abdominal pain.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br><strong>Facial Color Diagnosis Song</strong></p>
<p>The two cheeks relate to the liver and lungs, the nose corresponds to the spleen. The forehead represents the heart, while the chin relates to the kidneys. There are internal shapes reflected externally; observing them reveals the pathologies. A red face with blue lips indicates a warm disease from cold damage. In cases of wind-stroke, the blue-black hue on lips and face is telling. A yellow complexion suggests numerous illnesses; even malaria does not escape this. A pale face often indicates diarrhea, while dysentery furrows the brow. A green face indicates liver disease, particularly hard to treat in spring. To overcome wood, summon gold; this logic applies broadly.</p>
<p><strong>Longevity and Mortality Song</strong></p>
<p>Soft body and impotence indicate trouble, with a small, high navel and a lack of flesh. Sparse hair, tender in color, short in length, and a crying voice; veins visible throughout the body suggest a lack of longevity. If the buttocks, heels, and patella are poorly developed, one can neither stand nor move and is prone to death. A deep navel with a dark hue and a dignified bearing signifies a person destined for a long life.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a></p>
<h3>Eye Examination Method</h3>
<p>Childhood ailments may appear daunting, but if the pulse is strong at Tai Chong and the spirit is not exhausted, and the fontanel is not sunken, if the coloration at the three positions does not show dark spots, then hope is within reach. Nevertheless, the essence of the five organs and six bowels rises to the eyes; by observing this, one can ascertain the condition, but first, one must verify by the full spirit in the eyes. If there is spirit in the eyes, survival is assured; if the eyes lack spirit, death is certain.</p>
<h3>Sources of Illness</h3>
<p>After great joy, if one consumes milk and food, it may lead to seizures. Joy pertains to the heart; excessive joy from food harms the heart. According to Qian, the heart governs shock, and shock leads to seizures. &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: Violent anger injures Yin, and excessive joy injures Yang. Sun Zhenren says: injuring Yin leads to diarrhea, injuring Yang leads to shock. Tong Zhenzi notes: Drinking water after great joy harms the San Jiao and can often lead to wheezing. </p>
<p>Crying excessively after consuming milk and food frequently results in vomiting and diarrhea. According to Qian, crying relates to the lungs; excessive crying after food injures the lungs, and if lung Qi is reversed, it leads to vomiting and diarrhea. The lungs and large intestine are interrelated, thus resulting in diarrhea.</p>
<p>After extreme hunger, consuming milk and food may often cause abdominal pain. &quot;Qian Jin&quot; states: Hungry people eating hastily may often develop abdominal pain. &quot;Xiu Zhen Mi&quot; notes: Overeating when hungry causes accumulation and distention. It also states: Do not eat hastily; hasty consumption injures the spleen. Bian Que states: Eating too hastily over time leads to blockages and pallor. After excessive fullness, drinking water often causes Qi deficiency.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; states: Excessive drinking causes the lungs to spread and become unbalanced, leading to the upward flow of Qi and the production of phlegm diseases. The &quot;Immortal Classic&quot; says: After a full meal, if exposed to the wind, one may suffer from sudden convulsions and lose consciousness, resembling a stroke. After a great fright, consuming milk or food can cause vomiting and heart pain. Following a fright while consuming milk or food leads to the invasion of the small Yin channels, often resulting in heart pain. The &quot;Hold to Simplicity&quot; explains: A fright combined with milk, food, or drinking water causes Qi stagnation, which could result in various vomiting and stomach disturbances. The texts say: Drinking water after a fright harms the heart, causing the tongue to become unable to speak. </p>
<p>When infants drink milk in the wind, it can lead to coughing and abdominal bloating. The sage Zang said: When infants drink milk in the wind, the cold wind enters the lungs, causing coughing. The &quot;Treasure Mirror&quot; states: Cold wind injures breastfeeding, leading to infants experiencing vomiting and a cold, bloated abdomen. Another text states: Cold bodily conditions and cold drinks harm the lungs, which leads to coughing. The lungs govern Qi; if Qi is harmed, it results in abdominal bloating. </p>
<p>Exposure to night dew while breastfeeding infants often leads to vomiting. The &quot;True Cultivation Manual&quot; states: Night dew affects breastfeeding infants, as cold milk entering the throat does not disperse and often results in vomiting and reflux.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>The &quot;Baojian&quot; states: When a mother nurses during her menstruation, it causes reversed energy to stagnate in the chest, leading to vomiting. If she eats properly before nursing, it results in the child developing a yellow, malodorous mouth. Wang&#39;s commentary notes that proper meals before nursing cause the child’s mouth to stink and lead to bleeding from the gums. Tongzhenzi mentions that both milk and food cause the child’s face to turn yellow and mouth to smell bad, and can also produce phlegm and cysts.</p>
<p>If a mother sweats before nursing, it leads to heart damp and strong heat. Ge Hong explains that sweat is the liquid of the heart; if there is excessive sweating before nursing, it injures the heart. When the heart is damaged, the fluids disperse, causing the skin to dry out and resulting in heart damp and strong heat.</p>
<p>Feeding milk to children after consuming hot foods often leads to a condition known as &#39;turtle chest.&#39; Sun Zhao observes that if a mother eats strong-flavored foods, it results in the child developing turtle chest. Xu’s commentary states that if hot foods are consumed before nursing, over time, the child will definitely develop turtle chest.</p>
<p>If a mother consumes sour and salty grilled food before nursing her child, it leads to thirst. The &quot;Shenghui Fang&quot; states that if the nursing mother indulges in strong-flavored grilled foods and rich flavors, it causes heat in the child&#39;s internal organs, leading to restlessness and incessant thirst. It also mentions that if the child consumes soy sauce meat and then drinks water, it can result in thirst and diarrhea.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>Drunkenly lying in the wind, the infant loses its voice. When the wet nurse is drunkenly lying in the wind, the child loses the ability to speak. Baopuzi states: When the wet nurse drinks excessively and cools herself in the wind, the cold air and the wine poison mix with the milk and enter the infant&#39;s throat, causing the child to lose its voice and remain silent.</p>
<p>Coughing after nursing leads to choking on phlegm. After a cough, if the infant drinks milk, the phlegm gathers and does not disperse, causing the airways to be obstructed and preventing the diaphragm from functioning, leading to choking on phlegm and sudden wheezing.</p>
<p>If sorrow and joy are unsettled and nursing occurs, it results in drooling and coughing. Mengzi states: If sorrow and joy are uncertain when nursing, the child will surely drool, cough, and draw in wind. The Baojian states: If sorrow and joy are unsettled, drinking water will cause the qi to reverse, the qi will overpower the blood, and if the blood vessels are obstructed, it often results in spitting blood.</p>
<p>If the infant cries and nursing occurs before the cry settles, it leads to the formation of goiter. In general, if the infant&#39;s crying has not settled and is immediately silenced with milk, the qi cannot dissipate and thus accumulates into a goiter. Mengzi states: If the infant cries and the lung passages are open, and it is nursed immediately, it goes against the qi, causing the qi to condense and accumulate, often resulting in lumpy goiters and tumors.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a></p>
<h3>Song of No Suffering</h3>
<p>The child’s appearance and demeanor are notably different. The nose is dry with no mucus, the throat is silent with no drool. The head is like dye of azure, the lips are like freshly painted vermilion. The face is square, reflecting flowers and bamboo, the cheeks burst with water lilies. He happily invites a smile, though he does not express himself openly at the right time. Even if he cries, it is not for long; even if he sleeps, it is not for too long. His disposition is like still waves, his nature like a sky mirrored in a still lake. This child has much peace and goodness; what is there to worry about in being plagued by illness?</p>
<h3>Diagnosing Illness by Sound</h3>
<p>The &quot;Records of Music&quot; states: all sounds arise from the human heart. The movements of the heart are influenced by external things. When affected by objects, the heart moves, hence it manifests in sound. Sounds respond to one another, thus generating changes. Human sickness is hidden within, but the voice reveals it externally. When music is chaotic, the five tones are disharmonious; when the human voice is chaotic, the five organs are disharmonious. Therefore, listening to sounds is a way to diagnose people&#39;s illnesses. The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; says: by observing breathing and listening to sounds, one knows the source of suffering. Thus, the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; states: use the five energies, five colors, and five sounds to observe life and death. The sage Sun said: when the five organs are disharmonious, the five sounds are out of tune, the five colors are uncertain, there certainly will be illness. The &quot;Three Causes Method&quot; says: observe the excess or deficiency of the five organs; the throat pertains to sounds, it maintains balance. When balanced, the energy is strong; when deficient, the energy is weak. Therefore, the voice is like coming from a room, indicating the sparseness of energy. If words are few, and only said once every day, it can deplete energy. Words, whether good or bad, do not avoid kinship or distance, thus disturbing the spirit and clarity. When the sounds do not follow one another in intent, yin and yang are lost. Therefore, it is said: those who maintain balance are alive, while those who lose it are dead.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>Conditions of Various Illnesses</p>
<p>When a child cries with a deep voice and doesn’t respond, it indicates a serious illness, making it difficult for physicians to treat. A lighter, more floating voice indicates a milder condition that can be easily addressed. A dry and sunken forehead, tense tendons, red lips on the outside but pale on the inside, sores without moisture, and severe cases accompanied by agitation suggest extreme heat. Red eyes indicate an accumulation of heat in the liver, and light sensitivity may imply liver disturbance. Tooth decay and disrupted digestion from milk suggest toxicity, while indigestion signifies cold accumulation in the spleen. Hearing loss points to kidney deficiency, while infantile eczema suggests wind accumulation in the lungs. Fluctuating body temperature may be caused by shock, while emotional expressions like sorrow or singing indicate an invasion of evil energies into the spleen. Mouth ulcers and abdominal bloating from stagnant accumulation, gas reversal leading to vomiting, and malarial fever point to spleen damage. Sleeping with the mouth open signals excess toxicity in the five organs, while excessive crying indicates shock moving into the lungs. A craving for soil suggests intestinal parasites in the spleen, and night sweats indicate blood deficiency with heat. Palms feeling hot suggest malnutrition and fatigue, while ear ringing indicates obstruction by heat in the kidney channel, and bloating with nausea points to spleen and stomach accumulation. A craving for charcoal suggests liver parasitism, while consuming tea leaves indicates heart involvement, and eating raw rice indicates issues with the spleen. Analyzing using logic and measuring by intention reflects the comprehensive wisdom of a physician.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br><strong>Song of Various Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>Little children with various ailments must be understood; it doesn&#39;t matter whether they are sons or daughters. Excessive sleep is due to the liver being the root; heat accumulates in the heart, causing nighttime screams. Calling out and sweating cold are due to pain from worms; cold and heat accumulate in the spleen. A red face and mouth sores indicate obstruction in the heart and lungs; the wind of deficiency causes limbs to tremble and droop. Cold and slippery can harm the spleen or cause diarrhea, with pus or blood flowing at any time. Excess accumulation makes the belly large, sloshing with water; wheezing and a yellowish complexion shouldn&#39;t be overlooked. Eyes drooping, spitting saliva, and a hurried head movement; do not let the pulse slow down or become faint. How foolish to ask spirits instead of seeking genuine medicine; they suffer needlessly while seeking out sorcerers.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a></p>
<h3>Mixed Evidence of Disease Mechanisms</h3>
<p>Sudden fright leads to wide-open eyes, while chronic fright causes eyes to close. Crying without tears indicates agitation, while tears without crying signify restlessness. A protruding tongue signifies wind, and closed eyes that resemble sleep without craving food signify emptiness. Abdominal pain that feels full points to qi stagnation, while turning over and lying down indicates spleen illness. Changing hands to wave and crying upon hearing words signifies a solid condition. Clear nasal discharge indicates cold in the lung channel. Shaking the head with a stiff neck suggests heat in the triple warmer. Fish-like eyes fixed wide signal night death; a pale face with black lips signifies death during the day.</p>
<h3>Song of Untreated Mixed Diseases</h3>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea lead to wind, with a membrane over the eyes, and wind is felt but not grasped. Sudden fright leads to unending panting; chronic fright causes thin skin. Intestinal issues lead to loneliness in the heart, with cough, vomiting, and reversed heartache. In severe cold, red veins crossing indicate blackened faces and hair loss. Smallpox entering the eyes results in inability to open them; heat spilling out leads to dry mouth and aversion. A locked jaw, low waist, and blackened lips indicate severe dysentery and spleen toxicity, with rolled-up lips. These diseases arise from fright without accumulation; how could immortals leave behind miraculous medicine?</p>
<h3>Caution Against Carelessly Taking Medicine<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a></h3>
<p>In the case of Luo Qianfu, a young boy in May, after eating cold starch, experienced abdominal pain. He then purchased Shenqiong pills from a pharmacy, which caused his belly and abdomen to grow increasingly cold and painful, with the pain coming and going for over seven or eight years without relief. He remembered the ancient saying: &quot;To treat cold, one must use heat.&quot; To cure cold with heat is a principle that even skilled doctors should not abandon. The substance that harmed him was cold; the medicine he took was also cold. A heavy cold injures the stomach, which explains the cold disease he suffered from. Generally, a person&#39;s spleen and stomach prefer warmth and dislike cold. Moreover, a child&#39;s blood and qi are still weak, making him unable to withstand such cold. Hence, the Yang energy becomes concealed, and the cold poison lingers, remaining for a long time without removal. To treat an illness, one must first address its root cause; thus, one should use harmonizing and qi-nurturing medicine to remedy past mistakes. After taking the right medicine for a month, he finally healed. Alas! When Kongzi received medicine, he said he would not dare taste it until he understood it; this is crucial for preserving life. How could one simply remain silent and insist on feeling the pulse, believing they could identify the illness? The pulse reflects a person&#39;s blood and qi, flowing between the meridians: when heat prevails, the pulse is rapid; when cold prevails, the pulse is slow; when real, it is strong; when empty, it is weak. How could one distinguish what injured him merely by its shape? Physicians must carefully examine the source of the illness. Additionally, the father of this boy did not inform the doctor of the source of the illness but sought remedies in the marketplace, resulting in seven years of suffering, all because he overlooked this principle. Master Sun said: &quot;Before diagnosing, it is best to inquire first,&quot; which is very accurate. Dongpo said: &quot;If one only seeks to cure the illness, without considering the physician&#39;s burden.&quot; The words of these two sages greatly benefit the world.</p>
<p>Children are harder to treat than adults.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>The way of medicine is indeed difficult. Therefore, treating children is particularly challenging. The revered Sun said: &quot;To be able to treat ten men is not as good as treating one woman.&quot; Why is that? Men are robust and vigorous, while women&#39;s blood and veins are complicated, especially with childbirth making treatment more difficult. The &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; states: &quot;Women&#39;s illnesses are ten times more difficult to treat than men&#39;s.&quot; It also says: &quot;To be able to treat ten women is not as good as treating one child.&quot; Why is that? Women can discuss their illnesses, their blood andqi are still intact; children cannot express themselves, their spirits are not fully developed, and pulse-taking is hard to rely on; thus, they are said to be difficult to treat.</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was said that understanding from observing was called &quot;spiritual insight,&quot; and pediatricians are known as the &quot;dumb doctors.&quot; When examining, it is particularly important to observe color, so it is addressed first. When observing an infant&#39;s face, one must discern five colors to understand the source of illness. The human body has five parts, with the head being the foremost; within the head is the face, and within the face are the eyes, where illumination is found. The &quot;spirit&quot; refers to the brightness of the eyes, which can be seen through their clarity and reaction, corresponding to the five internal organs. The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. The colors of the five organs are as follows: the heart is red, the liver is blue, the spleen is yellow, the lungs are white, and the kidneys are black. The illnesses corresponding to the five organs are contained within and must manifest in outward appearance. Therefore, when a child is ill, one should first observe the color and shape of the main body to discuss the influences of the five elements regarding fortune and misfortune. If the color and shape do not correspond, then one should listen to sounds and take the pulse.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a></p>
<h3>Diagnostic Indicators on the Face</h3>
<p>The left cheek corresponds to the liver and is associated with the left hand&#39;s pressure points; the separation of liver and gallbladder corresponds to wind and wood, representing the initial phase of energy. The right cheek corresponds to the lungs and is associated with the right hand&#39;s pulse; the separation of lungs and large intestine corresponds to dryness and metal, representing the fifth phase of energy. The forehead corresponds to the heart and is associated with the left hand&#39;s pulse; the separation of heart and small intestine corresponds to the sovereign fire, representing the second phase of energy. The nose corresponds to the spleen and is associated with the right hand&#39;s pulse; the separation of spleen and stomach corresponds to dampness and earth, representing the fourth phase of energy. The chin corresponds to the kidneys and is associated with the left hand&#39;s little finger; the separation of kidneys and bladder corresponds to cold and water, representing the final phase of energy. </p>
<p>Red indicates heat. Yellow indicates accumulation. White indicates cold. Blue-black indicates pain. Treatment should follow these indicators. </p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Child&#39;s Formula&quot; states: the left cheek belongs to the liver, situated in the east. In spring, a slight bluish hue is normal; a deep bluish hue indicates illness, while white signifies a crisis. Red indicates body heat and rigidity, while liver heat produces wind; black denotes fright and abdominal pain; pale red indicates tidal heat, appearing at night and lessening during the day, with dry, red lips and a tight, rapid pulse. </p>
<p>The right cheek corresponds to the lungs, situated in the west. In autumn, a slight whitish hue is normal; a deep white indicates illness, while red signifies a crisis.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>Light colors indicate heat in the body, possibly leading to hard stools and coarse, urgent breathing; bluish-white suggests coughing and nausea; blue indicates wind entering the lungs, causing frequent coughing; dark blue-black suggests impending convulsions, or abdominal pain with twisting intestines. </p>
<p>The forehead corresponds to the heart, situated in the south, where fire tends to rise. A slight red indicates balance, a deep red signifies illness, and black indicates a critical condition. Red suggests wind-heat in the heart, with palpitations, restlessness, and disturbed sleep; dark blue implies evil in the heart, causing convulsions and abdominal pain, with limbs twitching and crying; a very dark blue indicates severe heart and abdominal pain; yellow indicates disturbing febrile conditions, bone heat, thirst, dryness of skin and hair, and excessive night sweats. </p>
<p>The nose corresponds to the spleen, located centrally, thus it is seen throughout the seasons. A slight yellow indicates balance, a deep yellow signifies illness, and blue indicates a critical condition. Red indicates body heat and lack of appetite; deep yellow suggests urinary obstruction, dry nostrils, coarse breathing, and frequent crying at night; pale white indicates diarrhea and undigested food; blue indicates vomiting, dry mouth and nose, and difficulty with bowel movements. </p>
<p>The chin corresponds to the kidneys, located in the north, where water flows downwards. In winter, a slight black indicates balance, a deep black signifies illness, and yellow indicates a critical condition.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>The red represents the bladder, which corresponds to the kidneys, and when there is heat, the water pathways are hindered, leading to urinary obstruction. The liver governs the eyes, particularly the pupils. The spirit of the internal organs is contained within, while externally it relates to the five aspects. The eye sockets belong to the spleen, and heat produces phlegm. Both canthi are associated with the heart; when there is heat, it causes pain like needles. White belongs to the lungs; heat generates stones. Yellow relates to the liver; it causes cloudiness and impairment of vision. The central pupil is linked to heat in the kidneys, causing unclear vision. Eyes suddenly blink and dart, indicating wind and fright.</p>
<p>The heart governs: the cheekbones and facial cheeks belong to the heart position. Black denotes heaviness and despair; blue indicates fright and palpitations. Red certainly indicates wind; white points to consumption and gas. If there is a deficiency of yellow energy, it can lead to swelling and counterflow of qi; why has the heart suddenly given out? A loud cry several times. If one passes through without a sound, it must result in a crow’s call. Adding heat leads to shock and surprises, dispersing heat to clear the heart.</p>
<p>The spleen governs: the lips and mouth reveal illnesses, with the philtrum receiving fluid. Surrounding top and bottom are collectively known as the spleen territory. The mouth opening relates to the heart, as heart and spleen can have heat. Cracked lips and tongue sores indicate accumulated heat in the three burners. Lips red like blood indicate deep thirst. Candidiasis and thick tongue occur with heat in the spleen and lungs, causing foul breath. Cold qi within the spleen and kidneys turns the complexion to a lifeless liver color. A sudden fright can lead to dry mouth and pale lips. Frequent accumulation of fear must eventually affect the heart. Insufficient heart qi causes children to be restless and cry. How can one know the spleen is compromised? All the nails turn black.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>Without the divine light in the eyes, it is indeed difficult to use medicine. The five forms of symptoms at the mouth indicate more severe wind, serving as evidence of untreatable conditions. </p>
<p>The lungs govern: the two nostrils and the bridge of the nose, together with the inner and outer canthi, are where the lungs reside. If the nostrils appear dark and sooty, it indicates a severe condition of the lung channels. This soot is as dark as ink, signaling a dire state of the lungs. If there&#39;s redness and itching within the nose, it suggests a condition of excessive heat and parasites. If there is a flow of white mucus, it indicates cold in the brain causing lethargy. A flow of greenish mucus suggests a cold caused by wind, which makes one prone to sleep. Lung heat leads to nasal obstruction caused by breathing. If one feels the nose is ulcerated, it indicates a state of depletion. A foul odor signifies accumulated heat.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern: the area before the ear, called the ear flower. The ear&#39;s edge is known as the rim, and the space within is referred to as the curve. If the rim appears blackened, it indicates weakness and heat in the kidneys. If it is as dark as charcoal, it suggests a critical state of the kidneys. If there are sores at the ear gate, it indicates significant accumulation. If pus flows from the ear, it indicates extreme heat and depletion of the kidneys. Foul odor leads to ear ringing, with continual discharge. If sores itch as if cracking, it is a sign of internal heat. Suddenly losing hearing indicates stifled heart and kidney energy. There is often a rumbling sound, as heat rises. It may feel as if insects are crawling, signaling both depletion and heat from defenses. If the ear rim feels icy, further examination should reveal red veins; this may indicate an invasion of variola. A red and hot ear rim suggests a febrile condition. Extreme internal pain hinges on swelling and pressure. To clear the heart and cool the diaphragm, one must unblock channels and openings. </p>
<p>When it comes to children and their kidneys, they often remain weak without significant illness. One must not apply aggressive treatments, as supplementation would be of little use.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br><strong>Listening to Sounds</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heavy and Real Sounds:</strong> Heavy and real sounds, strong and warm in the three burners, show stagnation of qi in the heart and spleen. Winds causing coughs and sore throats, sluggish bowel movements with delayed stool discharge.</p>
<p><strong>Sad and Frantic Sounds:</strong> Sad and frantic sounds indicate restlessness, fearing that wind may arise. Heavy and turbid sounds are calm, but can lead to deafness from malnutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Crying and Weeping Sounds:</strong> Merely crying without sound merely indicates shock; much weeping without crying signifies clear pain. Light, trembling, and hoarse sounds suggest wind-related seizures, while rapid or slow sounds indicate frequent vomiting or diarrhea.</p>
<p>**煎 Sounds (Troublesome Sounds):**煎 sounds signify troubling agitation, with dry and hurried voices indicating cold affliction. Short phrases with weak gas indicate sluggishness, whereas prolonged, soft sounds with delay suggest frequent diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Sounds:</strong> Short phrases with delayed sounds, frequent bowel sounds suggest diarrhea, numerous voiced issues lead to silence, with wind heat affecting the lungs.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>            Pulse Responses to Various Diseases</p>

<p><strong>Observation of Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Observe the child&#39;s complexion: the liver is represented by a blue hue, the heart by red, the spleen by yellow, the lungs by white, and the kidneys by black. If the face lacks yellow, it is untreatable. Spring is associated with a white complexion, summer with black, autumn with red, and winter with yellow—these are signs of imbalance.</p>
<p>First, differentiate the regions. The left cheek corresponds to the Azure Dragon linked to the liver, indicating excess in spring. The right cheek corresponds to the White Tiger linked to the lungs, indicating deficiency in autumn. </p>
<p>The forehead is prominent and connected to the fire of the heart; it should display summer colors: red signifies extreme heat, while blue indicates liver wind. A blue tint at the Yintang (third eye) suggests fear; red and white indicate disturbance from water and fire, and red indicates phlegm heat. If the Yintang connects to the tip of the nose with redness, it signifies accumulated heat in the Sanjiao (Triple Burner); if redness extends from the Yintang to the root of the nose, it indicates heat in the heart and small intestine, with possible issues in urination. Red from the root of the nose to the nasal column points to heat in the heart and stomach, leading to urinary difficulties. The lower face signifies the passive Yin of the kidneys and water.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>The chin corresponds to the winter color, indicating a deficiency of the kidneys. The color of the承浆 (Chengjiang) is blue; when eating, there may be shock, or restlessness leading to night crying. If there is excessive yellow, it indicates vomiting, while red signifies illness in the kidney qi. Redness at the corners of the jaw indicates lung heat. </p>
<p>The nose, located in the center of the face, corresponds to the four seasons; if the tip is red or yellow, there&#39;s no issue. The spleen relates to the lips. Red lips signify thirst. If the heart is bitten by roundworms, the lips will turn inward. The area between the nose and chin corresponds to the small intestine; it prefers a deep, long shape and dislikes being flat and full. A black color indicates diarrhea or dysentery leading to death. Generally, if the Five Peaks are red, it indicates heat; if pale white, it suggests deficiency.</p>
<p>The poem by Chen on the accumulation of cold and heat in the five organs states: &quot;Liver shock rises at the hairline, liver accumulation in the food storage. Liver cold shows blue-white lips, liver heat is at the eyebrows. Heart shock is at the glabella, heart accumulation is at the corners of the forehead. Heart cold appears at the solar region, heart heat shows on both cheeks. Spleen shock is at the hairline, spleen accumulation has yellow lips. Spleen cold is at the center of the eyebrows, spleen heat occurs at the solar point. Lung shock is at the hairline, lung accumulation matches the hairline. Lung cold is visible at the philtrum, lung heat appears at both jaws. Kidney shock is at the front of the ears, kidney accumulation shows in the eyelids. Kidney cold presents as purple at the forehead, kidney heat appears red in the food storage.&quot;</p>
<p>Red qi seen indicates excessive heat phlegm. The glabella belongs to the heart: red indicates heat phlegm, blue-black indicates shocked phlegm, while yellow and blue indicate wind phlegm. Blue color reveals shocked wind and palpitations. Black like coal can signify pain and adverse reactions; like orange, it indicates food damage, spleen deficiency, and vomiting or diarrhea.</p>
<p>The Right Taiyin (Lung) at the Wenwu platform is also marked in blue for food damage, yet can also indicate heat and spleen deficiency with vomiting or diarrhea. White signifies wasting; it represents cold, with lung qi being unbeneficial.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>Purple indicates intense heat.<br>Blackness signifies death.<br>Green around the mouth corners indicates difficulty in treatment, a state of fright and madness.<br>Black obscures the sun and is untreatable.<br>On the left temple, green suggests a light shock, while red indicates severe cold with nasal congestion, transforming into a fierce heat, and black-green signifies a buildup of milk.

<p>Liver qi leading to eye discharge and tears; spleen cold causing salivation to stagnate in the jaws. </p>
<p>A normal mouth is red; dryness indicates spleen heat, white signifies loss of blood, blue-yellow indicates accumulation of fright, and black signifies death. The face appears gaunt. If the abdomen is swollen and there is difficulty in breathing; if the eyebrows frequently frown, there will certainly be abdominal pain and much crying. </p>
<p>In chronic illness, red eyebrows indicate nighttime crying; purple suggests wind-heat, bright red indicates death, and wrinkled signifies dysentery. </p>
<p>If both cheeks appear blue-black, it indicates negative influence. </p>
<p>Yellow phlegm is substantial; red denotes fear-evoking wind, while bright red signifies damage from cold. </p>
<p>When the wind qi in both channels appears as yellow earth, it indicates inappropriateness; </p>
<p>Red in the wind channel suggests wind phlegm about to cause convulsions, whereas red in the air channel suggests wind with internal heat. </p>
<p>Black in the wind gate indicates hernia, while blue indicates fright. </p>
<p>Red indicates vomiting and diarrhea. </p>
<p>A square and smooth appearance is auspicious, while dullness is ominous. </p>
<p>The center and heavenly palace, along with the space between the eyebrows, are the command points; blue-black indicates fright and bad signs to avoid denting or sinking. </p>
<p>If the hand resembles an object, liver wind may arise; </p>
<p>Those who hold their heads with their hands are dead.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>Her face is like painted vermilion, her heart burns like fire. She loves warmth when sitting or lying down, and feels the chill of the wind; she feels cold when stretching or curling up, tormented by heat and restlessness. She has a large belly and small feet, her spleen desires to rest yet becomes ill; her eyes are wide and mouth agape, she appears in danger and is bound to perish. Alas! Of the five limbs, the head is supreme, only the spirit can be relied upon. </p>
<p>As for the illnesses of children, if one sees the eyes lacking brightness, the black pupils without movement, the eyelashes lacking luster, like a cat or fish’s eyes, or if both eyes are closed and the pupils dim, death may follow. If they appear dazed outwardly yet the spirit remains hidden within, life may continue. Children whose eyes are bright with black orbs are less likely to fall ill, while those with more white or yellowish pupils, or small ones, are weak and more prone to sickness. Red eyes indicate heat in the heart, pale red signifies weakness and heat in the heart, green indicates heat in the liver, light colors show liver deficiency, yellow suggests heat in the spleen, while lack of brightness denotes kidney deficiency, and cloudy whites point to lung heat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sound of a child&#39;s voice can vary in weight and tone. A light sound indicates weakness, while a heavy and murky sound suggests pain and wind. A loud cry signifies uncontrolled heat and desire. A hasty sound reveals fright, a muffled one indicates phlegm, a straining sound suggests cold, a choking sound signals obstructed breath, shortness of breath indicates suffocation, sneezing shows a cold or fright, and a deep, silent sound suggests heaviness; a murky, quiet sound indicates accumulation of illness, as does a child who is born and does not cry much, and those who cough lightly are likely to die young. </p>
<p>Crying can differ in dryness and wetness. A direct sound without tears indicates pain, continuous sounds without cessation and abundant tears suggest fright, a dry and harsh sound reveals difficulty in healing, while a hoarse and hurried voice indicates exposure to cold. At the onset of illness, one must first yawn.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>The liver governs emotions. A red face indicates wind-heat, a blue face signifies fright, a yellow face suggests spleen deficiency, and excessive swelling indicates internal heat. Mental unease points to qi heat, while a hoarse voice suggests wind injury. </p>
<p>When fire suddenly flares, it can shock the qi, leading to certain death. If symptoms arise at midnight, there are often mouth sores that require immediate attention. The coarse grains differ from refined ones, just as rough cloth differs from silk. It’s essential to discern internal conditions from external appearances; do not look for a sword by marking a boat.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Examination</strong></p>
<p>The forehead pulse can feel hot or cold; both indicate vomiting and gastrointestinal distress. If the index finger feels hot and the chest is full, it suggests unidentifiable heat causing breast discomfort. Heat above and cold below with internal heat requires careful observation, especially if mixed with fright, which is indicated by the middle finger. The index finger relates to wind and the three vital gates. </p>
<p>For men, the left side is yang and the right is yin, while for women, it is the opposite. However, both genders encompass yin and yang; therefore, both hands should be evaluated. The left hand corresponds to the heart and liver; the right hand to the lungs and spleen, allowing for flexible interpretation. A red line-like pattern on the left hand indicates heat and fright; a similar pattern on the right indicates spleen accumulation and fright. </p>
<p>Triangular patterns suggest lung heat, wind phlegm, and night crying. If there is no pulse at the wind gate, there is no illness; a pulse indicates mild disease; the qi gate signals severe illness; and at the life gate, a short, tiny red-yellow pulse with light external signs is not a cause for concern. However, if the three gates show a bluish-black mark with severe external signs, it indicates death. </p>
<p>The five colors require attention to the combination of red and yellow for stability.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>The five colors are red, yellow, purple, blue, and black. Due to the severity of illness, colors can change. For instance, when red and yellow are prominent, red can turn into purple; when red and purple are prominent, purple can turn into blue; when purple and blue are prominent, blue can turn into black; and when blue and black are prominent, pure black indicates an incurable condition. Moreover, the white color indicates a possible skin disease, while a dull yellow suggests spleen distress.</p>
<p>Pale red can be associated with cold or heat; deep blue may indicate fright or accumulation, especially in the four limbs. Bright red can indicate fright from water or fire-related creatures. A bright red hue may signal fright in humans. Green mixed with yellow can indicate fright from thunder. Either red or blue threads appearing straight may result from maternal dietary impacts. Purple or blue or black threads intertwined, appearing subtly as if they are coming and going, may suggest chronic spleen disturbances. Deep red rashes or sores indicate damage from a cold illness.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>Red fever, measles, and empty diarrhea.<br>Curved lines indicate halted eating with abdominal pain;<br>Crying excessively and inability to digest milk,<br>If the lines are many, it indicates disharmony of qi;<br>If chaotic, the illness has persisted;<br>If curved, it suggests abundant wind-heat.<br>Rough dark lines indicating severe wind and stubbornness.<br>Rough straight lines pointing to the nails suggest imminent wind and adverse conditions;<br>Lines as black as ink indicate difficulty in treatment.<br>Suspended needles for dark water heat,<br>Dark water wind-patterns indicate shock;<br>Qi-patterns show heat from dysentery,<br>Destiny patterns indicate shock to the person,<br>Often transmitting chronic spleen wind, untreated.

However, if the patterns bend outward like a bow and press against the nails, it is crucial not to attempt a reversal. If there are three lines like flowing pearls or grains of rice connected in two or three points, whether manifesting on the face or body, the condition is particularly critical.</p>
<p>The qi deficiency points inward, while the wind deficiency points outward; lateral left indicates injury from wind, and lateral right indicates injury from cold. The dual hooks and three bends indicate damage from cold stiffness, with a pulse chaotic like parasitic worms gathering. The gun-shaped phlegm heat causes seizures, while the dual-charactered food poison leads to difficult accumulation. For children aged three to five, check for breath on all three finger joints.</p>
<p>The floating and surging wind indicates high counts of surprise; the floating and sluggish may point to wind damage, and the surging tightness indicates cold damage. A tight pulse signifies serious cold accumulation; if the pulse is tight like a cord, it points to wind epilepsy, while a deep and slow pulse suggests difficulty in emulsification. Abdominal pain and tightness indicate significant blockage; if deep and rapid, think of cold in the bones. Long and tight pulses often suggest phlegm and wind in the diaphragm, while a tight pulse indicates disharmony of qi.</p>
<p>A rapid and tight pulse and signs of surprise lead to limb spasms, with a floating and surging pulse resembling fire at the stomach; a single thin and sallow pulse may indicate a gnawing condition. A deficiency leading to moisture suggests surprise, and while there is qi, it remains disharmonious. Surprise denotes a loss of the spirit&#39;s home. A hollow pulse may accompany severe diarrhea with blood in the stools. Fluctuations in the pulse correspond to shifting conditions, with a sluggish pulse indicating cold and vomiting without tidal heat. </p>
<p>Focal accumulation signifies a gathering of substances.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>The pulse at the front is greater and smaller at the back, indicating that the energy is blocked. If the size is uneven, it signifies malice. When the four conditions are full, there is much suffering and deep pain in the abdomen. Slippery injuries come from wetness and cold. The long strings reveal clearly contradictory signs. When it reaches five at night, it is often floating; by six, it becomes fine and distinct by day. Pure Yang at six signifies balance; five indicates deficiency, four indicates illness, three reveals detachment, while seven and eight indicate lighter ailments, and nine and ten indicate severity, with eleven and twelve leading to death. This is the profound teaching passed down by the sage.</p>
<p>As for the method for children’s pulses:</p>
<p>In children, the pulse is whole; floating and sinking are key. Floating is the exterior, sinking the interior, thus knowing its source. Sizes vary with smoothness; deficiency and firmness pace slowly. Each follows that of adults for verification and treatment.</p>
<p>Regarding the medicinal prescription:</p>
<p>Pediatrics was not recorded in the &quot;Suwen&quot;; it was Bian Que who first acknowledged children’s medicine. Shock and accumulation are the main issues; rashes and variola are especially peculiar. Children’s illnesses are similar to adults, but they often have more combinations of shock, accumulation, and rashes. For shock, treat with cooling, warmth, and urgency; cinnabar and dragon brain are lifesavers. For accumulation, dissolve, transform, and purge, starting with purple frost and white cakes. For wind and sensitivity, Qianghuo and Da Qing Gao should be boiled; for coughs with phlegm and wheezing, Tingniubai Bu pills are advisable. Raw rhinoceros, purple sunshine, and lianqiao decoction can relieve heat; Tianyi Guanyin silver-white powder is good for adjusting weak stomach and spleen. Ah! Better to treat ten men than one woman. Better to treat ten women than one child.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p>
<h3>General Discussion on Child Health</h3>
<p>The text states: For children aged six years and younger, there is little recorded in classical texts about diseases that are difficult to treat, and there are no established details on this matter. Specifically, this refers to infants who are unable to speak; if they are sick, there is no way to inquire about their suffering, hence the lack of recorded information. Those who can speak are able to communicate their conditions. Is it conceivable that a child over six years old cannot speak? The only ones who cannot speak are infants aged one or two. Thus, the ancients indicated that those who are unable to speak are very young. When ill, their skin is not fully developed, and it is difficult to distinguish their condition; symptoms may fluctuate and intertwine, with subtle energy and blood. Accurate diagnosis through palpation is indeed challenging. Hence, observing their physical appearance and correlating it with symptoms can reveal the source of the illness. The method of observation requires a calm demeanor and focused intention, avoiding distractions caused by emotions. One must not observe the child when they are crying or just waking up, as their appearance may be misleading. Ideally, observations should take place after the hour of Chen (7 AM - 9 AM) and before the hour of Si (1 PM - 3 PM), in summer when it’s not too hot, and in winter when it’s not too warm, ensuring that the external appearance is unclouded and internal energy is relaxed, making it suitable for clear observation. The &quot;Holy Wisdom Classic&quot; states: Knowledgeable individuals can discern the balance of strong and weak, brave and timid, observing their states of fullness and emptiness, and understanding the implications of cold and warmth, balancing yin and yang, determining the severity of illness and treatment urgency according to symptoms, so there&#39;s no need to struggle with difficult cases. The discussions are extensive and complex, making it hard to grasp fully. Now, let’s extract the relevant points and organize them accordingly.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a></p>
<h3>Death and Life Colors of the Face</h3>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: If a patient has a yellow face with blue eyes, a yellow face with red eyes, or a yellow face with black eyes, they will not die. The &quot;Shengji Jing&quot; says: The spleen is the true foundation; when the face is yellow, it must be due to the exterior manifestation of true qi. However, if the face is blue with red eyes, blue with white eyes, blue with black eyes, black with white eyes, or red with blue eyes, they are all signs of imminent death, as the color of the spleen is absent, indicating that true qi has already been exhausted.</p>
<h3>Death Colors from the &quot;Jinkui&quot;</h3>
<p>For young children, if they have a completely black face, or if black surrounds the mouth and extends to the eyes or the area between the eyebrows, or if there&#39;s darkness in the middle of the face, all are signs of death. If there is a blue discoloration extending across the face and into the eyes or ears, it indicates death. Furthermore, if the eyes lack brightness and there are objects resembling a horizontal red needle within them, this signifies death.</p>
<h3>Death Colors from the &quot;Wai Tai&quot;<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a></h3>
<p>For any child who is ill, if there is a blue-black color on the face resembling a veil, stretching from the hairline to the center of the forehead, regardless of the severity of symptoms, death occurs within sixty days; if it reaches the tip of the nose, death occurs within one month; if it reaches the philtrum, death occurs within ten days; if it covers the entire face, death occurs on the same day.</p>
<p>Regarding the color on the nose:</p>
<p>The &quot;Seng Ji Jing&quot; states: A blue color at the tip of the nose indicates cold in the abdomen; black indicates water vapor; white indicates lack of blood; yellow indicates cold in the chest; red indicates the presence of wind; vibrant color indicates retained fluid.</p>
<p>Regarding the color in the eyes:</p>
<p>Red indicates heat in the heart; light red indicates empty heat; blue indicates heat in the liver; pale indicates liver deficiency; yellow indicates heat in the spleen; a non-spirited color indicates kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>Patterns and signs in various places:</p>
<p>At the back of the ear, above the complete bone, if there are blue veins like lines in three or two paths, and if lying down is uncomfortable, this indicates a chronic illness. One should puncture to let the blood out as a minor treatment. If it bursts on its own, it indicates an impending death. On the flesh above the fish joint of the left thumb, if the tendons are blue-black, this indicates cold in the stomach; red-yellow indicates heat; mixed red-blue-black indicates both cold and heat; if short and blue, it indicates a lack of energy. </p>
<p>At the junction of the fingers, between the thumb and the index finger, above the tiger&#39;s mouth, if there are lines of tendons, observe the color and whether they are straight or curved to determine the illness. If the lines are straight, it signifies fright; if curved, it indicates injury; if hidden, it indicates wind; external curves indicate cold; internal curves indicate food.</p>
<p>A verse states:<br>&quot;In the tiger&#39;s mouth, if the blue lines are straight, know that there is fright in the limbs.<br>Black signifies the water element, red indicates fire soaring high.<br>Light red results from fright, while curved purple suggests injury might lie.<br>Cold outside, and food within, the hidden signs determine the winds arise.&quot;<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br>When growing older, diseases must be taken seriously; when small and short, one can find peace. Just observe where the hands cross, and the signs of illness will reveal their truth or falsehood. The three sections on the second finger are called the &quot;Three Passes.&quot; For children, observe the left for boys and the right for girls, with eight types of veins and patterns to verify their ailments, known as the &quot;Eight Pieces of Brocade.&quot;</p>
<p>The shape resembling a fishbone indicates initial fright; in the Qi Pass, it signifies strong heat with vomiting and diarrhea; in the Wind Pass, it represents the onset of fright; in the Life Pass, severe fright is difficult to treat. A song says: &quot;When shaped like a fishbone, it&#39;s initial fright, the whole body looks green like soup. Vomiting and diarrhea, restlessness as such, harmonizing the intestines and calming the Qi brings clarity.&quot;</p>
<p>The shape resembling a hanging needle indicates diarrhea and dysentery; in the Qi Pass, it signifies cold damage with vomiting and diarrhea; in the Wind Pass, it relates to shock caused by wind; in the Life Pass, it indicates lingering fright with severe symptoms. A song says: &quot;When shaped like a hanging needle, diarrhea is abundant, shock with body heat definitely disturbs harmony. If this illness transforms into chronic fright, the Life Pass already indicates a serious illness.&quot;<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>The shape of the character &quot;water&quot; is associated with shock to the lungs. In the realm of respiration, it relates to phlegm, cough, and virtuous accumulations; in the realm of wind, it corresponds to shock, wheezing, and phlegm; in the life-domain, it leads to distress without remedy. The song says:<br>&quot;The form resembles the character for water, the lung is shocked,<br>With hidden accumulations passed down, the complexion turns blue.<br>There’s phlegm above the diaphragm that needs treatment,<br>If the life-domain is bypassed, there is no tranquility.&quot;  </p>
<p>The shape of the character &quot;乙,&quot; also called the middle curve, is associated with shock from food. In the realm of respiration, it governs injury from food, vomiting, and diarrhea; in the realm of wind, it corresponds to transformations of wind. The shape of &quot;乙&quot; pertains to the liver, which is in conflict with the spleen; in the life-domain, it leads to chronic spleen wind, with no remedy. The song says:<br>&quot;The form resembles the character for &#39;乙,&#39; the cause of illness is the liver,<br>Eyes slow to startle, weeping, and twitching.<br>Cold accumulations lead to injury, causing transformations,<br>Chronic spleen wind has already passed through three domains.&quot;  </p>
<p>The shape of the departing snake signifies internal fullness and external emptiness, while the shape of the arriving snake signifies external fullness and internal emptiness. When both snake shapes are present, they indicate emptiness both inside and out; these variations are all related to the crooked insect. Additionally, the crooked snake in the realm of respiration signifies damp accumulation; in the realm of wind, it signifies effort and shock; in the life-domain, it remains without remedy.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>The song says: The shape like a coiled snake indicates a deep-seated illness, with spleen accumulation and labor leading to fright. If one has not passed the three gates, it is advisable to treat early; if passed, do not discuss further. The elder presents a bow shape, the younger a ring shape, both signify accumulation. In the air gate, there is regurgitation of heat; in the wind gate, extreme emaciation; at the life gate, untreatable.</p>
<p>The song says: The circular arc shape with yellowed qi, craving earth is common. This illness requires early attention from a skilled physician; if it has reached the three gates, then life is endangered.</p>
<p>Disordered patterns indicate pain from parasites. In the air gate, it signifies disharmony with qi, with accumulations of parasites that consume living organisms; in the wind gate, it indicates pain from parasitic bites in the abdomen; at the life gate, the illness is extremely difficult to cure.</p>
<p>The song says: The chaotic patterns denote parasites; they cry out day and night without restraint. Seeking divine help yields no response; calm the parasites and remove the accumulation to attain health.</p>
<p>The pearl-shaped condition, regardless of whether seen above or below the three gates, indicates death. The song says: Flowing pearls signal a dead condition; no need for medicine as this is an incurable illness. If seen past the three gates, do not hope; arrange for future matters without doubt.</p>
<p>General summary of various patterns:</p>
<p>Initial signs of fishbone distress, hanging needles cause much diarrhea. Water patterns alarm the lungs; similarly, it misrepresents the liver. Curved parasites indicate illness; the ring bow confirms it. Disordered patterns indicate severe parasitic bites; flowing pearls signify the illness has become chronic.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br><strong>Various Signs of Death</strong></p>
<p>When sick and struggling, sweat emerges, like pearls yet not flowing; hair on the head stands upright, lips dry and parched, cold air from the mouth and nose, the head and feet touch; lying down as if bound, limbs droop and hang, hands and feet are cold.</p>
<p><strong>Song of the Death Signs of Tong Zhenzi</strong></p>
<p>The lips are sunken, dry; the eyes stare straight; cold air in the mouth; lying as if in a daze. The body is stiff, hands and feet soft; hands are cold, head bowed, no hope for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Theory</strong></p>
<p>All children inherit, organs, Qi, blood, nourishment, and form; though born, all are complete. However, before speaking, during the changing process, the blood and Qi are not yet filled, the skin is not firm, the muscles and bones are not strong, and the pulse pattern is not yet formed. If there is illness, it is difficult to diagnose or inquire about. Hence, the sages say that childhood illnesses are hard to treat because there is no firm basis to rely on. Thus, it is established to observe the appearance and color. A child is born after five hundred seventy-six days; once the changes are complete, Qi and blood nourish, spirit is different, muscles and bones are strong, pulse is whole, and then one can diagnose and inquire. Those who think a child&#39;s pulse differs from that of adults do not grasp the fundamental aspect of diagnosis and treatment. The pulse&#39;s length, shortness, slowness, and quickness depend on the form, and not strictly on numbers. The classics say that a child&#39;s pulse is often like a sparrow&#39;s fight, focusing on the three regions as the main part; if the pulse is small, the little and fine ones are flat. Many schools of thought have much to say; here I select what is appropriate. Master Sun said: A child&#39;s pulse is indeed difficult to differentiate between exterior and interior.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>Today, summarizing its main points, it can be condensed into a few lines. The overarching song states:</p>
<p>When a child is ill, one must feel the pulse,<br>A single finger at three positions determines the breath.<br>A child&#39;s arms are short, making it difficult to place three fingers to distinguish the three positions, hence only one finger is used for diagnosis.  </p>
<p>Floating pulse signifies wind, and when acquired in autumn, it is considered balanced;<br>At other times, it indicates damage from wind-cold, with symptoms of headache and fever,<br>Sometimes fever at night with coolness during the day, coughing and sneezing, nasal congestion with clear discharge, vomiting and not eating.<br>The song says: Floating indicates wind in autumn’s balance,<br>While otherwise, wind-cold causes headaches and eye pains.<br>Fever peaks at night with clear nasal discharge, with frequent sneezing, coughing, and vomiting.</p>
<p>The surging pulse indicates heat, and when acquired in summer, it is balanced;<br>At other times, it signifies wind-heat overwhelming, with the body feeling hot and robust, ulcers, and bleeding.<br>The song says: Surging indicates alignment with summer&#39;s harmony,<br>While outside conditions cause heat and robustness to flourish.<br>Wind obstruction may cause shock or swelling, sometimes leading to significant bleeding.</p>
<p>The rapid pulse indicates shock, and when acquired in spring, it is balanced;<br>At other times, it suggests seizure or convulsion from wind.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>The rapid pulse, when small, often accompanies frequent sleep disturbances, direct gazes with fear, night sweats at odd times, teeth grinding, and slight wheezing. When the pulse is large and rapid, convulsions will occur within one or two days. A verse says: &quot;Rapid signifies a startled condition; the spring days are prolonged, while at other times, a small rapid pulse brings sudden disturbances. Wheezing with a direct gaze and frequent tongue protrusion, a large rapid pulse leads to convulsions and calamities.&quot;</p>
<p>A slow and deep pulse indicates deficiency and cold; in winter, this is considered normal, but at other times, it signifies weakness of the spleen and stomach, leading to diarrhea, soft stools, prolapse of the rectum, and persistent vomiting of dysentery, resulting in gradual emaciation, which may cause spleen deficiency or consumption. A verse says: &quot;A slow and deep pulse is calm in winter; at other times, it indicates weakness of the spleen and stomach. Diarrhea and soft stools lead to prolapse, with vomiting, dysentery, emaciation, and consumption.”</p>
<p>A full pulse denotes stagnation; experienced throughout the four seasons, it indicates food injury and accumulation, with a pale face, abdominal distention, heat and thirst, vomiting, and abdominal pain. A verse says: &quot;A full pulse speaks of food injury and accumulation; strong heat, abdominal distention, and dryness in the hair. Vomiting and dysentery with abdominal pain may indicate a mass; through all seasons, it presents similarly.&quot;<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Precious Mirror&quot;:</strong> The pulses of the four seasons are: Spring is represented by the string (xian), Summer by the flooding (hong), Autumn by the floating (fu), and Winter by the sinking (chen). Each season’s pulse is slow, and one must observe the ruling and ministerial states to diagnose the illness. For instance, if in Spring the pulse is string-like and floating, the disease is in the superficial layers, indicating Yang and conformity, hence easy to treat. But if it is string-like and sinking, the illness resides deeper in the organs, indicating Yin and opposition, thus difficult to treat. I followed this pattern for the other times.</p>
<p><strong>Wang&#39;s Pulse Song:</strong> After feeding, if a child vomits and has a chaotic pulse with no concerns, in times of tightness and cold, a slow pulse indicates the inability to digest milk. Tight, rapid, and weak pulses also lead to suffering; excess phlegm and Qi disturbances provoke wind. In cases of dysentery with urgent abdominal pain, a large floating pulse points to the pathway of the source.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Pulse Classics&quot; states:</strong> In children, a rapid pulse is labeled as fast; when it reaches seven or eight beats per breath, it&#39;s considered normal. Fewer beats indicate deficiency, and excessive beats indicate excess.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;True Communication Song&quot;:</strong> In children aged three to five, one must observe that the breathing rate should be around eight breaths. Nine signifies discomfort, and ten indicates distress; variations in length and size indicate external disturbances.</p>
<p>It continues: A tight pulse in children indicates wind-related convulsions; a sinking pulse requires knowledge as it suggests difficulty with digestion. Sharp abdominal pain with a tight string-like pulse indicates severity, while a sinking and rapid pulse reveals heat residing within the bones.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p>
<h3>Signs of Death in Pulse</h3>
<p>If the pulse comes three times and then stops without being felt, it indicates death. If the pulse comes quickly like a taut bowstring and rigid, it indicates death. If the pulse appears suddenly and is not felt, it indicates death. </p>
<p>The song says: &quot;Three beats and then stop, if it does not come, it is ominous; quick and hard like the bowstring, energy is in the bow. If it arrives suddenly and then cannot be sensed, all are signs of death, according to the lineage.&quot;</p>
<h3>Various Illness Pulses</h3>
<p>A taut pulse indicates wind and cold.<br>A rapid pulse indicates malaria.<br>A tense pulse indicates disharmony of Qi, or an external invasion.<br>A quick pulse indicates distress.<br>A rapid pulse indicates fright or seizures. A floating pulse indicates wind.<br>A floating and tense pulse indicates wind stroke.<br>A floating and large pulse indicates severe cold injury.<br>A floating and weak pulse indicates night sweats.<br>A floating and rapid pulse indicates wind heat.<br>A hidden pulse indicates Qi stagnation.<br>A slow and thin pulse indicates cold, or unprocessed milk.<br>A weak or slippery pulse indicates weakness or fright.<br>A weak and slippery pulse indicates chronic fright and wind.<br>A weak and tense pulse indicates hidden heat.<br>A heavy pulse indicates accumulation.<br>A sinking and rapid pulse indicates cold between the bones, while another view suggests heat between the bones.<br>A sinking and slow pulse indicates deficiency and cold.<br>A sinking and relaxed pulse indicates food injury.<br>A firm and tense pulse indicates accumulation.<br>A firm pulse suggests intestinal blockage.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>The heart pulse is full and broad while the liver pulse is small and urgent, indicating fright and convulsions. A rapid and small heart pulse indicates consumption and strangury. A rapid pulse indicates heat. A pulse that rises and falls smoothly at the wrist indicates fright. An uneven pulse of different sizes at the wrist indicates transformation or steaming.</p>
<p>If the left wrist has no pulse, accompanied by heart pain, internal heat, vomiting, oral ulcers, possible coughing, a hard voice in the throat, and sweating on the head, this is caused by a wet nurse consuming cold food affecting the infant. Moreover, a disordered pulse will lead to vomiting. </p>
<p>If the right wrist has no pulse, with fullness in the chest, shortness of breath, vomiting, belching, and sounds in the throat, this is from a wet nurse carrying the child and exposing them to wind and cold.</p>
<p>A pulse that feels like a bird pecking and is tense indicates wind convulsions. A pulse that varies in size and does not follow regularity indicates adverse signs.</p>
<p>For children, a pulse that flies indicates the breath rate: eight beats per breathing cycle is normal, nine indicates illness, and ten indicates fatigue. A weak pulse in children signifies a weak condition, while a strong pulse indicates a strong illness. Hence, a rapid fright pulse is urgent, while a slow yearning pulse is feeble.</p>
<p><strong>On the Essentials of Treating Infants</strong></p>
<p>Illness in children is most difficult to treat, as they cannot articulate or discern right from wrong. It requires careful observation and assessment, listening to sounds and observing colors to probe the underlying condition.</p>
<p><strong>Listening to Sounds</strong></p>
<p>A light sound indicates weak energy, while a heavy sound with pain suggests a mixture of wind. A long sigh symbolizes stagnant heat, and groaning indicates imminent death. Loud cries indicate excessive fright, while shaking the head suggests a loss of spirit. Not speaking means the heart’s path is blocked; thus, there is no need to use medicine to force a remedy.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br><strong>Song of External Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>A warm belly and cold feet indicate a definite injury; warm feet and a warm forehead indicate a wind invasion. A cold belly and warm feet suggest shock from movement; when sores and rashes appear, the area behind the ears reddens.</p>
<p><strong>Song of Untreated Diseases</strong></p>
<p>A white film covers the eyes, red veins run through the center. Pulling the hand tight, it becomes rigid like a bow. The fish&#39;s mouth opens frequently, the crow&#39;s voice resembles teeth grinding. Wanting to cry but not producing tears, when cries do come, they are soundless. Thick phlegm sounds in the throat, startled gasps echo in the abdomen. Dysentery heat gathers with abundant pus, while injuries from cold show no sweat. Prolonged diarrhea leads to a loss of spirit, extreme thirst leads to dry skin. Wheezing is forceful and coarse, the wind topples the spine.</p>
<p><strong>Song of Life and Death at First Sight</strong></p>
<p>How to discern the pulse of a young child? Fourteen distinct signs are very clear. Holding them, the body is not warm (blood is cut off); four limbs feel heavy, crying sounds like a crow (stomach is cut off). The nose is dry and black, eyes exhibit a fixed stare (spleen is cut off); crying without tears, drooling appears blue (liver is cut off). Eyebrows are drawn up, fingernails are black; the fontanel swells, suddenly forming a pit (tendons are cut off). The mouth bites people as the fish&#39;s mouth gasps; feet stay straight, the belly is large, blue veins appear (qi is cut off, tendons do not retract). Looking up seems like gazing at something high, long sighs exhale dark markings (blood does not envelop the pulse). Not able to retain milk, the tongue falls out (bones and heart are cut off); lips do not cover teeth, eye sockets are sunken (spleen is cut off). Frequent dysentery leads to black, dark blood; convulsions resemble a smile yet lack emotion (heart is cut off). Regardless of wealth or rank, or male or female, out of ten people treated, not one survives.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br><strong>Song of Observing Colors</strong></p>
<p>Red and purple indicate heat from the wind; blue and black suggest deep illness. Excessive whiteness shows weakness of vitality, while yellow indicates damage from diet. Red lips signify thirst and diarrhea; a bluish hue foretells impending death. A dark face is hard to save; a skilled physician must examine closely.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Blood and Qi</strong></p>
<p>The heart is the master of blood, and the liver is the organ of blood; the lungs are the master of qi, and the kidneys are the organ of qi. Blood originates in the heart and is stored in the liver; qi originates in the lungs and is stored in the kidneys. If there is bloody diarrhea, use Wu Ling and Meng Dong to act on the heart’s intent, and Ba Dou and Da Huang to eliminate stagnation; if the illness persists, the blood&#39;s reservoirs cannot nourish, supplementing with Gui and Xiong can stop the diarrhea. If there is coughing and wheezing, use Zhi, Ju, Ginger, and Cinnamon to regulate qi, and Nan Xing and Ban Xia to relieve phlegm; if it still does not rise or fall, qi&#39;s reservoirs cannot be secured, supplementing with Ren Shen and Qi can restore qi to the source. There are exterior and interior illnesses, and treatment has its priorities. The methods of the heart are profound and not to be transmitted. The external corresponds to the symptom, while the internal corresponds to the root. For external pathogens, treat the symptoms, which must be dispersed; for internal injuries, address the root, supplementing and regulating. Urgent cases require symptom treatment, while slower cases can focus on the root. Treating both root and symptom ensures no harm.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>In cases of deficiency heat, the body feels warm. The complexion is pale, the breath is cool, the palms are not hot, both ends are unobstructed, with frequent diarrhea and urination, spontaneous sweating occurs, and one should not attack heat but rather should use warming supplements. In cases of excess heat, the face is red, breathing is heavy, there is thirst and swollen lips, difficulty in lifting clothing, frequent crying and shouting; externally sweating should be induced, while internally purging is appropriate. If the stools are yellow, hard, and dense, with a yellow face and red cheeks, dry lips and a dry mouth, both externally and internally are hot. If there is benefit, do not supplement, for fear that heat will re-emerge. If residual heat does not subside, there is no need for excessive concern. Use only cooling medicines; eliminate heat to prevent cold from arising. Remove heat to address heat, and for deficiency, replenish deficiency. Observe and treat as appropriate, without fixation in treatment.</p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Form and Qi</strong></p>
<p>Observing form and Qi requires careful attention. First clarify the parts and closely examine the balance of excess and deficiency. Use medicine as necessary to see miraculous effects. A red, hot, and dry forehead indicates wind disturbance. A blue hue at the glabella warns of sudden changes due to fright. If there’s sudden redness and darkness, it signals sinister influence. A blue hue at the root of the nose points to double fright. If redness persists, it suggests contention of thirst. A red lip with severe illness indicates one should not treat. If the eyes are dull, it is contraindicated to act. Unmarked hands and feet, with eyes closed and mouth open. A straight hairline with hoarse voice indicates difficult treatment. If the liver lacks Qi, it is best if kidney water is clear; if the lung is bright and radiant, there is fear of fiery cheeks. Red lips signal thirst, and red cheeks indicate excess surprise. A furrowed brow indicates parental concern.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a></p>
<h3>General Discussion on Children&#39;s Illnesses</h3>
<p>In ancient times, children&#39;s illnesses were referred to as the &quot;mute category&quot; because their inability to communicate makes it difficult to assess their condition. Thus, it was said one would rather treat ten men than one woman, and rather treat ten women than one child, highlighting the difficulty in treating children. However, in my view, among the three, children are actually the easiest to treat. Why do I say this? It is because children&#39;s ailments, if not caused by external wind and cold, stem from internal issues such as dietary imbalance, leading to conditions like convulsions, vomiting, diarrhea, and various fevers; they are merely a few types. Moreover, children&#39;s organs are clear and responsive, and if one can correctly ascertain their fundamental issue and address it, a single medicine can cure them, unlike the chronic and stubborn ailments often found in men and women, which is why I deem it easy. </p>
<p>People often say it is difficult because of the challenge in distinguishing their conditions; I maintain it is easy because of its treatability. If one misidentifies the issue, then indeed, it becomes difficult. However, the method of diagnosis is simply to discern the symptoms of exterior and interior, cold and heat, deficiency and excess. Once the six factors are clearly understood, how can treatment be difficult? Thus, for any external pathogen, there must be exterior symptoms without interior signs, such as fever, headache, tightness without sweating, or conditions similar to wind constriction. For internal injuries, there would be only interior symptoms without exterior signs, such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pains, and bloating, or conditions like convulsions and accumulations. Heat must present with heat symptoms, such as extreme heat, agitation, and the presence of abscesses. Cold must display cold symptoms, such as clear diarrhea, absence of heat, no agitation, and a preference for warmth.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>The four conditions presented here signify the signs of cold and heat, which are quite easy to distinguish. However, among these four, it is the concepts of &quot;emptiness&quot; and &quot;fullness&quot; that are of utmost importance. There is the emptiness and fullness of physical appearance, the emptiness and fullness of sound, and the emptiness and fullness of pulse and breath. For instance, there are differences between individuals with strong and weak constitutions; there are distinctions between those with reddish complexions and those with pale or greenish ones; there is a variance between vigorous voices and timid, short ones; and there are differences between smooth, strong pulses and weak, thin ones. Therefore, it is essential to introspect on the pulse condition, externally observe the physical appearance and energy, and thoroughly assess the illness. By considering these factors with careful examination, how could one then find it difficult to ascertain emptiness and fullness? If there is indeed fullness or signs of heat, treatment must be directed toward the root cause.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>Indeed, the method for treating symptoms should be precise, straightforward, and light, suitable for the condition at hand. When a disease presents itself, one must not disturb the body&#39;s vital energy; this is the skill of a master. If one only sees superficial appearances, they should not rashly attack or consume resources arbitrarily. If what one sees is not genuine, it is not advisable to hastily eliminate the symptoms, as it may also be harmless. It is important to realize that a child, with a delicate body and undeveloped energy and blood, has fragile organs; even slight injuries or impairments can lead to significant decline, and a mistake in treatment can be unbearable for them. How much worse would it be for them otherwise? Furthermore, without nurturing the natural vitality, and only knowing how to exploit it, will lead to immediate harm and lifelong weakness. This is truly lamentable. All of this genuinely seeks the fundamental path and is indeed the essential foundation in pediatric medicine. Though it may seem unremarkable when discussed, the ignorance of many is vast, which is why I emphasize this toward the beginning of my writing. However, without keen observation, it is truly insufficient to speak on these matters—this is what makes it difficult.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br><strong>Observations on Life and Death</strong></p>
<p>To observe children, sound should be prioritized, followed by color. Generally, a clear and bright sound indicates life, while a muffled sound suggests illness, and silence indicates a lack of longevity. If a child suddenly cries out loudly without apparent illness, one must closely examine their body for potential sores or toxins, which should be treated immediately. </p>
<p>If the umbilical cord has no blood, the child is likely alive; a silver-white cord indicates life. A short, swollen purple cord, after being cut, may be safe if the purple blood is pressed out. A wide forehead indicates longevity. A black and open sutural line suggests longevity. If a child is born resembling a water bubble, this is a bad sign. </p>
<p>A face that is slightly yellow indicates good fortune. If born with a powdery white and floral appearance, it surely indicates death from umbilical wind.<br>If born with loose skin and thin flesh, and then gains weight significantly after five or six days, this also suggests a risk of umbilical wind. If born with skin that is not smooth, the child will die. </p>
<p>Crying without sound indicates death. Crying without tears indicates death. A tongue that resembles pig liver indicates death. Purple markings at the corners of the mouth resembling shrimp whiskers indicate death. </p>
<p>Thick and long hair suggests life; fine and soft, non-releasing hair indicates death. If the male genitalia do not appear, the child will die. If the scrotum does not retract, or if it is white or red, the child will die. </p>
<p>A child without an anal opening will die. [Note: There are cases today where this can be treated. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot; records therapeutic methods, detailing medical cases related to fetal conditions. Medical practitioners should thoroughly investigate both internal and external treatments in such cases.] If the flesh on the buttocks does not develop, the child will die.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>Those whose flesh does not develop will not live long.<br>Those with a pale face will die young.<br>Those with a short and dark umbilical cord will die young.<br>Those born entirely silver-white will die young.<br>Those who are born with teeth are greatly ominous; they will injure their parents, and if not, they will harm themselves.<br>Those who, without being wrapped, urinate immediately after birth will kill their parents and squander family wealth, living a life of toil and hardship.  </p>
<p>Regarding pulse diagnosis:</p>
<p>When a child’s form is complete and meridians are fully developed, as soon as they are born, their pulse can be discerned. Thus, the discussion of deficiency and excess states: if an infant has a weak, suspended pulse and warm hands and feet, they will live; if cold, they will die. If an infant suffers from wind-heat and has wheezing and loud breathing, with a strong, large pulse, if it is slow, they will live; if rapid, they will die. This is the basis of Xuānqí’s diagnosis of children, which always emphasizes the pulse and combines it with symptom interpretation. In works such as the &quot;Water Mirror Classic&quot; and &quot;Complete Guide to Young Hearts,&quot; it is stated that for children above three years old, one should observe the pulse in relation to the Tiger Mouth (thumb), and the Yin (liver) and Chen (spleen) positions based on wind and vital conditions. Among these observations, it is stated that a pulse starting at the Yin position and not reaching the Mao position is easy to treat; if it connects to the Mao position, it is difficult to treat; if Yin invades Mao or Mao excessively invades Chen, the chance of saving them is one in ten. </p>
<p>Such remarks should only be applied in critical situations to discern fortune and misfortune. Furthermore, different colors are associated with various ailments: purple indicates wind, red signifies febrile illness, green represents fright, white denotes malnutrition, and so on, including specific colors for various fright scenarios. However, can such simple color codes really distinguish these conditions accurately? This is the utmost folly—relying on such superficial observations is absurd.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>In today&#39;s pediatric examinations, there is seldom any method that does not rely on this framework; they do not understand the pulse and speak without any basis. If one were to inquire whether their hearts indeed possess any definitive insights, the answer would be uncertain, yet they wish to use children as subjects for experimentation, which is truly lamentable. Therefore, in diagnosing children, since their speech is unclear, it is all the more essential to prioritize the pulse, while also considering shape, color, and sound, ensuring a thorough approach. However, the pulse of children is not as varied as that of adults; one must observe the four aspects of strength, weakness, tension, and urgency in the pulse, as these are the key points for children. The strength and weakness can reveal vacuity and fullness, while tension and urgency can indicate the presence of evil or righteousness. Once these four aspects are clear, it matters not the various symptoms, but rather align the pulse with the illness and consider the causes behind these four aspects—this way, one will find an abundant source of knowledge and encounter truth in all cases. Further distinguishing with sound and color provides even more certainty; hence, how can one escape scrutiny? This is the most lively and ingenious method of thought. If one were to rely solely on a single pulse to determine a disease, the disease could still encompass various pulses, where the genuine and the false could intermingle, leading to a precarious conclusion that is hard to substantiate. Nevertheless, the method must not be discarded; one must carefully discern and choose those that possess sound reasoning.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br><strong>Sound</strong></p>
<p>Sound is produced by breath; when breath is robust, the sound is strong, and when breath is weak, the sound is timid. Therefore, to discern the fullness or emptiness of breath, one must first consider sound. As stated in various sections of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;: when there is speech that is faint, yet continues all day, this indicates a depletion of breath; if one says there is excess in the sea of chi, and feels a fullness in the chest with flushed face, then if the sea of chi is insufficient, the breath is too weak to speak; it is said that when the heart&#39;s chi is deficient, one feels sadness, while when sufficient, one cannot stop laughing; when the hand&#39;s lesser yin is deficient, one cannot speak; when there is internal depletion leading to loss of voice, this indicates kidney deficiency. Hua Yuanhua says: the yang state is often talkative, while the yin condition is silent; those who talk a lot are easier to treat, while the silent are difficult to nourish. All of this distinguishes between the fullness and emptiness of sound, thus the sages discern emotions through sound, understanding everything. This is the study of sound, which should not be neglected.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br><strong>Colors</strong></p>
<p>The discussion on the subtle essence states: The refined five colors are the manifestations of qi. Red should resemble the brightness of white with a tinge of vermilion, not like ochre. White should look like goose feathers, not like salt; blue should be like the hue of a deep azure disk, not like indigo; yellow should appear like the golden hue wrapped in fine cloth, not like yellow earth; black should resemble the color of lacquer, not like dark mud. The subtle manifestations of the five colors can be seen, but their longevity is brief.</p>
<p>The essential text on jade tablets states: If one&#39;s complexion is pale and the face appears detached, it signifies that one may die within a hundred days. The appearance of color is influenced by position: above signifies rebellion, below signifies compliance. For women, the right side signifies rebellion, the left side signifies compliance; for men, the left side signifies rebellion, the right side signifies compliance.</p>
<p>The piece on the five colors states: How do the five colors relate to the organs? It is said that blue and black indicate pain, yellow and red indicate heat, and white indicates cold; these are known as the five organs. Furthermore, when discussing illness in relation to color, the answer is:<br>If the color is dull and bright, it indicates severity; if a certain color rises, the illness increases; if the color descends like clouds dispersing, the illness is easing.</p>
<p>The piece on the channels states: In diagnosing the channels, if the pulse is blue, it indicates cold and pain; if red, it indicates heat. If there is cold in the stomach, the network at the base of the hand will often be blue. If there is heat in the stomach, the network at the base of the hand will be red. If it is violently black, it indicates a lingering affliction.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>The presence of red, black, and blue indicates the cold and hot energies. A short blue hue signifies a deficiency of energy. Generally, examining color relates significantly to the energies: predominantly blue or white indicates a deficiency of heat, reflecting an underlying Yin disorder; while yellow and red indicate an abundance of heat, suggesting a Yang excess. </p>
<p>Blue signifies wind energy, relates to liver disorders, and reflects the Yin deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, leads to abdominal pain, may indicate sudden fright affecting the heart and gallbladder energy, and suggests a possibility of convulsive states; one should examine the combined colors to differentiate between acute and chronic conditions.</p>
<p>White signifies energy deficiency, and in serious cases, energy collapse. It represents an absence of fire and indicates insufficiency of the spleen and lungs. White with blue indicates chronic fright and issues related to diarrhea affecting the large and small intestines.</p>
<p>Red signifies fire, phlegm heat, and conditions of exogenous heat causing signs of disturbance, thirst, irritability, obstruction, and Yang disorder related to shortness of breath, as well as indications of sores, ulcers, and rashes.</p>
<p>Black is associated with water, indicating coldness and Yin energy, showing reversal of flow and extreme pain. Deep black indicates a critical condition.</p>
<p>Yellow signifies accumulation, masses, spleen disorders, distension, and splenic ailments. Yellow accompanied by white suggests cold and weakness of the spleen, indicative of energy deficiency and lack of spirit. Yellow with blue indicates deficiency causing diarrhea and chronic spleen wind; yellow with red relates to heat in the spleen.</p>
<p>Bright red or fluctuating redness in the cheeks indicates a facade of Yang, showing true weakness of Yin. This does not align with conditions of Yang excess and should not be equated with manifestations of heat and redness.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p>
<h3>Medical Principles for Treating Children</h3>
<p>Diseases in children are often hard to detect, but their root causes generally have specific origins. Therefore, those who practice medicine must first observe the innate qualities of the parents, with a particular emphasis on the mother&#39;s condition. If the mother has a lot of internal heat, the child will likely have heat-related issues; if the mother is cold, the child may have cold-related problems; if the mother’s spleen and kidneys are deficient, the child will exhibit similar deficiencies. Common symptoms such as soft bones, delayed walking, late teething, slow speech, a wide fontanel, malnutrition, and diarrhea often stem from the mother&#39;s condition. Although both parents contribute to the child&#39;s traits, the mother&#39;s influence is more immediate, while the father&#39;s is more distant. If one parent is strong and the other weak, it can lead to an imbalance in the child&#39;s qualities, which must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>As the child grows, if they indulge excessively or if their upbringing is improper, they may develop health issues; thus, it is essential to investigate the causes and address them appropriately. If there is a deficiency in innate vitality, nurturing later development is vital for longevity. Even if both parents are robust, excessive desires or inadequate care can lead to a variety of ailments, and even a seemingly strong child can face early death. The underlying principles here are subtle and depend on understanding both the constants and the changes in health.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br><strong>On Pediatric Medicine</strong></p>
<p>Children&#39;s blood and energy are not yet fully developed, akin to tender sprouts; any injury or damage leads to significant deterioration. Therefore, it is crucial to nurture them during normal times and avoid reckless purging and elimination. If there is food stagnation causing bloating and pain, it is advisable to temporarily relieve it; if there are symptoms of wind and cold causing fever, a temporary dispersal is appropriate; if there is substantial heat with phlegm and fire, a temporary clearance is warranted. This cannot be avoided. </p>
<p>Beyond this, if there are no sudden excessive symptoms, but the child is pale, undernourished, or showing signs of mild fever, diarrhea, exhaustion, etc., this is due to the insufficiency of the spleen and kidneys, leading to weak blood and energy. When pediatricians observe these signs, they often simply identify it as food accumulation and phlegm heat, tending to focus solely on purging and clearing, and excessively using cooling treatments, which gradually deplete the original vitality. If another illness occurs, the child will be unable to withstand it. This is a significant concern in pediatric practice that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p>
<h3>The Errors of Medicinal Treatment</h3>
<p>Children, with their unformed vitality, rely on their early years for the foundation of their future health. Thus, dietary habits should be carefully adjusted, and the use of medicines must be particularly cautious. Nowadays, pediatric practitioners, lacking knowledge of this fundamental principle and having no clear understanding, only seek immediate results. Consequently, when a child becomes ill, regardless of whether the condition is due to deficiency or excess, cold or heat, they resort to recipes that primarily aim to dispel wind, eliminate food stagnation, clear phlegm, and lower fire, all consisting of over twenty ingredients. This approach is mixed together and misrepresented as reliable, which is absurd. If a child has a certain ailment and is treated with these medicines, their illness will be exacerbated; if there is no ailment, then their vital energy will be harmed. Given that children&#39;s vital energy is limited, how can they avoid damage that leads to unpredictable changes? This misunderstanding represents a grave issue in contemporary pediatrics, highlighting the danger of careless treatment. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are those who care for their children and, noticing them looking pale, thin, or weak, grow concerned. They consult common practitioners, who, instead of diagnosing phlegm or fire, hastily attribute it to food accumulation and recommend the constant use of products like Fat Child Pills or Baohe Pills. Little do they realize that Fat Child Pills, composed of bitter and cold ingredients, severely damage the original yang; while Baohe Pills, designed for expulsion, drastically deplete stomach energy. They think they are nurturing the child when in fact, it only serves to make a thin child even thinner; they believe they are ensuring harmony, when in truth, it creates disharmony.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>Just like the Baolong pill and similar medicines, they should not be used lightly or repeatedly. I once saw the son of a wealthy man, who often had phlegm and would occasionally shout out, and whenever he fell ill, he would take this pill and instantly recover. At that time, it was thought to be a miraculous remedy, and this happened more than ten times. As he grew older, he became completely ignorant, a mere simpleton; could this not be due to the damage to his vital essence? Such powerful medicines must be used with great caution. Therefore, they should only be used for genuine conditions: real heat and deficiency of the body warrant the use of Feier pill and cold remedies; genuine food stagnation requires the Baohuo pill and digestive aids; true phlegmatic heat with shortness of breath calls for the Baolong pill and phlegm dissolvers. Even when using these, one should merely address the immediate illness; they cannot be used excessively. If there is no actual pathogen to grapple with, and one observes various symptoms, they often stem from a loss of vital energy. In such cases, one should focus on nurturing and replenishing, as this is the true way to preserve vitality. If one is unaware of this and simply uses remedies like Feier and Baohuo for protection, oblivious to the fact that a child has limited vital energy and is already weakened by illness, then the physician’s actions would only further damage it, resulting in very few not withering away. Moreover, substances such as Rhubarb, Glauber’s salt, black charcoal, Yan flower, Euphorbia, Sanguisorba, and Mugwort should not be used lightly unless absolutely necessary.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br><strong>Secret Record of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Children&#39;s Medicine Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>In children&#39;s medicine, once the essentials are grasped, there are no difficult cases. Now, I will transmit a method for all future children to attain longevity. The method involves first observing the complexion, then checking the pulse. When a child is ill, the complexion must be vivid. One can discern it by examining the point above the nose and between the eyes, at the center. </p>
<p>If the complexion is red, it indicates heart heat; if red veins are visibly straight across the bridge of the nose, it further confirms heart heat. A purple complexion suggests severe heart heat, with lung heat also present. A green complexion indicates liver wind; if green veins appear straight, it signifies liver heat; if they are horizontal, it also indicates liver heat; the straight ones suggest rising wind, while the horizontal ones suggest descending wind. </p>
<p>If the complexion is black, it indicates severe wind with cold in the kidneys. A white complexion indicates phlegm in the lungs. A yellow complexion suggests deficiencies in the spleen and stomach leading to diarrhea; yellow veins visible across the bridge of the nose, regardless of being horizontal or straight, are all signs of spleen and stomach issues. These are the only few colors relevant, thus one can determine the child&#39;s illness at a glance. </p>
<p>For adults, pulses are checked at the cun, guan, and chi positions; the same applies to children but they don’t require checking all three. It suffices to observe whether there is a pulse or not. A vibrant pulse indicates heat, while an absent pulse indicates cold. Among those that are present, a floating pulse suggests wind, a sinking pulse suggests cold, a slow pulse suggests dampness, a taut pulse suggests evil qi, and a slippery pulse suggests phlegm; this is all. There is no need to examine the seven superficial and eight deep pulses. If one understands my method, then there is no need to read pulse classics. If the pulse has a stop, it indicates pain. I need not elaborate further.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>In children, the main maladies are typically vomiting, diarrhea, cold extremities, and heat-related illnesses; there are no other significant diseases. Sometimes there may be heart pain, abdominal pain, or lumps, or there may be sores, which can be easily observed. However, in children&#39;s illnesses, those of deficiency are nine out of ten, while those of excess are one out of ten; thus, it is advisable to prioritize tonifying herbs. I shall now present three formulas for treating various conditions in children. </p>
<p>First formula: Three fen of ginseng, five fen of white atractylodes, one qian of poria, one fen of licorice, two fen of dried tangerine peel, three fen of mass (fermented grain), and one fen of pinellia. This is a modification of the Six Gentlemen Decoction, effective in treating children&#39;s weak spleen and stomach ailments. If the child has an excess due to meat consumption, add five pieces of hawthorn. If due to rice consumption, add five fen of malt. If due to wheat consumption, add three fen of radish seeds.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>For those who vomit, add one piece of white cardamom, remove licorice, and add three slices of fresh ginger. For those who have diarrhea, add three grams of dried ginger and five grams of polyporus. </p>
<p>The second formula: it treats exterior pathogens. Whether it’s a cold or flu, cough, fever or no fever, headaches, nasal congestion, excessive phlegm, palpitations, or muscle spasms, this formula effectively addresses all of these conditions. </p>
<p>The formula consists of seven grams of bupleurum, three grams of licorice, five grams of balloon flower, three grams of pinellia, three grams of scutellaria, two qian (a measurement) of white peony, two qian of white atractylodes, five grams of angelica, two qian of dried tangerine peel, five grams of poria, and decoct in water for consumption. </p>
<p>For headaches, add three grams of vitex; for chest pain where pressure cannot be applied, indicating real fire, add ten grams of gardenia. If pressure does not cause pain, indicating deficiency fire, add eight grams of licorice, five grams of guanzhong, three grams of aromatic wood, and one gram of frankincense.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>For those with side pain, add three qian of white peony root. For abdominal pain, press with your hand; if pressing increases the pain, it is due to food intake, add one qian of rhubarb; if pressing does not cause pain, it is due to cold, not food, add three fen of cassia and three fen of dried ginger. If there is continuous sweating, add one leaf of mulberry. For eye pain and redness, due to heat, add three fen of coptis and one fen of white breakstone. For throat pain, add three fen of mountain bean root.</p>
<p>For the third formula: to treat symptoms of deficiency and cold, night sweats, crying and sleeplessness at night, anxiety, persistent cough, slow movement, slow speech, and conditions that may develop into tuberculosis. The formula includes three qian of cooked rehmannia, two qian of cornelian cherry, two qian of ophiopogon, five fen of northern five-flavor fruit, two qian of original root, two qian of white atractylodes, one qian of poria, three qian of coix seed, one qian of tree peony bark, two qian of sand ginseng, two qian of earth bone bark, prepared with water. If there is also an external pathogen, add five fen of bupleurum, three qian of white peony, and one qian of white mustard seed. There is nothing else to add or subtract.</p>
<p>Additionally: if there are visible blue veins above the mountain root, this indicates liver heat. Use three fen of bupleurum, one qian of white peony, five fen of danggui, three fen of pinellia, five fen of white atractylodes, one qian of poria, three hawthorn fruits, and one fen of licorice, prepared with water. If there are horizontal blue veins, this also indicates liver heat; however, vertical veins suggest wind upward movement, while horizontal veins suggest wind downward movement. Use the previous formula, increasing bupleurum by two fen, and adding one qian of malt and one fen of dried ginger.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br>If there are red veins appearing straight, it indicates a heat in the heart. Additionally, use the previous formula, adding one to two parts of huanglian (Coptis), five parts of maidong (Ophiopogon), removing banxia (Pinellia), and adding three parts of sangbaipi (Morus bark) and two parts of tianhuafen (Trichosanthes powder). </p>
<p>If there are red veins appearing obliquely, it also signifies heat in the heart. Again, use the previous formula, adding two parts of huanglian, as the heat is severe in the chest. It is also not advisable to use banxia, but instead use sangbaipi and tianhuafen. </p>
<p>If yellow veins are present at the base of the mountain, it does not matter whether they are horizontal or vertical; all are related to spleen and stomach conditions. This may include symptoms such as water diarrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or loss of appetite. The remaining formula can all be taken. When taken, none fail to show remarkable effects.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br>If the skin is yellow, indicating yellow bile, use five parts white atractylodes, five parts poria, two parts dried tangerine peel, two parts ginseng, one part shen qu, two parts malt, one part licorice, and one vial of water. Decoct half a wine cup and take in two doses, adding seven pieces of thin bamboo leaf. If there is phlegm, add one part pinellia, or two parts white mustard seed, or two parts tianhua fen; if there is heat, such as thirst, additionally add three parts ophiopogon and one part scutellaria; if there is cold, add one part dried ginger; if vomiting, add one grain of white cardamom; if diarrhea, add five parts polyporus. For abdominal pain where a child holds their stomach, press it; if they cry out in pain, it is food accumulation, add three parts rhubarb and one part bitter orange; if pressing does not cause pain or crying, it is cold, add three parts dried ginger. If there is body heat, this formula should not be used. I have created another prescription called Wanquan Decoction, effective for any child with fever, regardless of whether it is at night, in the morning, or in the evening. Its effect is invariably miraculous.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　水鉴先生曰：小儿虽受阴阳二气成其形，气尚未周，何言有脉。直至变蒸候尽，阴阳气足。方可看脉。其髫龀之年，方生阴阳。古云男子七岁曰髫，生其原阳之气；女子八岁日龀，其阴阳方成。故未满髫龀之年，呼为纯阳。若髫龀满后，呼为童儿，始可看脉。小儿初生至半岁之间，有病速看额前、眉上、发际下，以无名指、中指、食指轻手满按之。若三指俱热，感寒鼻塞气粗；三指俱冷，上吐下泻。若食指热，胸堂不宽；无名指热，乳食不和，以致病也。半岁已上，方可看虎口。周岁已上，看虎口兼一指脉。若五百六十四日变蒸满足，只看一指脉，以食指按之，上下滚转，分取三部。凡言三部，非寸关尺也。小儿三部，面看其色为一部，虎口脉纹为二部，一指脉为三部。五脉者，上按额前，下按太冲，并前三部，共为五脉。小儿有疾病，无恶候，不必常诊太冲之脉，此脉定生死之要会。<a id="orig-26p" href="#trans-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>如七八岁脉一息六至为常人之脉，一息八至为热，九至风，五至虚，四至损，三至脱，二至死；十至必是病劳虚损，形容瘦劣。若或体肥而色青白，一息十一二至，谓之虚，是风病死，是为脉乱。若一息一二至，为脉不来，其人当厥冷而死迟。若一息十一二至者，为脉速，死不满三月。何谓一息？一呼一吸为一息。呼吸者，即是出一气入一气，谓之一息。其脉若指下来硬隐指急大者，是有积；若小微细，即是冷；若轻虚紧，即是热；时复一大，即是人惊；若大小不匀，即是恶候也。所论浮数为热，伏结为寒，沉细为冷，大小不匀为恶候。数者紧也；浮者轻也；伏者贴也，重手方见；结者乱也；沉者重没；沉细者微也。大小不匀，即是或大或小而不匀，是谓气不生，其人必死也。且如前人备述三部五脉之法，书之于左。后学将此不可视以细事，人命所系，务要诚心诊察，兢兢业业，庶几则可。设有所悞，祸之不轻。医为人之司命，可不谨乎！<a id="orig-27p" href="#trans-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>　　　　　辨三部脉证</p>

<p>　　　　　小儿总论</p>
<p>　　小儿之病，古人谓之哑科，以其言语不能通，病情不易测，故曰宁治十男子，其治一妇人，宁治十妇人，莫治一小儿，此甚言小儿之难也。然以余较之，则三者之中，又惟小儿为最易。何以见之？盖小儿之病，非外感风寒，则内伤饮食，以至惊风吐泻，及寒热疳癎之类，不过数种；且其脏气清灵，随拨随应，但能确得其本而撮取之，则一药可愈，非若男妇损伤，积痼痴顽者之比，余故谓其易也。第人谓其难，谓其难辨也；余谓其易，谓其易治也。设或辨之不真，则诚然难矣。然辨之之法，亦不过辨其表里寒热虚实，六者洞然，又何难治之有。故凡外感者，必有表证而无里证，如发热头痛，拘急无汗，或因风搐搦之类是也。内伤者，止有里证而无表证，如吐泻腹痛胀满，惊疳积聚之类是也。热者必有热证，如热海躁烦，秘结痈疡之类是也。寒者必有寒证，如清冷吐泻，无热无烦，恶心喜热者是也。<a id="orig-166p" href="#trans-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>凡此四者，即表里寒热之证，极易辨也。然于四者之中，尤惟虚实二字，最为紧要。盖有形色之虚实，有声音之虎实，有脉息之虚实。如体质强盛与柔弱者有异也，形色红赤与青白者有异也，声音雄壮与短怯者有异也，脉息滑实与虚细者有异也。故必内察其脉候，外观其形气，中审其病情，参此数者而精察之，又何虚实之难办哉。必其果有实邪，果有火证，则不得不为治标。<a id="orig-167p" href="#trans-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>然治标之法，宜精简轻锐，适当其可，及病则已，毫勿犯其正气，斯为高手。但见虚象，便不可妄行攻击，任意消耗。若见之不真，不可谓姑去其邪，谅亦无害。不知小儿以柔嫩之体，气血未坚，脏腑甚脆，略受伤残，萎谢极易，一剂之谬尚不能堪。而况其甚乎。矧以方生之气，不思培植，而但知剥削，近则为目下之害，远则遗终身之羸，良可叹也。凡此者实求本之道，诚幼科最要之肯綮。虽言之若无奇异，而何知者之茫然也，故余于篇端首以为言。然非有察察之见者，固不足以语此，此其所以不易也。<a id="orig-168p" href="#trans-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>　　　　　看寿夭法</p>

<p>　　凡小儿形体既具，经脉已全，所以初脱胞胎，便有脉息可辨。故通评虚实论曰：乳子病热脉悬小者，手足温则生，寒则死。乳子病风热喘鸣肩息者，脉实大也，缓则生，急则死。此轩岐之诊小儿，未尝不重在脉，亦未尝不兼证为言也。自《水镜诀》及《全幼心鉴》等书，乃有三岁以上，当察虎口寅卯辰风气命三关之说。其中之可取者，惟曰脉从寅关起不至卯关者易治，若连卯关者难治，若寅侵卯卯侵过辰者，十不救一。只此数语，乃于危急之际，方可用辨吉凶。至若紫为风，红为伤寒，青为惊，白为疳，及青是四足惊，赤是水惊，黑是人惊，黄是雷惊之类，岂此一线之色，果能辨悉如此？最属无稽，乌足凭也。<a id="orig-170p" href="#trans-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>即今幼科所尚，无不以此为科套，全不知脉，而信口胡猜。试问其心果亦有的确之见否？茫然无据，而欲以人子为尝试，良可叹也。故凡诊小儿，既其言语不通，尤当以脉为主，而参以形色声音，则万无一失矣。然小儿之脉，非比大人之多端，但察其强弱缓急四者之脉，是即小儿之肯綮。盖强弱可以见虚实，缓急可以见邪正。四者既明，则无论诸证，但随其病以合其脉而参此四者之因，则左右逢源，所遇皆道矣。再加以声色之辨，更自的确无疑，又何遁倩之有。此最活最妙之心法也。若单以一脉凿言一病，则一病亦能兼诸脉，其中真假疑似，未免胶柱，实有难于确据者。然法不可废，最所当察，惟择其得理者可耳。<a id="orig-171p" href="#trans-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>　　　　　声音</p>
<p>　　声由气发，气实则声壮，气虚则声怯。故欲察气之虚实者，莫先乎声音。如《内经》诸篇：有口言而微，终日乃复言者，此夺气也；有曰气海有余者，气满胸中悗息面赤，气海不足，则气少不足以言；有曰心气虚则悲，实则笑不休；有曰手少阴虚则不能言；有曰内夺而厥则为喑，此肾虚也。华元化曰：阳候多语，阴证无声；多语者易治，无声者难荣。凡此皆声音虚实之辨，故彼圣人者闻声知情，无所不达。此声音之学，所以不可忽也。<a id="orig-172p" href="#trans-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>　　　　　颜色</p>
<p>　　脉要精微论曰：夫精明五色者，气之华也。赤欲如白裹朱，不欲如赭，白欲如鹅羽，不欲如盐；青欲如苍璧之泽，不欲如蓝；黄欲如罗裹雄黄，不欲如黄土；黑欲知重漆色，不欲如地苍。五色精微象见矣，其寿不久也。　　玉版论要篇曰：色夭面脱不治，百日尽已。色见上下左右，各在其要。上为逆，下为从。女子右为逆，左为从；男子左为逆，右为从。　　五色篇曰：官五色奈何？曰：青黑为痛，黄赤为热，白为寒，是谓五官。又曰：以色言病之间甚奈何？曰：其色粗以明，沉夭者，为甚；某色上行者，病益甚；其色下行如云彻散者，病方已。　　经脉篇曰：凡诊络脉，脉色青则寒且痛，赤则有热。胃中寒，手鱼际之络多青矣。胃中有热，鱼际络赤。其暴黑者，留久痹也。<a id="orig-173p" href="#trans-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>其有赤有黑有青者，寒热气也。其青短者，少气也。　　凡察色之法，大都青白者少热气，病主阴邪；黄赤者多热气，病主阳盛。　　青主风气，主肝邪，主脾肾虚寒，主心腹疼痛，主暴惊伤心胆之气，主惊风，当察兼色以分急慢。　　白主气虚，甚则气脱，主无火，主脾肺不足。白兼青者，主慢惊，主大小肠泄泻。　　赤主火，主痰热，主伤寒热证，主烦渴，主急惊躁扰，主闭结，主阳邪喘促，主痈疡痘疹。　　黑属水，主阴寒，主厥逆，主痛极。沉黑，主危笃。　　黄主积聚，主痞块，主脾病，主胀满，主脾疳。黄兼白者，主脾寒脾弱，主气虚神怯。黄兼青者，主脾虚泄泻，主慢脾风。黄兼赤者主疳热。　　两颧鲜红或作或止者，谓之面戴阳，乃真阴弱，此非阳证也，不得以热赤同论。<a id="orig-174p" href="#trans-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>　　　　　诊治大法</p>
<p>　　凡小儿之病，本不易察，但其为病之源，多有所因。故凡临证者，必须察父母先天之气，而母气为尤切。如母多火者，子必有火病；母多寒者，子必有寒病；母之脾肾不足者，子亦如之。凡骨软、行迟、齿迟、语迟、顖门开大、疳热、脾泄之类，多有由于母气者。虽父母之气俱有所禀，但母气之应在近，父气之应在远，或以一强一弱而偏得一人之气者，是皆不可不察。至若稍长而纵口纵欲，或调摄失宜而自为病者，此文当察其所由，辨而治之。如果先天不足，而培以后天，方可致寿。虽曰先天俱盛，而或父母多欲，或抚养失宜，则病变百端，虽强亦夭。此中几圆理微，贵在知常知变也。<a id="orig-175p" href="#trans-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>　　　　　论时医</p>
<p>　　小儿血气未充，亦如苗萼之柔嫩，一或伤残，无不雕谢；故平时最宜培植，不可妄行消导。其或果有食滞胀痛，则宜暂消；果有风寒发热，则宜暂散；果有实热痰火，则宜暂清；此不得不治其标也。舍此之外，如无暴急标病，而时且青黄羸瘦，或腹膨微热溏泄困倦等证，则由脾肾不足，血气薄弱而然。而时医见此，无非曰食积痰火，而但知消导，尤尚清凉，日消日剥，则元气日损，再逢他疾，则无能支矣。此幼科时俗之大病，有不可不察者也。<a id="orig-176p" href="#trans-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>　　　　　药饵之误</p>
<p>　　小儿血气未充，而一生盛衰之基，全在幼时，此饮食之宜调，而药饵尤当慎也。今举世幼科，既不知此大本，又无的确明见，而惟苟完目前，故凡遇一病，则无论虚实寒热，但用海底兜法，而悉以散风消食、清痰降火、行滞利水之剂，总不出二十余味，一套混用，谬称稳当，何其诞也。夫有是病而用是药则病受之矣，无是病而用是药则元气受之矣。小儿元气几何，能无阴受其损而变生不测耶？此当今幼科之大病，而医之不可任者，正以此也。又见有爱子者，因其青黄瘦弱，每以为虑。而询之庸流，则不云痰火，必云食积，动以肥儿丸、保和丸之类，使之常服。不知肥儿丸以苦寒之品，最败元阳；保和丸以消耗之物，极损胃气。谓其肥儿也，而适足以瘦儿；谓其保和也，而适足以违和耳。<a id="orig-177p" href="#trans-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>即如抱龙丸之类，亦不宜轻易屡用。余尝见一富翁之子，每多痰气，或时惊叫，凡遇疾作，辄用此丸一投即愈。彼时以为神丹，如此者不啻十余次。及其长也，则一无所知，凝然一痴物而已，岂非暗损元神所致耶？凡此克伐之剂，所以最当慎用。故必有真正火证疳热，乃宜肥儿丸及寒凉等剂；真正食积胀满，乃宜保和丸及消导等剂；真正痰火喘急，乃宜抱龙丸及化痰等剂。即用此者，亦不过中病即止，非可过也。若无此实邪可据，而见诸出入之病，则多由亏损元气，悉当加意培补，方是保赤之主。倘不知此而徒以肥儿保和等名，乃欲藉为保障；不知小儿之元气无多，病已伤之，而医复伐之，其有不萎败者鲜矣。此外如大黄、芒硝、黑丑、芫花、大戟、三棱、蓬朮之类，若非必不得已，皆不可轻易投也。<a id="orig-178p" href="#trans-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘录 【清　陈士铎】</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the pulse is weak and the hands and feet are cold, it is difficult to resolve. If the pulse is weak but the hands and feet are warm, it is easy to resolve. </p>
<p>Note: &quot;Bian&quot; means to differentiate. The term &quot;red and differentiated stool&quot; refers to a separation between yellow and red. This is because the middle jiao processes the turbid residues and transforms the essence into blood, circulating in the meridians, termed as nutrient qi. Food and drink normally reside together in the stomach, forming residue that descends into the large intestine, where it mixes with transformed fluid and seeps into the bladder. If the stool is red and differentiated, it implies that the blood in the middle jiao is being expelled along with the residue. When there is diarrhea, the large intestine is deficient and cannot properly transform. In this case, the gastrointestinal system fails to nourish the pulse with its essence, hence the weak pulse. However, when the hands and feet are warm, it indicates that the lower jiao has vitality, making it easier to resolve. This indicates that the essence of food and drink in the middle jiao relies on the vitality of the lower jiao for transformation.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Longevity and Mortality</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, if their cries are long and continuous, it indicates a long life. If the cries cease and then suddenly become urgent, it suggests a short life. If the cries are scattered, it indicates that they will not reach adulthood. If the cries are deep, it also suggests they will not reach adulthood. If the umbilical cord has no blood, it is favorable. A small umbilical cord indicates a short life. If the body is soft and weak as if it has no bones, it suggests a short life. A bright and robust appearance indicates longevity. If the eyes open by themselves, it suggests they will not reach adulthood. If the eyes do not align correctly and move excessively, it is unfavorable. Sweating blood indicates many troubles and a short life. If there is no sweat, it suggests they will not reach adulthood. If urine is thick like fatty grease, it suggests they will not reach adulthood. If there are four fractures in the head, it indicates they will not reach adulthood. If the child constantly shakes their hands and feet, it indicates they will not reach adulthood. Early sitting, early walking, early teeth, and early speech are all signs of poor fate, not of a good person. If the hair on the head does not cover the scalp evenly, the child is unlikely to reach adulthood. Sparse hair indicates they will not be able to listen to others. If there is a swirl of hair on the forehead, it will bring early misfortune to the parents. If the occipital bone does not form properly, they may speak but will die. If the coccyx does not form properly, they may sit but will die. If the bones of the palm do not form properly, they may crawl but will die. If the heel bone does not form properly, they may walk but will die. If the kneecap does not form properly, they may stand but will die. If the body does not gather properly, they will die. If they have a fish-shaped mouth, they will die. If there is no living flesh between the thighs, they will die. If the jaw is broken, they will die. If the genitalia do not appear, they will die. If the scrotum is white underneath, they will die; if it is red, they will die. If the sutures of the skull are open and dark, it indicates longevity.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>General Discussion on Children</strong></p>
<p>For children above three years old and under one, observe their temperament to understand their potential for lifespan. Children who are perceptive and quick to understand often die young. Those who resemble the likes of Xiang Qiao and Yan Hui are examples. If a child&#39;s bones are well-formed and they exhibit grace and ease, requiring little effort for refinement, they tend to live long. Those who are quick-witted and agile in understanding others are also prone to early death, similar to figures like Yang Xiu and Kong Rong. From this perspective, one can glean insights about longevity. It is akin to plum blossoms blooming early, unaware of the winter&#39;s harshness; sweet chrysanthemums bloom late, ultimately achieving longevity. Therefore, delayed development suggests a sign of longevity.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pediatric Pulse Diagnosis</strong> </p>
<p><strong>By Qian Yi of the Song Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pulse Methods</strong></p>
<p>A tight and rapid pulse indicates disharmony of qi; a deep and slow pulse indicates food stagnation; a hurried and knotty pulse indicates a state of fright; a floating pulse indicates wind, while a deep and fine pulse indicates cold; a chaotic pulse cannot be treated. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pulse reflects the body&#39;s constitution and is a precursor to pathological changes; it serves as a guideline for medication, thus it is essential to understand it clearly. The &quot;Complete Guide to Pediatric Care&quot; states that for children under one year old, one should check the three pulse positions at the tiger&#39;s mouth (the index finger) to assess illness. If the pulse from the Yin (the first position) reaches only to the Mao (the second position), it is easy to treat; if it connects to the Mao, it is difficult to treat; and if the Yin encroaches on the Mao or the Mao extends beyond the Chen (the third position), the chances of recovery are slim. If the pulse shows five colors, such as blue due to fright or purple due to diarrhea, one should categorize these accordingly. After one year of age, one can use a single finger to assess its three parts: the rapid, floating, and sinking pulses. By four to five years old, a pulse rate of seven or eight and fine is normal; nine signifies harm, and ten indicates exhaustion.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The sixth and fifth positions are associated with emptiness and cold; a tight pulse indicates wind stroke, while a rapid pulse signifies external obstruction. If the pulse changes to a steaming quality, it must be disordered. If there is heat between the bones, the pulse will be deep and rapid. A floating pulse that is not harmonious indicates an insidious condition; a large and rapid floating pulse suggests wind-heat; a hidden knot indicates the accumulation of matter; a fine and subtle pulse points to consumption or abdominal pain; a floating and strong pulse suggests the presence of worms; a floating and slow pulse indicates stomach cold. This is the essential discussion of pulse diagnosis. However, for children, since their vital energy is not yet solidified, fright causes their energy to scatter, leading to a disordered pulse. Furthermore, one should also refer to the three positions and five pulses. The three positions involve examining the facial complexion, the pulse at the tiger&#39;s mouth, and the inch pulse. The five pulses include pressing on the forehead and diagnosing at Tai Chong, along with the three prior positions, collectively referred to as the five pulses. Although the treatment methods differentiate between deficiency and excess, actual conditions of excess are accompanied by strong disease energy and weak physical vitality, whereas deficiencies indicate both weak physical vitality and disease energy. The text states: &quot;If the true qi is depleted, it leads to deficiency; if the evil qi prevails, it results in excess.&quot; It also states: &quot;For deficiencies, replenish the root; for excesses, drain the branch.&quot; Master Dong Yuan states: &quot;If the physical condition is full, it should be drained; if the physical condition is empty, it should be supplemented.&quot;<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

<p>If the inner eye is red, it indicates excess heat in the heart; use Daohong San. If it is light red, it indicates a deficiency of heat in the heart; use Shengxi San. If it is blue, it indicates excess heat in the liver; use Xieqing Wan. If it is light blue, it indicates a deficiency of heat in the liver; use Dihuang Wan.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The eye is the essence of the five organs, each associated with a specific color.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Book of Living People: Discussions on Pediatric Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Hong, Song Dynasty</strong></p>
<p>Although the treatment methods for children and adults are generally the same, the dosages for children should be smaller, as their body heat is often lower. For ordinary colds with fever, runny nose, phlegm, cough, and thirst, use Xingsing San. If there is difficulty swallowing, with phlegm and a productive cough, use Shuzhangzi Decoction. If the head and body are warm, with yellowish stools and abdominal heat, use Sijun San, Lianqiao Drink, or Sanhuang Pills. If the head and body are warm, with white and foul-smelling stools, this indicates food stagnation in the stomach; use Shuangwan Pills. If the child has no other diseases but overindulges in food, leading to abdominal distention, fever, and headache, Shuangwan Pills can treat this. When a child has a warm body, painful head, restless spirit, red urine, and constipation, this is a severe heat condition; use Xinxin San or Tiaowei Chengqi Decoction. For headaches with fever and a fear of cold, this indicates a cold injury; use Shengma Decoction. If there&#39;s no sweating, use Mahuang Huangqing Decoction; if sweating occurs, use Shengma Huangqin Decoction—both are essential medicines. </p>
<p>Children should not take excessive cooling medicines, as cold stomachs can provoke worms, leading to symptoms resembling fright. Doctors often misinterpret these conditions and mistakenly administer fright medicines, like Musk, which may lead to vomiting and chronic fright due to a weakened stomach. Children must exhibit clear signs of heat before any dispersing treatments are considered, and great caution should be taken with purgative pills. Instead, use ingredients like Dahuang and Chuanxiong to make decoctions that can help expel the accumulated heat. In essence, the pills with Ba Dou just serve to treat food stagnation.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Pediatric Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>For a child&#39;s pulse, press on the three sections with the thumb. A count of six to seven beats per breath is considered balanced and harmonious; eight to nine indicates fever, while five suggests internal cold. A tense pulse suggests wind-induced convulsions, a deep and slow pulse indicates food stagnation, a rapid pulse signifies fright, and a tense and rapid pulse means discord in Qi. A deep and fine pulse is indicative of cold, while a floating pulse points to wind. An uneven pulse in size suggests adverse signs and malefic spirits, while a floating and large pulse indicates wind or heat hidden causing accumulations, and a fine single pulse suggests malnutrition. If there is abdominal pain accompanied by a lot of wheezing and vomiting with a strong pulse, it suggests the presence of worms. A deep and slow pulse with an intermittent fever indicates stomach cold; warming it will bring relief. </p>
<p>The rule states: a child’s pulse is tight in cases of wind convulsions; a deep and slow pulse with food stagnation leads to frequent vomiting. A tense and rapid pulse indicates discord in Qi, while a fast pulse suggests fright preventing spirit from settling. A cold pulse is deep and fine, while a wind pulse is floating. Firm stools that are difficult or prolonged indicate issues. If abdominal pain leads to tight and tense pulses, chaotic pulses are a sign that treatment may be futile. During the time of transformation, the pulse must be chaotic; without treatment, false diagnoses may follow. A single fine pulse with signs of malnutrition indicates the presence of worms, and an uneven pulse size signifies adverse signs. A slow and deep pulse with intermittent fever indicates an internal invasion of stomach cold. Excessive diarrhea with a strong pulse is difficult to treat; careful consideration and examination are necessary.</p>
<p>Master Yunqi states: Before the age of five, it is unwise to evaluate pulse characteristics, as differentiation is not possible.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Children</strong></p>
<p>From the &quot;Suwen&quot;: When the body is hot and dislikes cold, shivering and anxiety ensue, these are signs of a heat condition, belonging to the Shaoyin&#39;s fire. If there are severe and straightened limbs with internal urgency and muscle spasms, these are wind conditions, belonging to the Jueyin&#39;s wind wood. Children are defined as those above six years of age, and those above eighteen years as youth. Those below six years are not covered by the various channels, which is why infants are difficult to treat when ill, and their conditions cannot be determined. However, children and adults cannot be treated the same way; they require different treatments. Although children are fragile and soft in their bones and flesh after being swaddled, their intestines and stomach are delicate; they can digest milk and food, which helps balance their internal organs, allowing them to remain healthy. Their skin is moist and their muscles and bones are tender, thus when dressed in soft clothing, any blockage may occur, leading to internal heat accumulation. This heat can harm the heart, causing it to suffer from evil heat, resulting in fright. If fright persists, it may turn into convulsions. Generally, illnesses in children are characterized by pure Yang, with an excess of heat and a deficiency of cold.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pediatric Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>Children suffering from food accumulation, phlegm, and heat, often have issues related to milk. Generally, liver and spleen disorders are prevalent. Children are commonly afflicted with liver issues, where the liver is often excessive and the kidneys are deficient.</p>
<p><strong>Observation of Form and Color</strong></p>
<p>The forehead is associated with heart fire, the left cheek with liver wood, the right cheek with lung metal, the nose with spleen earth, and the chin with kidney water. The color purple indicates excessive heat, red signifies exterior pathogenic heat, green suggests fright, white indicates parasites, dark greenish-black points to abdominal pain, white suggests malnutrition, yellow signifies spleen deficiency, yellowish-white with blue lips indicates malaria, yellow suggests food accumulation, dark purple indicates pestilence, and bluish-white suggests liver issues. </p>
<p>When observing children’s form and color, bluish veins indicate spleen heat generating wind. Red and hot cheeks exhibit conflict, while yellow indicates spleen deficiency. Dark gas with abdominal pain indicates pestilence, and white signifies malnutrition causing weight loss. If encountering dark rings around both eyes, it is as if experiencing a dream. </p>
<p>To recognize children&#39;s symptoms, one must assess their appearance. Yellow skin with thin muscles suggests retention of masses; blue lips and a pale face indicate pain. A dry tongue and scorched lips signal internal heat, while drowsiness with dim vision suggests depleted spleen energy. Clenching hands and pulling feet indicate fright, and malnutrition produces a distended belly. </p>
<p>Mucus at the corners of the eyes signifies liver heat, while saliva at the mouth indicates spleen cold. Sparse, upright hair indicates blood deficiency, and bubbling edema suggests dampness related to the spleen.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>For children over one year old, the pulse can be examined. Six beats per breath indicate a balanced state; seven or eight beats suggest excess heat, while one to four beats indicate a slow and weak state. Normally, a child&#39;s pulse should have six beats per breath in a balanced manner. Seven to eight beats are often associated with excessive heat, while three to four beats indicate a deficiency of cold diseases. If there are nine or ten quick beats, it resembles the pecking of a sparrow, and one or two movements of the fingers indicate an illness. A slightly cold, tight, and rapid pulse is unmistakably accurate, and the treatment should be clear between tonifying and purging.</p>
<p>When there is body heat, a floating pulse may indicate the need for sweating; if the body is cold, a fine pulse suggests rest without aggressive treatment. Asthma and cough with a tight and rapid pulse show that medication may be ineffective, while swelling and a fine pulse may indicate pain. For diarrhea that is deep and slow, recovery is uncertain, and for measles with many rapid pulses, treatment is urgent. If there are vomiting and epistaxis (nosebleed) with a fear of floating and surging pulses, and abdominal pain that is deep and subtle, careful inspection is essential.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>If the lower legs feel hot, both cheeks are red, there is persistent thirst, the face is flushed, limbs are tossed about, bowel movements are obstructed, urine is yellow, the body is strong and feverish with no signs of retreat, all of these should be treated with cooling remedies. Hot and tonifying medications should not be used. </p>
<p>Young children should not be given hot medications, with cheeks resembling ripe peaches. Their hands and feet feel hot and fiery; the pulses are floating and chaotic, urine is red and concentrated, bowel movements are stubbornly constipated. They may lift their clothing to drink water, enjoy being in the wind, have persistent thirst, and experience nosebleeds.</p>
<p>If the lower legs feel cold, the face appears pale, the breath fluctuates between hot and cold, the body often leans against others, the eyes are blue, there is persistent vomiting and diarrhea, and abdominal pain occurs, all of these should be treated with warming tonics. Cooling and purging medications should not be used.</p>
<p>Young children should not be given cooling medications; their complexion appears pale and listless. The limbs are cold as ice, and the pulses are faint and hidden. They have difficulty digesting milk, often vomit, and their stools resemble duck droppings, occurring frequently. They show signs of weakness, abdominal pain, blue eyes, and prolonged illness may lead to complications.</p>
<p>For children under one year of age with illness, it is often due to fetal toxins, and it is urgent to detoxify. For those over two years old with illness, it is mostly due to food accumulation, and treatment should aim to alleviate this and tonify the spleen. Other methods are scattered throughout various sections and will not be detailed here.</p>
<p>If there is an exterior affliction from wind-cold, a dispersing powder can be used. For internal injuries from milk and food causing discomfort, harmonizing and digestive remedies should be administered concurrently. For coughs, the group of herbs known as &quot;Shen Su&quot; can be brewed, and for vomiting and diarrhea, the rectifying formula is the most effective. For shocks causing spasms, “Guangxin” should be used, and the red and green detoxifying methods should not be mixed.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>When a child is born, if there is a rupture in the body, it will surely die. If the scrotum is white, it will surely die. If the genitals do not descend, it will die. If there is no flesh in the abdomen, it will surely die. If the cry resembles that of a crow, it will surely die. At the age of one, if the skull bones are opening, teeth and hair have not emerged, limbs are contracted, knees appear like crane joints, and the body is weak and cannot stand, this indicates insufficiency of prenatal Qi, leading to early death. If the muscles are strong, then there is much strength; if the bones are solid, then there is early movement; if the blood is abundant, the body is thin with much hair; if the flesh is sufficient, there are few diseases; if the essence is rich, the child is clever and often laughs and speaks, unafraid of cold or heat; if the Qi is sufficient, there is little hair and a plump body – these all indicate an abundance of prenatal Qi, leading to longevity.</p>

According to ancient texts, if one first contracts a wind gate illness, it is still treatable; however, once it reaches the qi gate, it is certainly difficult to cure.</p>
<p>When diagnosing hand channels and colors:</p>
<p>For males, observe the left index finger; for females, observe the right index finger. The first segment of the wind gate is easy to treat, the second segment of the qi gate indicates deeper illness, and the third segment of the life gate suggests death. If the three gates are blue, it indicates shock to the limbs. If they are black, it indicates water-related shock. If they are purple or white, it suggests someone carries shock. Red indicates fear from a dog. Such pulse conditions at the three gates are very serious and signal certain death; other ailments may still be treatable.</p>
<p>The wind gate appearing blue like a fish spine is easy to treat; this is initial shock. If it is black, it becomes difficult to treat. The qi gate appearing blue like a fish spine signifies consumption and fever; it is easy to treat with a life-preserving formula added with Chai Hu and Huang Qin. The life gate appearing blue like a fish spine indicates weakness and wind evasion affecting the spleen, which is difficult to treat using a golden tablet with Bai Zhu and Fu Ling.</p>
<p>If the wind gate appears dark blue like a suspended needle, it indicates water shock. If this occurs at the qi gate, it indicates consumption with accumulated heat in the lungs; it should be treated with a life-preserving formula added with lantern heart and bamboo leaves. If the life gate shows five colors, they are all signs of death that cannot be treated.</p>
<p>If the wind gate appears like the word for water, it indicates phlegm in the diaphragm and stagnation; the treatment should focus on descending. At the qi gate, it indicates shock entering the lungs, causing coughing and a red face; treat with a life-preserving formula.

<p>Shaking the head and rubbing the eyes, liver heat produces wind. Rubbing the eyes with tears suggests heat in the three burners. A runny nose indicates lung cold. Red cheeks and a yellow face indicate wind injuring lung heat. Cholera with vomiting suggests gastric gas injury. Irregular diarrhea indicates gas attacking the intestines. A blue face and frequent yawning signal wind transferring to the liver. Frequent night sweats show internal heat. Cold injury manifests in chills and spasms. Stomach heat causes rashes and injury from cold. Long sighs and grinding teeth signal excessive wind and energy. Lifting the head and shaking indicates a full chest and stomach. Lung congestion harms and results in coughing up blood. Excessive saliva brings wheezing; accumulated heat from wind causes injuries. Painful urination indicates heat accumulating in the bladder. Hernia due to crying signifies internal blockages in the fetus. Milk bumps and spleen lumps arise from external injuries. A sore throat suggests lung heat. Craving dirt indicates spleen lesions. Vomiting phlegm suggests ascendant roundworms. Rectal bleeding indicates injuries from heat and cold. Thirst and mouth sores show heart heat. A yellow face and edema indicate gas uprising. Issues with legs and neck stiffness arise from internal heat. Speech issues and slowed movements signal accumulation harming the fetus. Stiff neck and liver wind arise from energy harming the tongue.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Life and Death</strong></p>
<p>When a child suffers from wind-heat, with wheezing and shoulder breaths, a slow pulse indicates life, while a rapid pulse indicates death. In cases of diarrhea, if the pulse is floating and large accompanied by abdominal pain, death is certain. In cases of breastfeeding illness, a small and hanging pulse with warm hands and feet indicates life, while coldness indicates death. If a child is bedridden, sweating like pearls but not flowing, that child will die.</p>
<p>If a child is ill with a sunken chest, dry lips, eyes fixated, cold breath, a lowered head, unable to rise, with limp hands and feet, rigid body, and cold palms, such cases are untreatable. The same applies to those with a disordered pulse. If the eyes roll upwards, this is called &quot;heavenly suspension,&quot; and it should be treated with &quot;Yongquan&quot; (a specific point), extinguishing flames. For those unaware of human affairs, moxibustion is advised. If the nails are red, treatment is possible. For heaviness, use &quot;Tongguan San,&quot; blowing it into the nostrils, and treat with &quot;Duanming Dan.&quot; If the child does not awaken after something enters the nose, do not attempt treatment. </p>
<p>If the entire body is red, this indicates a lung disorder, and if there is heat in the spleen channel, there is no need for medication. For children with dark rashes on the face and hands, swollen palms without patterns, dark in the &quot;Kan&quot; area, a flat and full &quot;Ren&quot; area, and foul-smelling stools, along with an inverted head, this child will surely die. </p>
<p>In summary, when examining a child, if they suckle tightly, treatment is easier; if they suckle loosely, treatment becomes more difficult.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Song</h3>
<p>In pediatrics, there are special methods, but in urgent times, it’s hard to know which to use. Sudden wind, fever, and cough with phlegm should not be neglected when taking life-preserving pills. For acute and chronic shocks, the purple gold pill is essential before the rashes appear. For vomiting and diarrhea with abdominal pain, aiding the stomach is advised; sores in the lips and mouth need to neutralize the toxins. For tidal fever, use the Xin Xin powder; for vomiting, excessive use of needles and pills is necessary. Various types of malnutrition can all use aloe, preventing the need for difficult inquiries and painful searches.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Pediatrics</h3>
<p>In the medical path, treating conditions according to the major pulse is particularly challenging, and pediatric cases are even more difficult. This is because children’s organs are delicate, their skin and bones tender, their blood and qi are not robust, their meridians are like threads, and their pulses fine as hairs. They easily fluctuate between deficiency and excess, cold and heat. Furthermore, they cannot speak, point with their hands, or indicate where they are in pain. Thus, it is rare for someone to accurately diagnose their conditions without examining their form and color, listening to sounds, and feeling the pulse to identify the source of the illness and understand their yin and yang, inner and outer, deficiency and excess.</p>
<h3>Tiger Mouth Pulse</h3>
<p>The first section: red stripes indicate shock from birds or external people. A gentle red stripe signals fire shock; black stripes indicate water shock; green stripes represent thunder or four-foot shock; slightly curled hidden green stripes denote urgent wind conditions. The second section: purple stripes indicate shock from malnutrition, blue stripes denote liver malnutrition, white stripes indicate lung malnutrition, yellow stripes represent spleen malnutrition, and black stripes are difficult to treat. The third section: blue-black stripes at the three joints mean passage is blocked, and if they lean towards the nails, it indicates untreatable conditions.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Remarkable Effects of Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Fang Xian)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Observing the Three Sections and Five Pulses of Children</strong>  </p>
<p>Mr. Shui Jian said: Although children are shaped by the dual forces of yin and yang, their energy is not yet complete, so how can one speak of pulses? Only when the transformation and steaming are completed and the energies of yin and yang are sufficient, can one observe the pulse. At the age of childhood, the formation of yin and yang begins. It is said that a boy is called &quot;tiao&quot; at the age of seven, when his original yang energy emerges; a girl is called &quot;chen&quot; at eight, when her yin and yang are fully formed. Therefore, before reaching the ages of tiao and chen, they are referred to as pure yang. After surpassing the tiao and chen ages, they are called children, and only then can the pulse be observed. </p>
<p>For a child from birth to half a year old, if there is illness, one should quickly examine the forehead, above the brows, and at the hairline, using the ring finger, middle finger, and index finger to gently press. If all three fingers are hot, it indicates a cold condition resulting in nasal congestion and coarse breathing; if all three fingers are cold, it suggests vomiting and diarrhea. If the index finger is hot, the chest is narrow; if the ring finger is hot, there is disharmony with milk and food, leading to illness. After six months, one can begin to observe the pulse at the tiger mouth area. After one year, observe both the tiger mouth and the pulse of one finger. If after five hundred sixty-four days, the steaming is sufficient, only one finger pulse should be observed by pressing with the index finger, rolling it up and down, and dividing into three sections. The term &quot;three sections&quot; here does not refer to cun, guan, and chi. For children, the three sections are: looking at the facial color as one section, the pulse patterns at the tiger mouth as the second section, and the single finger pulse as the third section. The five pulses include pressing on the forehead above and on Tai Chong below, thus combining the three sections to make five pulses. If a child is ill and shows no severe symptoms, it is not necessary to constantly examine the pulse at Tai Chong, as this pulse is crucial for determining life and death.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In a person aged seven or eight, a pulse rate of six beats per breath is typical; eight indicates heat, nine indicates wind, five indicates deficiency, four indicates harm, three indicates collapse, two indicates death. A pulse rate of ten suggests illness and fatigue, resulting in a gaunt appearance. If the body is corpulent and pale, with a pulse rate of eleven or twelve, it is termed deficiency, indicating death from wind sickness and a disordered pulse. If the pulse rate is one or two beats per breath, it signifies an absence of pulse, and the person will likely experience cold and eventually die slowly. A pulse rate of eleven or twelve signifies a rapid pulse, with death likely occurring within three months. </p>
<p>What is one breath? One inhale and one exhale constitutes one breath. Breathing means the release of air and the intake of air, which is referred to as one breath. If the pulse feels hard and urgent, it indicates a blockage; if it is small, weak, and fine, it signifies cold; if light and weak, it indicates heat; if there is a sudden strong pulse, it suggests shock; if the pulse is uneven, it indicates a dire condition. Light and rapid pulses signify heat, while deep and firm pulses indicate cold; an uneven pulse suggests a bad prognosis. </p>
<p>Rapid pulses indicate tension; light pulses suggest a floating sensation; deep pulses feel firm under pressure; a blocked pulse indicates irregularity; heavy pulses sink deeply; and fine pulses are subtle. An uneven pulse, with variations in strength, signifies a lack of vital energy, and that person is bound to die. The previous scholars have thoroughly detailed the methods of the three divisions and five pulses, noted on the left. Future practitioners must not regard this lightly, as human life is at stake; they should diligently examine with sincere intent, with care and precision.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Differentiating the Three Pulses and Symptoms</h3>
<p>When the upper pulse is black, it indicates kidney issues. When the middle pulse is black as well, it suggests lingering symptoms. People are alarmed by this mixed condition, with the eyes often staring, suggesting phlegm accumulation. </p>
<p>When the lower pulse is black, it signals further alarm, but it’s essential to disperse wind and relieve accumulated heat in the intestines. Upper and lower pulses share the same cause of disturbance, as heat causes blockage and a lack of spirit.</p>
<p>When the upper pulse is green, it indicates wind in the liver, with straight gazes causing the face to appear greener. The middle pulse corresponds to alarm affecting all four limbs, leading to thirst, restlessness, and confusion. A lower green pulse signifies recurrent alarm roots; relieving heat and manifesting the intestines involves analysis.</p>
<p>If both upper and lower pulses are green, it is severe, with only one in ten remaining stable. A red upper pulse suggests excessive wind in the lungs, possibly leading to frequent fever and cough. The middle pulse indicates wind attacking the heart, resulting in abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea.</p>
<p>A lower red pulse reflecting severe shock denotes a need to regulate the heart using divine methods. When the upper and lower pulses are both difficult to treat, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, it indicates danger. </p>
<p>When the green liver pulse retains its form, closed eyes and body aches signify fragility. In the middle pulse, it points to watery diarrhea and recurring disturbance, with heat causing breathlessness and coughs without respite. </p>
<p>A lower green pulse might indicate alarm; efficient medicine can disperse wind and mitigate calamity. If both upper and lower pulses are green and generate heat, the limbs feel cold, signaling urgency.</p>
<p>When the upper pulse appears black, the eyes are wide, with loose stools possibly showing a green hue. When observed in the middle, signs reflect thirst; lower heat seems to yield yellow urine with stable bowels. </p>
<p>If the lower black pulse reveals accompanying red, frequent diarrhea ensues. Both upper and lower pulses must be evaluated through the extremities; if they feel empty and restless, thirst calls for prompt medical attention. </p>

<p>Symptoms include wind drooling, monkey-like convulsions, umbilical wind, pursed lips, coughing, silent noises, wooden tongue, heavy palate, stiff neck, and high chest. </p>
<p><strong>Pulse Colors</strong></p>
<p>A pure red pulse indicates a newly acquired illness, characterized by Yang and heat, suggesting the disease is external. A red and purple pulse indicates a transition in disease, suggesting there is heat both internally and externally, or heat alone indicating Yang. A red or purple pulse with hints of blue indicates a chronic disease, characterized by alternating cold and heat, reflecting external changes. A pure blue pulse indicates a prolonged illness, associated with both cold and heat, and is internal and Yin. A blue and yellow pulse suggests a severe transformation to cold, where extreme cold could turn to heat, making treatment difficult; it indicates a vacant cold affecting the five organs, with conflicting Yin and Yang symptoms. A blue and black pulse indicates a critical condition, possibly from a long-standing illness leading to a dark complexion. A black and yellow pulse, especially when showing the yellow, indicates a 90% chance of death, indicating great misfortune.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

<p>The face is red, indicating a deficiency of heart qi. Fire is associated with the heart and leads to rising heat, hence this is understood. The cessation of heart function results in death. Symptoms include clenching teeth and manipulating the tongue, a protruding tongue, ulcers in the mouth, a swollen tongue, a constricted throat, a white coating on the tongue, a heavy tongue underneath, a swollen throat, phlegm and saliva bubbling up, resembling a fish’s mouth; these signify a critical and severe condition. </p>

There is a protrusion under the left brow, signifying concealed fright, often manifesting as sudden jumps during sleep. </p>
<p>The red veins at the temples are swollen and protruding, indicating the presence of wind-heat phlegm causing fright, due to rising heat attacking urgently, as there is persistent heat phlegm in the heart and stomach, gradually leading to symptoms of fright wind. Cooling agents should be employed to dispel phlegm and relieve heat to restore calm. If the red veins at the temples lead to the Yintang, the symptoms of fright have been present for many days. </p>
<p>The red color at the left brow indicates unresolved steaming heat, with heat present in the liver and lungs; it should be treated with agents that clear the lungs and disperse wind-heat while regulating the stomach qi. </p>
<p>At the Fengchi point, the redness signifies wind-heat in the upper and middle jiao, indicating a potential for convulsions; it is recommended to eliminate wind and transform phlegm. </p>
<p>At the Quchi point, redness indicates that the lingering wind has transformed and is affecting the organs; there is heat present in the three jiao and frequent relieving is advised. Redness at the Yintang implies heat, fright, phlegm, and dietary issues; if nothing is expelled, it could lead to convulsions. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The red pulse at the Yimen indicates an external kidney condition caused by wind and warmth, leading to heat and irritability. The red on the face suggests internal agitation and heat.</p>
<p>The red pulses on the right Taiyang and corners of the mouth are due to the infant&#39;s nursing mother suffering from a cold, causing obstructed milk and resulting in issues like milk tumors with wind-heat phlegm. The red pulse on the right Taiyin arises from the mother having a heat illness along with phlegm in the milk, potentially inducing phlegm. The red pulse at Wutai gradually develops into symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea due to fright.</p>
<p>The red pulse at Fengchi indicates that the mother does not avoid spicy foods or pork and mutton bone soup, possibly leading to toxic milk causing wind. The red pulse at Qichi shows that if the mother has heat and phlegm, even when the child reaches ten years, signs of the illness may still manifest. The heat-phlegm from the mother enters the child&#39;s five viscera, resulting in blurred vision and transmitting other diseases. The red pulse at Yimen indicates a kidney qi issue, related to the mother consuming beverages or odd foods, and eating chicken, geese, ducks, fish, garlic, which may lead to different illnesses later on.</p>
<p><strong>Seven Manifestations</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is floating, slippery, full, tight, and surging.<br>The floating pulse indicates wind and loss of blood, the slippery pulse suggests discernible vomiting and clear downward movement. The tight pulse indicates tension while the surging pulse typically signifies heat.</p>
<p><strong>Eight Li</strong></p>
<p>The pulse is slightly sunken, slow, soft, retracted, moist, and weak.<br>A slow and cold pulse with slight hardness indicates distress, while the hard pulse suggests stagnation of bad blood and moisture. The retracted pulse indicates pain from stagnation and cold, while the weak pulse suggests a subsequent deficiency character.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nine Patterns</strong></p>
<p>Long and short pulses, vacuity and fullness, rapid and slow, all indicate different conditions. A long pulse suggests yang deficiency in the triple warmer; a short pulse indicates that food is not digesting properly in the chest. A vacuous pulse often brings about surprise and confusion, while a rapid pulse signifies a critical situation from which it is hard to escape. A knotty pulse indicates qi stagnation leading to emaciation, while a firm pulse suggests vigorous heat as if the bones are being scorched. If the pulse is moving, it suggests a risk of blood loss and fragility; a fine pulse indicates sourness in the limbs and a tendency toward weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Observation of Infants</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, observe the two eyes for vitality; secondly, check the clarity and loudness of the voice; thirdly, examine the top of the head; fourthly, assess the appearance; and fifthly, look at the hair. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The two eyes gather the essence of the five organs and house the spirit of the whole body. If the pupils are dark and full of luster, and the spirit is bright and lively, it suggests the child will live long and have few illnesses, recovering easily even if they become sick. If the whites of the eyes are excessive and the pupils are dull or yellow, this indicates a weakness in their constitution, leading to many ailments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A loud and clear voice shows robust qi from the five organs, aiding the child in growing strong. If the child is born without crying, or if the voice does not emerge, this suggests a blockage in the yin passages of one or two organs, indicating timidity and frailty; or if the sound is feeble or like a weak whisper, this signifies that the child will not live long and will be difficult to raise.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The crown of the head relates to the mother’s qi and blood; a firm and strong crown indicates good nourishment for the child. If the mother suffers from illness or her qi and blood are weak, the child&#39;s crown will be soft and insubstantial. The back of the head relates to the father’s essence; if rich and substantial, it allows the child’s back of the head to be strong and well-nourished.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a father&#39;s vital energy is insufficient and he excessively indulges in wine, the child may have a weak and unsteady head and will also have a short life. If both parents are timid, their offspring will also not live long. In such cases, the parents will not reach a long life. The front and rear points are referred to as the &quot;trust gates,&quot; with the Daoists calling it the &quot;mud pill.&quot; The rear trust is known as the &quot;brain top gate.&quot; The center of the head is also called the &quot;hundred meetings point.&quot; Hua Tuo described facial readings in great detail. The front and rear trust, as well as the hundred meetings, if open and vacuous, are referred to as &quot;uncovered skull.&quot;</p>
<p>Fourth, in terms of appearance, a wide mouth and pointed nose, with raised eyebrows and bright eyes, indicate a child who grows easily and possesses strong blessings. Conversely, a small mouth and bent nose, with a concave and wrinkled brow, may lead to strange traits in the child, resulting in either poverty or early death — this is difficult to decipher.</p>
<p>Fifth, hair is the residue of blood. If the mother&#39;s blood and energy are abundant, the hair will be black and lustrous. If the mother&#39;s blood is deficient, leaking, or failing, with irregular menstruation, or if she indulges in excessive drinking and debauchery, or if there are disturbances from the womb, the child&#39;s hair will be yellow and withered, leading to ailments like sores or fevers.</p>
<p>In observing a child’s spirit, color, and pulse, all fall within these five aspects. It’s impossible to see them all, but if the child’s eyes are spirited and their voice is clear, this may ensure their well-being. This is the secret technique passed down by the Wang family of Han Dong.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>A Brief Treatise on Pediatric Medicine</strong></p>
<p>In pediatric medicine, the discipline is called &quot;silent discipline.&quot; The child cannot speak, and the pulse cannot be measured; one must rely solely on their appearance and color, exhausting all thoughts to apply treatment. Therefore, those who are skilled in nurturing children treat them as if raising a dragon for careful care; those who are unskilled treat them as tender calves and cherish them. The more one loves them, the more harm one inadvertently causes. At times, their head may feel warm but their feet are cold; suddenly, they cry a lot but refuse milk. A small error can lead to a huge loss. This specialized pediatric medicine serves to address what conventional practices fail to cover.</p>
<p>The intestines and stomach are fragile and easily harmed by food; the muscles and bones are weak and easily attacked by wind and cold. Parents should be aware and carefully observe the child&#39;s condition. Thick and heavy clothing may hinder warmth and drain vital energy; excessively forcing milk or food merely disrupts the spleen and harms the stomach. Hearing unusual sounds or seeing unfamiliar objects can lead to neglect in prevention; it is necessary to provide a secure environment and limit excessive outings, avoiding over-attentiveness.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

But one day, illness arises, and the hearts of parents are troubled. Distrusting doctors, they instead believe in shamans, seeking ghosts rather than medicine. Thus, the neglect of human affairs is blamed on fate.</p>
<p>To observe one&#39;s complexion, one must first discern the parts of the body. The left cheek belongs to the Green Dragon and is associated with the liver; the right cheek belongs to the White Tiger and is related to the lungs. The forehead, high and separated, embodies the heart’s fire, while the lower regions correspond to the kidney&#39;s water. The nose is at the center of the face, connecting to the spleen. By observing the colors that manifest, one can understand the origins of diseases. Moreover, the spleen corresponds to the lips, the lungs to the nose, the tongue reflects the heart, and the eyes signify the liver&#39;s fluids. The stomach flows to the lower jaw, while the kidneys open through the ears. The nails are remnants of the tendons, with the spleen governing them, while hair reflects the surplus blood, under the kidney&#39;s dominion. The spleen governs the limbs, and the kidneys connect to the teeth. If any of the internal organs decline, then the corresponding parts will surely weaken first.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Able to discern shape and color, resembling a beam striking a bell; if I am unaware of my omens, it’s like a stone thrown into water. All that is observed externally can reveal the internal. The red color signifies market heat, the blue color exposes and startles the heart. Like the blackness of coal, it indicates malice; like the yellow of oranges, it represents spleen deficiency. White signifies illness and exhaustion, purple indicates acute heat. Blue hides the mouth corners, making it difficult for the physician Bian Que to treat; black obscures the sun, making it impossible for physician Lu to cure.

Nighttime crying falls into four categories, changing with the seasons throughout the year. My heart is hot and longs to speak but cannot; my spleen is weak, making me lethargic at all times. Those who lose their voice after illness have weak kidneys; coughing without a voice indicates lung atrophy. If there is abdominal pain with a clear watery discharge, it suggests worms; if there is belly pain with foul-smelling stools, it points to accumulation.

Counteracting jaundice and reducing swelling can be managed with adjusted stomach formulas; breaking accumulations and calming parasites requires the collected wisdom of the saints. Generally, infants are prone to both deficiency and excess. The key is to maintain balance in treatment, ensuring that replenishment and drainage do not exceed their doses. One should especially avoid Ba Niu and refrain from excessive use of mineral substances. Spicy heat disperses by consuming yin, while bitter cold destroys yang and damages the stomach.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Caring for the Young and Guarding the Heart</strong></p>
<p>In the realm of medicine, the treatment of infants is the most challenging. Their digestive system is delicate and easily harmed by milk and food, their bones are tender and susceptible to wind and cold. They are quick to become weak or robust as if by turning the hand, and the response to treatment can vary; sometimes, one must nourish or drain with the utmost care. Salty flavors often act on the kidneys, while sour tastes support the liver. Bitter flavors harm the stomach and chill it, while pungent flavors move to the lungs and create dryness that damages the essence. One seeks balance and moderation, avoiding extremes in taste.</p>
<p>In cases of illness, beware of dizziness and avoid toxic remedies; treatment should be appropriate to the situation and based on what is effective. When recognizing a central ailment, prioritize the root cause. If one rashly resorts to herbal decoctions, it may lead to grievous consequences. This reflects the skilled practitioner’s commitment to preserving life, while a good doctor’s judgment is proven through the cure of broken bones.</p>
<p>I have heard that there are no fixed rules in medicine, only observations of symptoms; do not administer potions without thorough understanding. Those who are ill must be careful in choosing their treatments, and doctors should focus on ensuring recovery. Treat illness as if it were your own, and do not be greedy for personal gain.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>First, observe the circulation of Qi and the subtle harmony of Yin and Yang; then, examine the appearance and demeanor, grasping the trends of fortune and misfortune. In spring and summer, Yang prevails and the bitterness of cold can be utilized, as evidenced by a person&#39;s vitality; in autumn and winter, Yin prevails and warmth can alleviate the suffering, reflecting the labor and illness of individuals. If one warms and restores, then one can counteract the cold and expel. When the Seven Spirits disperse and the Five Organs weaken and collapse, even if one diligently checks the pulse, what remedy exists for the world? It may lead to premature demise and incur divine wrath. Thus, in case of fetal distress, one must urgently detoxify; for food stagnation, the benefit lies in digesting it. Treatment is divided into two methods, and efficacy can be complete. When the swaddling is unsettled, simply adjust the mother; if the infant does not crawl well, then strengthen its vitality. Alas, the balance of the stomach and intestines cannot tolerate medicinals or stones; there is a subtlety in the Qi and blood that is weak and requires gradual nurturing. Treatment is not undertaken lightly; illness can strike suddenly. Like guarding a flickering candle, the heart must remain vigilant; like treasuring a precious pearl, one must focus earnestly. Medicine can augment fate; one should not bring shame to family traditions. Moreover, when illness arises, heat emerges; when heat arises, anxiety follows.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

When heat is superficial, herbs like mulberry and ramie can relieve the muscles and can be ingested; when heat is internal, herbs like gentian and scutellaria can eliminate toxins and must be decocted urgently. For accumulated heat, nothing compares to gathering the sages&#39; wisdom; for empty heat, it’s best to adjust the vital essence. It is crucial to understand the pulse and complexion, and not to recklessly administer prescriptions. Missteps can lead to lifelong ailments or shorten an infant&#39;s lifespan. Treating lightly can aggravate a condition, and actions alone cannot resolve problems. Simply entrusting oneself to fate without careful examination leads to misfortune. Past mistakes remain as warnings for future actions. The soul wanders in the fields, its cries resonate in the depths of springs. Given these reasons, whose fault is it? Alas! Even ants can cross bridges, and sparrows can escape nets. How much more so for the essence of all things, which is not to be valued less than a lowly insect.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Regulate the transformation of essence and preserve true vitality. It is better to be adept in temple rituals than in assault; it is better to act slowly than to rush. Planting apricots forms a grove, following in the footsteps of Dong Feng; planting oranges by the famous well reflects the legacy of Su Dan today. Alas, chronic leakage leads to dysentery, long-term accumulation results in ulcers, persistent fever causes distension, and excessive fright leads to convulsions. If one has not lingered yet, treatment should be swift; if diseases are already evident, treatment should be gradual. For secretive blockages in the intestines and stomach, prompt expulsion is essential; for deficiencies in qi and blood, swift nourishment is required for stabilization. External toxins must be urgently attacked, lest they enter the abdomen; the urgent dispelling of surface pathogens should not be allowed to transmit again. Thus, I would proceed slowly and with care, fearing that haste may lead to complications. Just as one swallows medicine, one must guard against excess; when treating somewhat serious conditions, do not overstretch one’s capabilities. The wise always consider potential missteps; those who have died cannot be restored to wholeness. Rather than regret what has already occurred, it is better to be cautious about what has yet to happen. If one seeks fish and rabbits, one must protect the reed and hoof. If many methods are employed to treat diseases, three reflections upon these words are advisable!</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Children</strong></p>
<p>For a red face and fever, administer cool medicine; for yellow and white fever, use Stomach Ling. For body heat and constipation, administer the Three Huang; for weak and feverish children, gather the Holy Spirit. For transformation and evaporative heat, use the pressure method; for convulsions, direct the red to swallow the green. For diarrhea, use one pill of Stomach Ling; for heat-related diarrhea, the Jade Dew Powder should be taken together. For cold diarrhea, the Regulating Center Pill can be consumed; for thirst, the White Atractylodes Powder generates fluids. Dysentery can be treated with the Harmonizing and Scenting Powder; malaria can be alleviated by nourishing the spleen, allowing the malaria to naturally resolve. For coughs, the Jade Liquid dispels phlegm and qi; swelling can be treated with Stomach Ling to guide it to the heart. For sores and scabies, Black Sesame Pills are the best, and nourishing the spleen is most crucial for protecting infants.

<p><strong>Pulse Method</strong></p>
<p>For children, a single finger divides into three positions, with six beats indicating the pulse; seven to eight beats signify heat, while three to four beats suggest a slow, weak, or cold condition.

<p><strong>Miscellaneous Conditions</strong></p>
<p>When children eat dirt, heat in the spleen is countered with yellow purging methods. Intermittent administration of divine remedies is crucial, as it helps counteract the effects of malnutrition. If a child sleeps with a pale face, it indicates heat in the heart; treat it with Dao Chi San to cool and expel heat. If a child has frequent pale urine resembling rice wash, administering Wei Ling Salt Soup is recommended, followed by several doses of Jie You decoction. For children with green stools, it indicates heat in the liver channel; using Xie Qing Wan is remarkably effective.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Water Mirror Formula</strong></p>
<p>The operation of yin and yang brings about the formation of men and women. Once the nine orifices and four limbs are divided, the five viscera and six bowels are born. Each part is distinct, and distinguishing between order and disorder can be difficult. If one relies solely on the fluctuations at the pulse point, it can lead to disastrous outcomes in children. </p>
<p>One must clarify the tiger&#39;s mouth, discern the three gates, and carefully analyze medicinal usage to avoid mistakes. Up to the age of three, only the tiger’s mouth should be examined, with boys on the left and girls on the right, at the second finger. The first segment is called the Wind Gate; if the pulse shows initial signs, it indicates sickness. The second segment is the Qi Gate; if the pulse is detected here, treatment is difficult. The third segment is the Life Gate; if the pulse is evident, it signifies death.</p>
<p>One should also distinguish colors; if the three gates are blue, it indicates surprise in the four limbs; if they are red, it points to watery aversion; if they are black, it signifies shock. Purple indicates diarrhea, while yellow suggests thunderous surprise. If the pulse at the three gates is unobstructed, it is a sign of imminent danger; otherwise, the illness can be treated. A pattern of either blue or red, with a line-like stripe, indicates damage from food and heat-induced surprise. If both sides are the same, it signals simultaneous surprise and accumulation.</p>
<p>If there are three or if it disperses, it shows wind phlegm from the lungs or indicates a dry cough with sound. Blue indicates cold damage and cough, while fiery red indicates diarrhea. A combination of black indicates diarrhea, while predominant blue indicates more white diarrhea, and predominant red points to more red diarrhea, accompanied by a purple shade that adds thirst but is not false. Disordered pulse patterns at the tiger&#39;s mouth signify disharmony in the stomach qi. </p>
<p>Indeed, when color is observed in the pulse patterns—be it yellow, red, purple, or blue—this indicates that the illness is severe, with colors capable of changing according to the severity of the affliction.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

<p>There are also distinctions in the shapes of the pulse: for the long pearl shape, it indicates accumulated damage and stagnation, causing abdominal pain, and difficulty digesting cold and hot foods; for the snake shape, it indicates disharmony at the center, accumulated qi attacking, organs in disarray, and dry heaving; for the outgoing snake shape, it indicates spleen deficiency with cold accumulation leading to diarrhea, causing the spirit to feel lethargic and sleepy. The reverse bow shape indicates the invasion of cold and hot evil energy, with heaviness in the head and eyes, the heart disturbed and weary, cold in the limbs, and red urination. The outward bow shape indicates phlegm-heat causing mental confusion, presenting symptoms of heat, shock, and food wind convulsions. The spear shape indicates strong phlegm-heat producing wind, causing convulsions and shocks. The fishbone shape indicates startled phlegm-heat. The water character shape indicates shock and accumulated heat causing agitation, the spirit feeling lost and heavy, night crying with excessive phlegm, and mouth twitching. The needle shape indicates heat affecting the heart and lungs, extreme heat giving rise to wind, causing fright and discomfort, with lethargy and loss of appetite, and strong phlegm leading to twitching. The penetrating pulse of the shooting finger indicates four symptoms of wind, phlegm, and heat, all concentrated in the chest and diaphragm without dispersing. The penetrating pulse of the shooting nail indicates wind shock and adverse conditions, with the shock transmitted into the meridians.

<p>When a child is born until the age of five, their blood and qi are not yet stable, and their breathing may be excessive. One must observe the pulse color at the tiger mouth to discern the true nature of the illness. For boys, check the left hand, and for girls, the right hand. The left hand corresponds to yang, which is dominant in boys; the right hand corresponds to yin, which is dominant in girls. However, both men and women possess both yin and yang in their bodies, and both hands should be examined. The patterns on the left hand indicate issues with the heart and liver; the patterns on the right hand indicate issues with the lungs and spleen. Understanding this information allows for adaptability in diagnosis. </p>
<p>For initial cases of frightful wind, the pattern at the tiger mouth may appear red, often more so at the initial phase. If it progresses to the middle phase, the color turns bright red and purple. If the illness continues to worsen, the color becomes purple-blue, signaling deeper illness. A pattern that is blue-black with disordered pulse lines indicates serious ailment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, red indicates mild wind-heat, while bright red denotes severe wind-heat. Purple suggests sudden heat, and green indicates sudden accumulation. When green and red are equally present, it signifies both sudden accumulation and wind-heat, suggesting an urgent need to address sudden wind symptoms. If there is a pale purple with green, characterized by movements back and forth, it indicates slow onset of wind symptoms. In cases where purple threads, green threads, and black threads are subtly mixed, appearing intermittently, it indicates a chronic spleen wind condition. </p>
<p>If the pulse pattern starts at the yin gate and does not reach the mao gate, the illness is relatively easy to treat; however, if it connects to the mao gate, the condition is difficult to treat. If it connects from the yin gate to the mao gate and then invades beyond the chen gate, the prognosis is extremely poor, with a one in ten chance of recovery. </p>
<p>If the pulse pattern is small or short, there is no harm in examining the illness. If the pulse waves curve inward, while the illness may be severe, the condition shows conformity and can still be treated with effort. However, if the pulse waves bow outward and are closely linked to the nail, it should not be reversed.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing the Patterns of Pulse in the Tiger&#39;s Mouth</strong></p>
<p>Yellow, formless, indicates the pulse of tranquility. Red, if similarly formless, also signifies a peaceful pulse. Patterns resembling earlier forms indicate illness. They change in sequence, beginning with a dot, gradually increasing in the qi gate with more pulse lines, reaching the life gate when the condition becomes critical. Pure black is distinct and cannot be treated.</p>
<p>On the left, if there are red lines resembling lines, it indicates fever accompanied by shock. On the right, if there are double lines resembling those on the left, it is a sign of spleen injury with shock accumulation. If the ends of the lines resemble a trident, it suggests lung qi producing phlegm that manifests at night. The blue also corresponds to cold damage but is simply empty red producing leakage.</p>
<p>Identifying blue lines on the fingers indicates sudden fright. The blue pulse in the tiger&#39;s mouth indicates fright from pigs, dogs, or horses. Black suggests shock from water, while red indicates fright in adults. Purple often leads to diarrhea, whereas yellow signifies fright from thunder. Curved back wind greatly intensifies; bow-shaped patterns indicate food reverse.</p>
<p>One can discern the shape only by observing the intersection of fingers. For children over three years old, if gravely ill or in critical condition, one often observes black coloring around the nails, mouth, and nose. This indicates an absolute pulse where the spirit is trapped, and the condition is extremely severe; even with skilled doctors, recovery is virtually impossible.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Treatment</h3>
<p>Children have a pure Yang constitution, and both Yin and Yang must not be harmed. They often carry a little hunger and coolness; such children are easy to nurture. Generally, the spleen is often insufficient, while excess liver energy must be guarded against. Neutral medicine, neither cold nor hot, is best; it is essential to avoid reckless and violent treatments.  </p>
<p>Why are children difficult to treat? Historically, it is referred to as the &quot;mute disease.&quot; The pulse cannot be observed easily, and the child cannot express their illness. Parents are often anxious, and physicians conduct many tests with sincerity. It is challenging to prescribe medicine confidently when faced with such uncertainty.</p>
<h3>Treatise on the Forehead, Center of the Brow, and Mountain Root</h3>
<p>When the forehead is red, hot, and dry, a blue color may indicate liver wind. A green hue at the center of the brow signifies fear, resulting in redness due to fire. If suddenly black qi appears, it is a result of external evil influencing the body. A faint green shade at the mountain root suggests that shock can double the severity.

<p><strong>On the Arch of the Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The arch of the mouth appears blue, indicative of shock when eating, with much yellow leading to reverse vomiting and red dysentery manifestations. Nighttime restlessness and crying show a blue color indicating good fortune, whereas prolonged illness with red brows signals certain death.</p>
<p><strong>On the Wind and Qi Pools at the Mandibles</strong></p>
<p>The wind and qi pools display yellow reverse vomiting, with anxiety and cries revealing a bright red hue. The two mandibles can also appear red as buds, suggesting that heat in the lungs is not without reason.</p>
<p><strong>On the Eyes</strong></p>
<p>The whites of the eyes show blue due to liver wind; should they turn yellow, it indicates stagnation. Observing black in the pupils with yellow trace reveals the source of the severe cold illness.</p>
<p><strong>On the Nose</strong></p>
<p>The nose tip is slightly yellow, balancing with a red-white hue; deep yellow dryness leads to a hazardous black indicating difficulty in survival. A shortened philtrum suggests vomiting due to dysentery, while darkened lips indicate worms leaning towards danger.</p>
<p><strong>On the Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth&#39;s natural redness suggests balance, while dryness denotes spleen heat generating a yellow accumulation. White indicates blood loss, with black encircling the mouth; a blue-black hue signifies shock from wind leading to certain death.</p>

<p>When facing a child&#39;s ailments, first observe their shape and color, then proceed to pulse examination. The overall facial color can indicate various conditions: a blueish hue points to fear or an imbalance of energy; a reddish tint indicates phlegm accumulation or restlessness; yellowness suggests food blockage leading to digestive issues; paleness points to weak lung energy, resulting in excess discharge or diarrhea; a blackish hue indicates critical issues with internal organs. </p>
<p>A blue face with blue eyes indicates liver ailments; a red face reflects heart issues; a pale face relates to lung conditions; a yellow face corresponds to spleen problems; and a black face indicates kidney concerns. First, distinguish which organ is affected; next, assess their balance of energy, the state of their prenatal vitality, and the conditions of yin and yang.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret of Raising Infants</strong> by Wan Quan (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Essay on Subtlety</strong></p>
<p>The field of medicine is vast, and pediatrics is the most challenging. Just as the shoots of grass are precious in their nurturing, so too must we be cautious in preserving the sprouts of silkworms. When the blood and qi are not fully developed, the pulses cannot be diagnosed; when the spirit is not awakened, the infant cannot speak. Truly seeking from the heart, one must carefully observe the face. If one grasps the essentials, they can wield the forces of creation with masterful hands; if one does not comprehend the purpose, they merely extract phrases from a fragmented text. </p>
<p>If care is neglected, illness will arise. The head should be cool while the back must be warm; do not overfeed, and do not dress in too much fabric. The intestines and stomach are delicate, and excessive nursing can cause accumulation; if the spirit is timid and weak, strange sights and sounds can induce convulsions. Alas, kind mothers, being overly indulgent, and mocking those with clumsy methods, make mistakes with porridge and pills. They suppress the vital energy of growth, jeopardizing the childhood years. Crying out on the hills and fields is futile, and praying for relief at altars is pointless. </p>
<p>To recognize symptoms is crucial, and knowledge of life and death is essential. It does not lie near the fingertips, but relies on the face in between. When heart fire ascends, one can observe at the crown; when kidney water descends, one should observe at the soles. The right cheek is gold and pertains to the lungs, the left cheek is wood and pertains to the liver. The spleen&#39;s territory is between the nose and the bridge. Blue indicates fright and red signifies heat; yellow represents accumulation and white signals dysentery. Like the black of coal, it points to malice; like the purple of ochre, it indicates an invasion of wind and cold. </p>
<p>If the prenatal constitution is weak, the hair will be sparse and the head soft; if the constitution is robust, the flesh will be ample and the bones strong. If the nature is calm, there will be little laughter; if the spirit is weary, there will be much sleep.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heat in the lungs causes turbid mucus to accumulate in the nose; cold in the spleen leads to clear saliva stagnating in the jaws. The eyes are linked and speak of liver wind; the pupils gaze straight, reflecting the flame of the heart&#39;s fire. When energy is insufficient, the spirit sinks; if it rises, it indicates heat. Excess blood gives a flushed face, while a pale yellow complexion indicates deficiency.</p>
<p>Those who move slowly show weak kidneys; those who cry frequently are troubled at heart. A hot spleen causes tongue movements, while a strong liver results in clenched fists. Hair standing on end signals the gradual rise of consumption; a cracking head suggests a possible collapse. Skin tightens while flesh withers, signifying a loss of vital energy and an impending departure; an elevated nose and retracted lips show that the essence of grains has been cut off and is difficult to regain. A red worm enters the eye, no need to consult Lu Bian; a green snake coils around the mouth, no need to ask about the divine pill!</p>
<p>Each organ has its symptoms, which can be understood in a word. The liver governs wind, causing crying and frustration; the heart controls heat, leading to palpitations and yawning. The lungs govern qi, resulting in wheezing, coughing, and sneezing; the spleen governs feelings of heaviness, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and desire for sleep. Only the kidneys are inherently deficient, being connected to life. The liver often has excess, which generates wind; the spleen is frequently insufficient, leading to deficiency disorders. Wood overpowering earth leads to prolonged diarrhea and spasms that cannot be treated; fire affecting metal causes persistent coughs that result in a debilitating condition.</p>
<p>Within a month, the umbilical wind is most dangerous; within a century, phlegm and coughs are particularly difficult. There is no condition more perilous than a mid-illness crisis; no urgency greater than flowing dan (a type of poison). If transformation is exhausted during the year, it must be measured by the days. If convulsions arise in a timely manner, it is hard to depend on days for relief. Those who suffer will groan; those who lose what they desire will sigh in despair.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

<p>Those born with illness suffer from fetal toxins; those who can eat but are ill suffer from food accumulation. The changes from fetal toxins manifest as jaundice, tumors, and sores; the changes from food accumulation show as symptoms of pain and a feeling of fullness. Vomiting and diarrhea can be caused by cold or heat or food, while coughing may stem from deficiency, excess, or phlegm. Dysentery arises from accumulation, while malaria persists due to fullness. </p>
<p>Bloating is due to deficiency of the spleen and stomach, while swelling results from wind and dampness. Hernias originate in the liver, while painful urination is due to heat in the bladder; jaundice arises from the spleen, and thirst is due to dryness of fluids. </p>
<p>Wind arises from the liver, and heat dwells in the heart. When wind and heat combine, it causes severe spasms; prolonged vomiting and diarrhea result in a chronic state. Conditions can be classified into eight signs, and thorough treatment is critical. If phlegm has not been eliminated, there will be difficulty in speaking; if qi and blood have not been restored, there will be contractions of the limbs. </p>
<p>There may be a hanging sensation that feels like a spasm and shoots upward; internal hanging sensations can feel like a hernia or cause internal pain. A slight disturbance may feel like inner malaise; pain from parasites resembles convulsions. When signs and symptoms are confused with one another, diagnosis and treatment should be detailed and careful.</p>
<p>A white membrane in the eyes indicates a liver disorder; redness and ulcers below the nose signify a lung condition. Intense heat and thirst suggest evil fire attacking the palace of crimson; numerous sores and emaciation indicate the depletion of true fluids at the source. Injuries to diet lead to spleen damage; loss of fluids results in a dry stomach.

The symptoms of illness are clear, and the treatment method is simple. To regulate the stomach and dry dampness, use Wuling and Pingwei, combining them to relieve both vomiting and diarrhea; for purging heat and dispelling wind, using the two formulas can also alleviate sudden convulsions. The coolness of golden flowers reduces fever, while the soothing jade liquid transforms phlegm. To harmonize the body and relieve accumulation, using Tongxiang can treat dysentery; while Yigong can nourish the spleen, assisting in the recovery from tuberculosis. To stop vomiting and diarrhea, with common strategies for both cold and heat, protecting life and calming sudden seizures, managing acute and chronic issues together. Embracing the dragon addresses sudden wind and resolves phlegm fire; clarity dispels transformations, dispersing wind and cold. Good for the spleen and treating malaria, especially for those with chronic complications; cardamom stops diarrhea, while those with long-term leaks balance the root. White Atractylodes cures thirst due to deficiency, while cloves are a miraculous remedy for parasitic accumulation. Five colors expel internal heat, three saints clear phlegm obstructing the diaphragm. For sores of the mouth and tongue, cleanse the heart; for acute pain in the chest and ribs, control the saliva. Ginseng and Poria nourish children; do not neglect those with severe spleen deficiency; Rehmannia supplements the kidneys, beneficial for those with weak constitution. </p>
<p>Ah! Infants are fragile; how can they withstand harsh medications? Skilled practitioners of medicine especially value precision and specialization. Whether supplementing or purging, treatment should be immediately halted in case of wrong conditions; it’s easy to shift between deficiency and excess, so one must not offend the signs.

<p>There is a saying among people: the children of the rich who are often sick have clear vital energies and thin bodies, and they tend to be overindulged in warmth and food. In contrast, the children of the poor who are seldom sick have turbid vital energies and robust bodies, often enduring hunger and cold. A truly wise physician understands this principle, observing the parents to discern the thickness or thinness of their vital energies, and examining appearance to know the fullness or emptiness of the organs. Harsh or vigorous medicines should not be carelessly applied, nor should gentle remedies be used indiscriminately. The song says: &quot;A physician who does not cling to conventions is a true master, capable of understanding the differences between wealth and poverty.&quot; From birth, vital energies are divided into clear and turbid; residing in different circumstances, they also change accordingly.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Diseases of Infancy: Foetal Disorders, Food Accumulation, and External Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>Infants often initially suffer from foetal disorders, and excessive eating leads to food accumulation. These two aspects serve as a framework for further discussion. </p>
<p>Diseases in infants, such as smallpox, measles, umbilical wind, eruptions, jaundice, parasitic infections, convulsions, and conditions characterized by weakness, are all considered foetal disorders. In contrast, conditions like vomiting, diarrhea, malaria, swelling, food accumulation, and malnutrition are due to food injury. Only fever and cough, or cases involving external pathogens of wind and cold, are exceptions. Thus, it is said: among infants, 40% of illnesses are due to foetal toxins, 50% due to food injury, and 10-12% due to external pathogens. </p>
<p>Seizures and convulsions arise from an excess in the liver, while the spleen is often insufficient, leading to malnutrition. A lack of development indicates a weakness in the kidneys, and skilled physicians should be mindful of these initial signs. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, infants are characterized by an insufficient spleen and an excess in the liver. The kidneys are primarily weak and also insufficient. Therefore, in discussing infantile diseases, seizures are related to the liver, malnutrition to the spleen, and insufficient foetal energy to the kidneys. A skilled physician must first understand the underlying conditions to prevent illness, hence the saying: “Do not treat existing diseases; treat latent ones.”<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Three Traditional Methods of Treating Children</strong></p>
<p>The three family methods save children; for seizures, one must use the &quot;Embrace the Dragon&quot; technique. When the constitution is weak, it is appropriate to strengthen the kidneys, and for fat children with chronic diseases, there is remarkable efficacy. </p>
<p>To treat seizures, use the &quot;Amber Embrace the Dragon Pill,&quot; for dysentery use the &quot;Fat Child Pill,&quot; and for insufficient prenatal constitution use the &quot;Kidney-Replenishing Rehmannia Pill.&quot; These three formulas have been passed down through generations, respected and upheld by descendants.</p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing Longevity from Premature Death</strong></p>
<p>Expert knowledge in pediatrics is essential; understanding longevity and premature death is crucial. Observing the color and pulse reveals the condition of the five organs, allowing one to use tonics and purgatives effectively. </p>
<p>As the ancient saying goes: &quot;Three bends of the indeed is a good doctor,&quot; indicating that experience is key. Therefore, a specialist in pediatrics can recognize a child’s potential for longevity or premature death at a glance. If a condition is beyond cure, it will remain uncured. When faced with sickness, observing the form and color allows diagnosis of the five organs, leading to appropriate treatment with tonics or purgatives, revealing remarkable insights.</p>
<p>It is particularly challenging to understand a child’s potential longevity; it relies on a skilled practitioner’s keen eye. Adequate form and energy indicate a propensity for longevity, while deficiency suggests premature death. A child’s life derives its energy from the father and its form from the mother. If both parents are robust, the child’s form and energy are abundant; if both are weak, the child’s form and energy are deficient. If the father is strong and the mother weak, energy may be abundant while form is lacking; conversely, if the father is weak and the mother strong, form may be sufficient while energy is lacking.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, lifespan, fortune, intelligence, and foolishness are all predetermined; how can one escape this? The attributes of a child rely entirely on the residual energy from their parents for their physical growth; thus, a fat child cannot be born from thin parents, nor can a thin child be born from fat parents. If the child&#39;s traits do not align with those of the parents, it becomes difficult to nurture them. Although there may be many issues in their early life, if their physique is appropriate, they tend to have a longer lifespan. A child with a relaxed face and slow head movements, requiring some effort to shape, is a sign of longevity. However, a child who intuitively understands others&#39; intentions, while physically weak and light, is difficult to nurture. The ancients said that like an early-blooming plum flower, which does not witness the cold of the year, or a late-blooming chrysanthemum, which thrives at the end of the year, one knows that late bloomers are a sign of longevity. If a child has a small, dark complexion that is proportionate to their body, they can be nurtured. If the child has a large, pale complexion, it is difficult to nurture them. If a child&#39;s physique is weak, the face has many pale spots, and they seem lethargic, they are hard to foster. Conversely, a child who is robust, with bright eyes, a healthy spirit, glossy skin, and good complexion shows signs of longevity. If a child&#39;s spirit is strong, they tend to suffer from fewer illnesses, making them easier to raise. However, if they appear worn and are frequently ill, they are difficult to nurture. A child with fewer dark pupils and more white in their eyes, along with a pale complexion, is not a sign of longevity, for even if they grow, they may not reach old age. If a child has large dark pupils and fewer whites, with a dark complexion that is rich and full, one should also observe the clarity of the black and white in their eyes; if they are balanced, this is a sign of health and longevity. If the dark pupils are unstable and shine brightly, even if they grow, they are expected to have eye ailments and may not live to their forties. Their head is round, the back is thick, the abdomen is like a droop, the eyes are elegant, the eyebrows are clear, and the nose is straight and proportionate.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Differentiating Appearance and Color</strong></p>
<p>When a child is ill, observe their appearance and color: a blue hue indicates a shock from wind, red suggests heat, yellow implies food injury, and white indicates malnutrition. If affected by evil influences, the face will appear black. The liver governs wind, and its color is blue; the heart governs heat, and its color is red; the spleen governs grains, and its color is yellow. White represents a deficiency in qi and blood in the face, hence it suggests malnutrition. Black is an ominous color, indicating the influence of evil.</p>
<p>The complexion should be observed according to different regions: the heart influences the forehead, producing a red fiery glow; the left cheek corresponds to wood (liver), while the right cheek relates to metal (lung); the chin signifies the kidneys and the nose relates to the spleen. </p>
<p>These five forms correspond to their respective locations: the liver belongs to wood and the east, thus it is observed on the left cheek. The lung is associated with metal and the west, therefore it is checked on the right cheek. The heart pertains to fire and the south, hence it is examined on the forehead. The kidneys relate to water and the north, thus observed at the chin. The spleen corresponds to earth and the center, hence assessed at the nose.</p>
<p>Liver illnesses should be observed in the eyes, while the spleen and heart connect through the lips and tongue. Lung issues often appear in the nose, and kidney problems are discerned from the ears. </p>
<p>This relates the five openings to the five organs. Liver disease manifests in the eyes, heart disease appears on the tongue, spleen disease is visible on the lips, lung disease is apparent in the nose, and kidney disease can be seen in the ears, each determined by cold or heat, deficiency or excess. </p>
<p>If the eyes are raised and the face is red and hot, it signifies wind; furrowed brows and groaning indicate abdominal pain. A yellow swollen face may suggest a spleen condition, while sparse hair and a pale face may imply parasitic infestation.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

A saying goes: with dysentery, the brow furrows, and there is pain in the intestines. The spleen governs dampness; when dampness prevails, there will be swelling, and if the face is swollen and yellow, it indicates spleen disease. Accumulation of undigested food leads to chronic issues. Malnutrition is a disease of insufficient fluids. Sparse hair and a pale face indicate blood deficiency. Malnutrition often leads to parasites.</p>
<p>In cases of diarrhea, one should be wary if the complexion is fair; if the face is red due to sudden wind, that is also concerning. A pale face with cough indicates true color; blue around the lips and bluish veins signify issues. A saying states: if diarrhea is unpredictable but the spirit is good, it leads to death.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Differentiating Pulse and Breath</strong></p>
<p>For young children, their innate vital energy is still intact, so a pulse felt under the fingers should be strong. A large and slippery pulse that is numerous is most desirable, while a fine, thin, and slow pulse indicates deficiency, which is never auspicious. A large pulse indicates sufficient energy; a slippery pulse indicates strong blood. Six beats per breath signify a strong pulse, representative of an abundance. Conversely, a thin pulse signifies energy deficiency, and a weak pulse indicates blood deficiency. A pulse that reaches three beats on inhalation is considered slow and deficient, lacking strength; these are signs of insufficiency.</p>
<p>In assessing children&#39;s lifespans, this method of differentiation is used. A pulse that is six beats per breath indicates harmony; the notion of eight beats should not be relied upon. Four beats or less signify a state of deficiency and cold, while eight, nine, or ten beats indicate heat, leading to agitation.</p>
<p>A child&#39;s pulse typically corresponds to one breath with three beats on inhalation and three beats on exhalation, collectively termed &quot;one breath.&quot; Six beats per breath represent a harmonious and healthy pulse. The rule states: do not rely on eight beats as a sign of balance. Four beats per breath are termed &quot;leaving the canonical,&quot; while three beats or fewer denote &quot;diminished pulse,&quot; associated with cold, imbalanced conditions. Conversely, eight beats per breath signify “leaving the canonical,” while nine beats and above indicate a &quot;full pulse,&quot; linked to excess heat and convulsions.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Differentiating Pulses and Treating Symptoms</h3>
<p>The foremost physician must understand both complexion and pulse thoroughly; the treatment of deficiency and excess must be applied according to the method. If there is one deviation, it will not be effective, leading to calamity for the child and transgressing heavenly laws. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: being able to unify color and pulse ensures complete well-being. The highest physician treats children by correlating color with pulse and pulse with color; if it is excess, treat with purgatives; if it is deficiency, treat with tonics; if it does not deviate, then regulate it — this is the path to complete health.</p>
<p>For instance, if the cheeks are red, it indicates excess color; if the pulse is rapid and forceful, it indicates excess pulse; constipation with yellow urine, unquenchable thirst, rapid breathing, and heat in the legs all signify an excess condition. When these three signs of excess are present, cold and cooling medicines should be used to purge. There are seven situations wherein warm medicine should not be administered.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the face appears pale, it indicates deficient color; if the pulse is weak and deep, it indicates deficient pulse; bluish stools, abdominal distention, spitting up milk, blue scleras, and coldness in the legs indicate deficiency. When these three signs of deficiency are present, warm and nourishing medicines should be used to tonify. There are seven situations wherein cold medicine should not be administered. </p>
<p>Currently, inexperienced practitioners know nothing of color, pulse, and symptom treatment, carelessly concocting decoctions and pills, endangering children&#39;s lives, and the heavens will surely punish such actions. Medicines must correspond accurately to the symptoms without error, and the condition must not exceed moderation. Wait until the true qi returns fully and nourishment is sufficient to support recovery.</p>
<p>This is what is meant by the essential techniques in treating illnesses.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In treating conditions based on color and pulse, one must understand these principles in the heart: thus, cold conditions are treated with heat, and hot conditions with cold. In reality, for excess conditions, one drains, and for deficiency conditions, one supplements; all are methods and remedies to control disease. After taking medicine, if the illness has already diminished, one should not exceed the prescribed dosage. This aligns with the teachings from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; which states that for severe toxicity, one should reduce the treatment by a third; for moderate toxicity, reduce by half; and for non-toxic conditions, reduce by seven tenths. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; also states that when a condition is waning, one should wait for its recovery, meaning when the illness has diminished by half, one should stop the medication to allow the true vital energy to recover, supplemented by nourishing food to aid this recovery. It is said in a proverb that food supplements are preferable to medicinal supplements—a truth that coarse practitioners fail to understand. They attack cold with heat, causing internal heat to arise before the cold has dissipated; they counter heat with cold, allowing cold to set in before the heat has subsided. How can one expect recovery? The basis of premature death certainly starts here. These treatment principles are what I strictly adhere to in practice.</p>
<p>When prescribing for children, one must choose only the finest remedies, for even the slightest toxic substance is unacceptable. If pathogenic energy has not been eliminated and vital energy is depleted, it is pitiful how fragile young sprouts cannot withstand frost. </p>
<p>The &quot;fine&quot; refers to medicines that are mild, balanced, and non-toxic, while &quot;toxic&quot; refers to harsh and caustic medicines that may cause dizziness or impairment. Therefore, remedies for children should actually drain excess, such as those that clear the green bile, guide out the red bile, drain the white bile, or eliminate the yellow bile; if deficient, one should supplement, such as tranquilizing with substances like antler gelatin or rehmannia. Remedies that cool heat, regulate cold, treat convulsions, or nourish children to combat malnutrition are all gentle and non-toxic, and these are my family&#39;s secret formulas. While substances like croton and morning glory are not never used, I am cautious and do not resort to them as primary remedies.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I see that those who practice pediatrics today use various toxic medicines: sulfur to treat phlegm, arsenic for malaria, and other powerful substances. These are highly toxic drugs, and children&#39;s digestive systems are delicate; how can they withstand such poisons? </p>
<p>When treating children, do not lightly induce sweating, as genuine conditions will be harmed. Mistaking the treatment for cold and heat can lead to excessive harm, while warming the middle and detoxifying can provide miraculous effects. </p>
<p>According to Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s principles for treating cold damage: when one should not sweat but is made to sweat, it signifies a condition of rash with excessive sweating; this can lead to severe outcomes. When one should not be purged but is, this indicates ailments of abdominal fullness, pain, vomiting, and uncontrollable diarrhea; excessive purging can lead to dire consequences. </p>
<p>When a child is ill, do not purge unless there is fever, sweating, or spontaneous diarrhea. Signs of distress include cold limbs, weak spirit, dry retching, and fear. </p>
<p>Symptoms like vomiting roundworms, pale face, hair loss, failure to digest food, nasal congestion, coughing, and thin phlegm indicate a troubled pulse and anxiety. If there is accumulation of waste, it is genuinely alarming. </p>
<p>If a child shows true heat, purging does no harm; they may have a flushed face, red eyes, and strong energy. The pulse feels tense, and the abdomen is hot; there may be throat pain and urine resembling broth. Hard stools, abdominal bloating, fullness in the sides, and swollen limbs, coupled with nighttime crying, may signify severe underlying issues that require treatment. </p>
<p>If a child suffers from the excessive use of cooling medicines, it can lead to weakened spleen and stomach and pain in the stomach area; warming the stomach is appropriate here. Conversely, if heat medicines have been overused, causing agitation, restlessness, vomiting, madness, or thirst, detoxification is needed first, and a drink of mung bean powder should be given.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a child suffers from fright, it is common to treat them with excessively warm or heating medications. There are instances where, even before the fright resolves, another heat condition emerges; others may have recovered from the illness yet develop heat symptoms, or the condition may worsen into a severe fright. When asking the patient over the days about how the condition arose and which medicines were used, detoxifying medications can be applied with effectiveness. The bean roll powder can be used for this.</p>
<p>When fever arises, if the patient is not alert, they may trust ghosts or divine spirits rather than the physician. It is unheard of that rituals by dragon wood or shamanic practices can resolve someone’s fright through animal sacrifice.</p>
<p>The classics say: those who are confused by ghosts and spirits are not worth discussing profound virtues with. Hence, there is a caution against believing in shamans while ignoring doctors. The traditions conveyed through shamanic practices are merely techniques of transforming essence and altering qi. Prayer to spirits often involves animal sacrifice, but of what benefit is that?</p>
<p>One should not speak openly of their illness; treatment requires focused intention. From the beginning, the three methods should be memorized, and care should be taken not to harm the spleen and stomach, which could lead to complications.</p>
<p>An ancient saying goes: If an illness cannot be treated, one should reveal it early, and not endure it in silence to avoid being ridiculed. This statement holds true. If the illness can be treated, one should care for the child as they would for their own. Nurturing and providing care must be thorough. There are three approaches: first, use vigorous methods to drive away the illness; one should not excessively attack while favoring supplements, as this will only aid the evil and harm the child. Second, apply a combination of vigorous and gentle methods; if the illness lingers, food intake must be limited, and the spleen and stomach weakened, so in spleen supplements, add medicinal ingredients to address the illness, adjusting according to the child’s strength. Lastly, gentle methods should be employed; if the child has been ill for a long time, it could lead to malnutrition, focusing primarily on nourishing the spleen and stomach will ensure that the right qi is strengthened, which will cause the evil qi to dissipate naturally.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From the age of one to three, one should observe the pulse at the tigertail position, applying the finger to press the higher segments. Thus, one finger divides into three sections to determine the pulse rate. A breath count of eight indicates a normal pulse, nine indicates unease, and ten indicates a dangerous condition. Each pulse&#39;s length and size reflects various ailments. A floating pulse indicates wind, a rapid pulse suggests fright, a slow and deep pulse signifies deficiency and coldness, a strong pulse indicates heat, a tight pulse suggests convulsions, a full pulse indicates excessive heat, a deep and thin pulse suggests abdominal pain, a slow and deep pulse indicates deficiency and diarrhea, a faint and slow pulse suggests accumulation or worms, a slow and thick pulse indicates disharmony in the stomach, a deep pulse suggests difficulty in digesting milk, a deep and thin pulse suggests milk accumulation, a tight and wiry pulse indicates abdominal heat and pain, a firm pulse indicates constipation, and a deep but rapid pulse suggests internal heat in the bones. A long and wiry pulse suggests wind in the liver and diaphragm, a tight and rapid pulse indicates convulsions and spasms, a floating and full pulse indicates heat in the stomach, a deep and tight pulse suggests persistent abdominal pain, a weak and soft pulse implies a mix of energy deficiency and slow fright, and a wide pulse with frequent diarrhea indicates blood in the stool. </p>
<p>At four years old, one should use one finger to press on the fullness and emptiness; at five and six, one should roll the finger to explore the three positions, with a normalized pulse at the central spot. At seven and eight, one should slightly adjust the finger to explore the three positions. At nine and ten, one should sequentially examine the locations corresponding to the three sections. At eleven and twelve, one examines similarly to the ten-year-olds. At fourteen and fifteen, one should examine according to the larger pulse positions. </p>
<p>In all pulse examinations, one must first determine floating or deep, slow or rapid, and the balance of yin and yang, hot and cold, all in relation to the larger pulse. A deep and slow pulse represents yin, while a floating and rapid pulse represents yang. It is also essential to examine facial color: a bluish tone indicates fright, a pale tone indicates deficiency and diarrhea, a reddish tone indicates phlegm-heat, a blackish tone suggests a grave condition, and a yellow tone indicates spleen-related accumulation. Utilizing this method to analyze the symptoms will yield accurate assessments for treatment, ensuring nothing is overlooked.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

The fiery red color suggests a buildup of phlegm, leading to increased anxiety. The yellowish-brown color reflects digestive issues, possibly indicating the onset of illnesses like scrofula. The pale color indicates that the large intestine is leaking, disrupting the differentiation of fluids, possibly leading to vomiting and diarrhea.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The red dominates and brings great heat; the blue at the center of the forehead first causes shock and leads to a discharge. The red is greatly alarmed and cries out at night, while the black indicates a guest&#39;s opposition. The blue at the root of the nose leads to a second shock. Blue signifies discharge followed by agitation, and excessive black and yellow indicate death. If one’s lifespan is level and falls, it indicates premature death. Blue signifies fever and shock; black indicates dysentery leading to death, while red indicates death from dryness. A slight yellow indicates balance; excessive yellow signifies death from cholera. Pale yellow at the nasal tip suggests balance, while excessive yellow indicates death from soil disturbance, with black and red indicating extreme danger. The black at the philtrum indicates worm bites; prolonged lip reversal indicates death, while shortness indicates death from benefits. Yellow at the edges suggests gastric reflux, while blue indicates diarrhea. A healthy red mouth indicates balance with dry spleen heat; white suggests death from blood loss, while yellow suggests accumulation. Blue due to shock from wind results in death; black gas around the mouth suggests death. Blue at the chin, arising from shock during meals, indicates yellow, leading to vomiting or reflux, while red indicates bloody dysentery; red and black suggest shock from wind. Both eyes have black and yellow indicating heat; white sclera signifies undigested food causing sores or roundworms; white with blue indicates liver wind and shock, while black sclera with yellow indicates typhoid. Blue above the eyebrows is auspicious; sudden redness indicates agitation and night cries, while yellow suggests cholera and prolonged redness indicates death. The two pools of wind energy with blue indicate wind conditions; purple suggests vomiting or fever, yellow indicates reflux, and red indicates agitation with night cries. Both cheeks are red, indicating heat in the lungs; both temples with blue indicate a second shock; blue entering the ears suggests death, while red indicates bloody urination. Both sides of the face being blue indicate guest opposition; yellow suggests phlegm overflow, and red indicates wind heat. Both cheeks in red indicate typhoid; left side red suggests heart heat and mouth sores, while the right side red indicates lung heat. Yellow signifies accumulation, while red suggests bloody urination; both jaws of blue indicate vomiting of worms. Both &quot;golden stores&quot; in blue suggest a third shock leading to wind. Black around the mouth indicates death in two days; blue connecting the eyes to the ears indicates death in seven days. Both wind gates in red suggest wind heat; black indicates hernia, while blue signifies shock from water. Black entering from the eyebrows indicates death on the same day; black lips indicating refusal to eat suggests death. Additionally, a blue face with blue eyes indicates liver disease; a red face indicates heart disease; a white face suggests lung disease; a yellow face indicates spleen disease, and a black face signifies kidney disease. Each of the five organs has its own significance, and one must observe the balance of excess and deficiency, the state of the fetus, the yin and yang flow, and respond to losses. The organs face inward and outward; if one can distinguish between the superficial and the fundamental, then divine knowledge and skill can naturally be attained.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Diagram of the Head and Face Regions</strong></p>
<p>See the image<br>[Illustration Explanation]<br>The head is where various Yang meridians converge; the face reflects the nourishment of the five organs&#39; qi and blood. Color represents the spirit of the five organs. To discern a child&#39;s illness or well-being, one must first distinguish the positions of growth and decline. When the five organs are weak, the complexion will certainly appear shriveled; when the five colors are full, the complexion will be bright. A vibrant complexion indicates life, while a withered complexion indicates death. Since observation precedes diagnosis, it is said: the ability to observe color and pulse can lead to comprehensive well-being. According to &quot;Complete Reflection on Childhood,&quot; if a child is ill within six months, one should press three fingers horizontally on the forehead, between the eyebrows and hairline. </p>
<p>When the child&#39;s head is raised on the left, use the right hand; when raised on the right, use the left hand. The index finger represents the upper area, the middle finger the middle area, and the ring finger the lower area. If all three fingers are hot, it indicates the invasion of wind pathogenic factors, with symptoms like nasal congestion, rough breathing, fever, and cough. If all three fingers are cold, it suggests external invasion and internal damage, with symptoms like fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. If the index and middle fingers are hot, it indicates heat above and cold below; if the middle finger is hot, it suggests a shock; if only the index finger is hot, it indicates fullness in the chest; if only the ring finger is hot, it suggests undigested milk or food.</p>
<p>I privately assert that a red forehead indicates heart wind heat, leading to agitation and uneasiness. If there is fever and thirst for water, or if the child cries incessantly, it pertains to real heat in the heart meridian, and one should use a cooling heart decoction to clear heart fire.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is pain associated with urination or defecation, it is particularly a sign of deficiency. One should use the previously mentioned medicine, adding Achyranthes bidentata, Plantago seeds, and cinnamon to alleviate it. If hands and feet are cold and there is fear of cold and reduced appetite, it indicates a deficiency of Yang energy and coldness; therefore, one should urgently add a larger dosage of Aconite root if there is vitality. Generally, in children&#39;s cases, many arise from inherent imbalances in the organs, improper food and season, or from the six excesses and seven emotions impacting pregnant women and nursing mothers. </p>
<p>If initially, the vital energy is not depleted, and food intake is normal, yet there is high fever, constipation, thirst for water, and sleeping with eyes open, this indicates substantial illness and requires treatment for the pathogenic qi. If the condition has persisted, with diminished vital energy, reduced food intake, fever, dry mouth, vomiting, diarrhea, cold intolerance in limbs, and sleeping with eyes open, this indicates a substantial illness due to deficiency, and one should tonify the vital qi. </p>
<p>Moreover, the vital energy in today&#39;s children differs from that of the past; inappropriate medication can harm the spleen and stomach, so one cannot simply adhere to ancient prescriptions in treatment. Therefore, I have referred to renowned experts and followed the teachings of the Eastern Garden, supplementing with appropriate prescriptions for various symptoms. A practitioner ought to observe the patient’s complexion to assess their condition, examine the illness to strengthen the root, and this will yield no mistakes. Thus, in ancient medicine, checking the complexion was paramount. Furthermore, when startled, the qi disperses and the pulse becomes disordered, so one cannot focus solely on diagnosis and must also examine the complexion. The &quot;Heart Mirror&quot; states: if the facial color is incomplete, one should also consult the pulse; if the pulse is incomplete, one should look at the facial color; when both color and pulse are fully evaluated, there remains no hidden condition.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Facial Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>A blue complexion indicates lingering fright that has not dispersed, signaling a potential wind condition. Red denotes phlegm accumulation and anxiety. Yellow suggests food stagnation affecting the body, indicating the onset of intestinal ailments. A pale complexion points to diarrhea from food and drink, possibly leading to vomiting. Black signifies a critical condition of the internal organs. A blue area on the glabella (the space between the eyebrows) denotes initial fright-induced diarrhea; red indicates severe fright with night crying, while black suggests an obstructive issue. Blue at the root of the nose signifies a second bout of fright; increased agitation after diarrhea indicates serious condition; significant black and yellow may lead to death. A flat lifespan line suggests potential early death; blue signifies heat-induced fright, black indicates a fatal outcome, red suggests restlessness leading to death, subtle yellow indicates stability, while prominent yellow signifies cholera. </p>
<p>A blue tint at the承浆 (the area below the lower lip) signifies fright during feeding; yellow indicates vomiting and also points to blood in stools; black indicates wind-induced fright. Yellow in the whites of the eyes signifies heat; yellow in the blue of the eyes denotes food stagnation and intestinal worms; blue in the whites indicates fright-induced convulsions; yellow in the blue of the eyes signifies typhus. </p>
<p>A blue mark above the eyebrows is auspicious; sudden red indicates restlessness and night crying, while yellow may suggest cholera, and prolonged redness may be fatal. </p>
<p>Wind conditions may appear in the two pools (areas near the eyes); blue indicates a wind condition, purple may signal vomiting or fever, yellow indicates vomiting, and red indicates restlessness and night crying. </p>
<p>Red cheeks denote possible lung heat. Blue at the temples suggests a second incidence of fright; if the blue spreads from the temples to the ears, it may result in death; red indicates blood in urine. </p>
<p>Blue on both sides of the face points to an obstructive issue, yellow denotes phlegm overflow, and red signifies wind heat. </p>
<p>Both red cheeks suggest typhus, while blue at the mandibles indicates potential worm infestation.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

<p>Pulse Forms</p>
<p>The &quot;flowing pearl&quot; shape indicates injury from food, internal heat wanting to vomit, or gurgling intestines with diarrhea, irritability, and crying. Use gastric paste to mitigate food effects, separating yin and yang; if digestion occurs but illness persists, use fragrant sand to help gastric paste to tonify the spleen and stomach. The &quot;ringed pearl&quot; shape indicates spleen deficiency with food stagnation, fullness and congestion in the chest, and thirst with fever. Use the modified Five Flavors Essence Powder with mountain pear and bitter orange to strengthen the spleen and aid digestion, followed by Six Gentlemen Decoction to nourish the central qi. The &quot;long pearl&quot; shape indicates spleen injury, food accumulation, abdominal pain, intolerance of cold and heat, and inability to eat. First, use Great Tranquility Pills to resolve accumulation, followed by Essence Powder to strengthen spleen qi. The &quot;coming snake&quot; shape indicates damp-heat in the spleen and stomach, blockage in the middle section, dry retching, and inability to eat. This is an internal evil of malnutrition; first, use the Four Flavor Fat Child Pills to treat malnutrition, followed by Four Gentlemen Decoction to tonify the spleen. The &quot;going snake&quot; shape indicates spleen deficiency with food accumulation, vomiting, diarrhea, thirst, shortness of breath, anxiety, inability to eat, and fatigue.

If the external pathogen is resolved but anxiety and cold fingers persist, it indicates spleen qi injury; in this case, use Qiwwei Baizhu Powder for supplementation. If there are severe issues like breathlessness and difficulty breathing, it may be difficult to treat due to significant spleen deficiency.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Through the analysis of the condition, the primary concern is the wind attacking the liver, which can overpower the spleen&#39;s earth. In urgent cases, use Six Gentlemen, Mu Xiang, Diaoteng Gou, and Guang Gui to warm and tonify the spleen. If there is no response, add Fu Zi to revive the Yang Qi, which often helps those who are seriously ill.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve heard ancient people say: children are like young sprouts, soft like grass shoots or water&#39;s soak. This is because their organs are fragile, and they cannot express themselves, making medication difficult to administer. One should first observe the complexion to understand the condition, and then check the tiger&#39;s mouth to discern its cause—this is a concise approach to treatment.</p>
<p>Note: The flowing beads show just a point of red; the ring beads differ in size, and the long beads are oval and elongated. The above does not refer to loops, but rather to the red veins penetrating the Qi. Coming snake is like long bead scatter, with one end thick and the other sharp. The departing snake is the same. The distinction of upper and lower aspects leads to their naming. The horn bow bent outward shows repression, while inward indicates smoothness. The spear shape points straight up, the fishbone diverges, and the water character symbolizes the simultaneous flow of three pulses. The needle shape indicates a pass with a few grains of rice, with the penetrating meridian directed outward while the life meridian curves in. However, I have also treated conditions without exclusively focusing on their shapes and pulses—there are cases where specific treatments with particular medications have yielded good results.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The presence of fishbone causing wind syndrome should not be doubted; it is accompanied by qi-related illness and heat. When the life gate shows this, it is difficult to treat, as it indicates a transition from the liver to the spleen. </p>
<p>Initially, the suspended needle can lead to dysentery; the qi gate shows lung heat further aggravating the illness. When the three gates are directly linked to the underworld, it is important to recognize this as a chronic fright. </p>
<p>Water-related fright indicates the lungs have received wind; the qi gate experiences wheezing and cough with accumulated phlegm. Physicians should carefully analyze the deficiencies and excesses; the onset of fright viewed alongside this illness is ominous. </p>
<p>The character &#39;乙&#39; represents fright affecting the liver and lungs; the qi gate manifests with sudden emergencies. If this form appears directly at the life gate, it won&#39;t take long to develop into a chronic spleen issue. </p>
<p>The curled worm indicates the onset of illness; if the qi gate shows stagnant toxins in the liver. Once it reaches the life gate, it is untreatable, and one must know that the heart has transmitted to the liver. </p>
<p>When double rings indicate deep liver illness, vomiting and nausea arise from the gastric qi gate. If the life gate shows signs of imminent death, it’s futile for physicians to exhaust their efforts. </p>
<p>When flowing pearls are seen, death approaches; even if the face looks like this, the person will not survive. Though there may be miraculous pills, no one can save them. Physicians must still be meticulous and attentive. </p>
<p>In cases of typhoid, the inclination is to the right; for food injury, seven should be cautious. If there&#39;s cold injury, it is determined; when startled, mountain-shaped signs appear.

<p>The form resembles a crescent moon, feeling left within qi and heat distress. If it bends to the left, wind and heat medicines can be used. Forms like three folds indicate an enmity with solid objects. Additional rings forming the legs especially distrust the upper and lower hooks. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis Verse</strong></p>
<p>When a child is ill, rely on the pulse; one finger on three positions determines the breath. Slow and cold, or fast and hot, passed down through the ages. Floating, windy, sinking, and stagnant, recognize these first. The left hand at the &quot;Renying&quot; indicates external symptoms, while the right at &quot;Qikou&quot; points to internal diseases. Observe for invasion of wind, cold, heat, and dampness from the outside; from the inside, consider milk, food, phlegm, and accumulation. A large and tight pulse indicates harm from cold; a floating and soft pulse with sweat suggests a cold wind. A floating and full pulse often indicates excess of wind-heat, while a sinking and thin pulse is due to accumulation of milk and food. A tight and sinking pulse with persistent abdominal pain; a wiry and tight pulse indicates breathlessness in the throat. A tight pulse can give rise to rashes and boils, while a rapid pulse may lead to convulsions. A soft and thin pulse suggests parasites, while a firm and solid pulse indicates constipation. A flooding pulse shows blood in the stool, and a weak, moist pulse accompanies anxiety. A slippery pulse indicates injury from exposure to dampness and cold. A tense and rapid pulse must be noted for its adverse effects. Discrepancies in size indicate critical conditions; two beats indicate collapse, three indicate sudden fatality. Five signifies deficiency, four indicates harm, while six, balanced and harmonious, implies no illness. Seven and eight reflect milder conditions, nine and ten indicate severity. Eleven and twelve pulses confirm inevitable death; this principle is rarely wrong.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

<p>Children&#39;s index fingers differentiate three positions, with boys on the left and girls on the right. All know the initial wind and climate; the end is the fate gate, easy yet difficult. To understand the pulse patterns at the tiger&#39;s mouth, observe the lines from an inverted position, divided into five colors. Yellow and red signify harmony of the five organs; red and purple indicate gains and losses. Purple and blue suggest damage from excessive eating and weariness, while black patterns point to reverse conditions. Suddenly, pure black appears amidst, making skilled doctors&#39; hearts tremble. If it rises straight to the wind gate, the lengths of rice grains split at both ends. Like a gunshot startled by the wind, the fingers form various splits. A reversed bow indicates outward conditions, while intermingling of forward and reverse signifies difficult illnesses. The length of the splits can be treated; thus, doctors must observe carefully. A boy of two years is still considered an infant, while two to four years old is the young one&#39;s name. By five or six, youth grows gradually; at seven and eight, feelings begin to be discerned.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a child is nine-tenths in age and exhibits illness, one must discern the cause of the condition. At eleven, epilepsy is known as &quot;falling wind,&quot; while malnutrition resembles the afflictions of fatigue. A heaviness or stagnation is often identified, with a distinct feeling of heat or variations in temperature. Initially, a warm palm indicates the body&#39;s heat condition. If the belly feels warm while the body is cold, this suggests an accumulation of issues. Warm feet and a hot forehead imply a wind invasion, while a cool forehead and warm feet indicate fright. Rash and sores may erupt with redness behind the ears. For children with accumulated issues, emesis is advisable, especially in cases of three types of febrile illness. During food-related diarrhea, it is essential to manage accumulations, and for cold diarrhea, warming the spleen is necessary. For watery diarrhea, focus on draining excess from the organs. If a child suddenly cries out without reason, it may not be due to wind but rather a celestial disturbance. A loud cry with rapid breathing and a rough voice may indicate the ingestion of hot toxic substances causing distress. Immediate vomiting and harmonizing the spleen is crucial; administering fright-relieving medicines could be humorous under the circumstances.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Theory of Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>Children are in the early stage of life. The newborn is called an infant, a three-year-old is called a child, and a ten-year-old is called a youth. There are different sizes among children, and the severity of diseases varies among them. By observing their shape, color, voice, and pulse, if one can investigate these details carefully, they could be regarded as a skilled and wise practitioner.</p>
<p>To observe is to discern appearance and color. For example, the left cheek corresponds to the liver, the right cheek to the lungs, the forehead to the heart, the nose to the spleen, and the chin to the kidneys. If there is liver disease, the face turns green; if lung disease, the face turns pale; if heart disease, the face turns red; if spleen disease, the face turns yellow; and if kidney disease, the face turns dark. This is knowledge derived from observation.</p>
<p>To hear is to understand the condition through sound. For instance, with liver disease, the voice is mournful; with lung disease, the voice is hurried; with heart disease, the voice is strong; with spleen disease, the voice is slow; and with kidney disease, the voice is deep. These pertain to the organs. Additionally, if there is disease in the large intestine, the voice is prolonged; in the small intestine, the voice is short; in the stomach, the voice is quick; in the gallbladder, the voice is clear; and in the bladder, the voice is faint. This is knowledge derived from hearing.</p>
<p>To inquire is to ask about the disease’s origins. For example, if a person craves sour food, they may have liver disease; if they crave spicy food, they may have lung disease; if they crave bitter food, they may have heart disease; if they crave sweet food, they may have spleen disease; if they crave salty food, they may have kidney disease; if they prefer hot food, they may have internal cold; and if they prefer cold food, they may have internal heat. This is knowledge derived from inquiry.</p>
<p>To palpate is to feel the pulse and detect the disease.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a three-year-old child is unwell, first examine the left hand for boys and the right hand for girls at the tiger mouth&#39;s three points. From the side of the second finger, the first joint is called &quot;Wind Point,&quot; the second joint is called &quot;Qi Point,&quot; and the third joint is called &quot;Life Point.&quot; By distinguishing their colors and patterns: purple indicates heat, red signifies injury from cold, blue represents wind disturbance, white points to malnutrition, black denotes poison, and yellow reflects spleen distress. If observed at the Wind Point, the condition is mild; if at the Qi Point, it is severe; if exceeding the Life Point, it is difficult to treat. </p>
<p>For children over three years old, use one finger to press the inch, guan, and chi parts. Typically, six to seven beats are the standard; an increase suggests heat, a decrease implies cold, a floating pulse indicates excessive wind, a rapid pulse indicates frequent surprises, a deep and slow pulse implies deficiency, while a deep and firm pulse indicates accumulation. This is how one discerns through pulse diagnosis.</p>
<p>Generally, most illnesses in children arise from intrauterine toxins, with few resulting from dietary harm. External symptoms of wind and cold are usually limited. When a child is still in the womb, if the mother is hungry, the child feels it; if the mother is full, the child feels it too. Spicy or strong flavors can increase the fetal energy; emotional disturbances of the mother can agitate the child. Overeating fried or harsh foods, indulgence in overly spicy or acidic tastes, emotional volatility, or uncontrolled desires can all lead to problems for the child.</p>
<p>As for the mother, if she cannot exercise caution during pregnancy and fails to care properly after childbirth, she may only seek quick relief, neglecting prevention. This may lead to introducing overly salty or sour tastes before the child is even a hundred days old, or sweet and fatty foods before the child is one year old, resulting in various diseases. A child&#39;s spleen and stomach are inherently delicate and easily harmed by accumulation.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Variations in Fetal Qi Reception</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Golds&quot; states: A child receives the essence and qi from the mother during gestation. In the first month, the embryo forms; in the second month, the fetus develops; in the third month, blood vessels are established; in the fourth month, the shape takes form; in the fifth month, movement begins; in the sixth month, muscles and bones develop; in the seventh month, hair begins to grow; in the eighth month, internal organs are complete; in the ninth month, the spirit enters the stomach; and in the tenth month, a hundred spirits are ready, leading to birth. </p>
<p>Within sixty days after birth, the pupils form, allowing for smiling and recognition; by a hundred days, the meridians are complete, leading to the ability to turn and roll; at one hundred eighty days, the tailbone develops, enabling independent sitting; at two hundred ten days, the bones of the palm develop, allowing for crawling; at three hundred days, the kneecap forms, enabling standing; and at three hundred sixty days marks a full term, with the knee bones complete, allowing for walking. </p>
<p>This is the norm. If it is not so, the body will not attain balance. There may be cases where a child cannot walk or stand by the ages of four or five, which indicates an insufficiency in the reception of fetal qi. If the muscles are strong, there will be greater strength; if the bones are solid, walking will occur earlier; if the blood is abundant, the body will be slender and have more hair; if the flesh is sufficient, there will be fewer illnesses. If the essence is adequate, the child will be lively, talkative, and resilient to cold and heat; if the qi is abundant, there will be less hair but a robust body. These indicate a sufficient reception of fetal qi. </p>
<p>In general, the endowment should be moderate, with pure yin and yang, a balance of hardness and softness, harmony between qi and blood, complete spirit, and a strong physique. Before being fully developed, the skull should be well-formed and firm, the eyes bright and clear, the mouth rectangular with thick lips, bones sturdy and buttocks full, the navel deep and abdomen soft, the penis small and testes large, the teeth fine and hair glossy, the voice loud and sleep stable; these all reflect a balanced and harmonious reception of fetal qi. Thus, by listening to the voice and observing the form, one can discern health, vitality, and longevity.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

<p>Human beings are endowed with the dual energies of yin and yang, which can manifest diseases in the three burners. However, adults are generally easier to treat, while young children are more difficult. The Yellow Emperor stated: &quot;I cannot discern the conditions of the very young, for that involves a separate method of regulation.&quot; This does not fall under the discussions in the Yellow Emperor&#39;s Classic.</p>
<p>He also mentioned: &quot;Children are like waves on water or dew on grass; when using medication, one must not act hastily.&quot; Indeed, children&#39;s organs are fragile, their blood and energy are insufficient, their bodies are not firm, and their spirit is not well-prepared, which is why they are said to be difficult to treat.</p>
<p>An infant is called a newborn, a child up to three years old is referred to as a young child, and those up to ten years old are called boys. The sizes and conditions vary greatly, so one must not apply the same treatment indiscriminately. It is essential to understand the nature of the condition, assess life and death, examine the depth of illness, and know the nature of the medicine, whether it is cold or warm.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Observation of Form and Qi</strong></p>
<p>Form refers to the face’s appearance. Qi refers to the spirit and energy. Indeed, one aspect of understanding children&#39;s conditions lies in the correspondence between internal and external signs. Can one only perceive the condition through observing form like one plays the qin? This is true. Moreover, the vitality of a child does not solely depend on their fatness or thinness, but rather on their complexion and energy. How so? There are those who are plump yet weak in Qi, and those who are thin yet robust in Qi. When Qi is weak, the complexion must be pale, indicating deficiency; when Qi is strong, the complexion must be vibrant, indicating fullness. The energies of the five viscera manifest on the face: the liver shows as green, the heart as red, the lungs as white, the kidneys as black, and the spleen as yellow, representing the five colors. The liver thrives in spring, the heart in summer, the lungs in autumn, and the kidneys in winter, each for seventy-two days; the spleen flourishes eighteen days after each season, representing its fundamental position. However, there are times in the spring and winter when the face turns greenish-black, which is not related to the liver or kidneys. In times not autumn or summer, when the face turns reddish-white, this is not attributed to the heart or lungs. The colors of the Qi from the five viscera layer upon each other, manifesting and flowing based on the condition, with no fixed pattern.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Suddenly, black corresponds to pain, suddenly red corresponds to heat, suddenly white corresponds to cold, and suddenly yellow corresponds to accumulation; this opening and closing of qi is not bound by time or location. Additionally, just as the heart governs the forehead, the liver governs the eyes and the left side of the face, the spleen governs the upper and lower lips, the lung governs the right side of the face, and the kidney governs the area in front of and below the ears—these forms may be seen in their positions or revealed in other areas. This is known as the ungraspable aspect; this is the selection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the spleen governs the lips for purposes of expulsion and diarrhea, if there is lingering illness associated with this and the color appears black, then the kidney is overpowering the spleen, where water counteracts earth, referred to as strong dominance, which may lead to failure of that organ. The liver governs the eyes and the left side of the face, its color being blue, which is its true color; it relates to shock and fright, indicating a favorable condition. However, if white is seen, it indicates the lung is overcoming the liver, which signifies an unfavorable condition. By examining these observations and connecting them, the outcome depends on the individual.</p>
<p>Infants observe the five colors of the face to determine the source of illness, and also check whether the eyes are spirited or lack spirit, where spirit refers to the brightness and radiance in the eyes. The latent and manifest, the horizontal and intense manifestations, should correspond to the locations and the five organs and colors, namely: blue (liver), red (heart), yellow (spleen), white (lung), and black (kidney). All five organs correspond to illnesses confined within, which must show in external form and color. When an infant is ill, one should first observe the shapes and colors in the main body, discuss the interactions of the five elements and assess fortune or misfortune; if the shapes and colors correspond, then one may listen to sounds and take the pulse.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

<p>Childhood ailments may appear daunting, but if the pulse is strong at Tai Chong and the spirit is not exhausted, and the fontanel is not sunken, if the coloration at the three positions does not show dark spots, then hope is within reach. Nevertheless, the essence of the five organs and six bowels rises to the eyes; by observing this, one can ascertain the condition, but first, one must verify by the full spirit in the eyes. If there is spirit in the eyes, survival is assured; if the eyes lack spirit, death is certain.</p>
<h3>Sources of Illness</h3>
<p>After great joy, if one consumes milk and food, it may lead to seizures. Joy pertains to the heart; excessive joy from food harms the heart. According to Qian, the heart governs shock, and shock leads to seizures. &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: Violent anger injures Yin, and excessive joy injures Yang. Sun Zhenren says: injuring Yin leads to diarrhea, injuring Yang leads to shock. Tong Zhenzi notes: Drinking water after great joy harms the San Jiao and can often lead to wheezing. </p>
<p>Crying excessively after consuming milk and food frequently results in vomiting and diarrhea. According to Qian, crying relates to the lungs; excessive crying after food injures the lungs, and if lung Qi is reversed, it leads to vomiting and diarrhea. The lungs and large intestine are interrelated, thus resulting in diarrhea.</p>
<p>After extreme hunger, consuming milk and food may often cause abdominal pain. &quot;Qian Jin&quot; states: Hungry people eating hastily may often develop abdominal pain. &quot;Xiu Zhen Mi&quot; notes: Overeating when hungry causes accumulation and distention. It also states: Do not eat hastily; hasty consumption injures the spleen. Bian Que states: Eating too hastily over time leads to blockages and pallor.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; states: Excessive drinking causes the lungs to spread and become unbalanced, leading to the upward flow of Qi and the production of phlegm diseases. The &quot;Immortal Classic&quot; says: After a full meal, if exposed to the wind, one may suffer from sudden convulsions and lose consciousness, resembling a stroke. After a great fright, consuming milk or food can cause vomiting and heart pain. Following a fright while consuming milk or food leads to the invasion of the small Yin channels, often resulting in heart pain. The &quot;Hold to Simplicity&quot; explains: A fright combined with milk, food, or drinking water causes Qi stagnation, which could result in various vomiting and stomach disturbances. The texts say: Drinking water after a fright harms the heart, causing the tongue to become unable to speak. </p>
<p>When infants drink milk in the wind, it can lead to coughing and abdominal bloating. The sage Zang said: When infants drink milk in the wind, the cold wind enters the lungs, causing coughing. The &quot;Treasure Mirror&quot; states: Cold wind injures breastfeeding, leading to infants experiencing vomiting and a cold, bloated abdomen. Another text states: Cold bodily conditions and cold drinks harm the lungs, which leads to coughing. The lungs govern Qi; if Qi is harmed, it results in abdominal bloating. </p>
<p>Exposure to night dew while breastfeeding infants often leads to vomiting. The &quot;True Cultivation Manual&quot; states: Night dew affects breastfeeding infants, as cold milk entering the throat does not disperse and often results in vomiting and reflux.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a></p></div>

If she eats properly before nursing, it results in the child developing a yellow, malodorous mouth. Wang&#39;s commentary notes that proper meals before nursing cause the child’s mouth to stink and lead to bleeding from the gums. Tongzhenzi mentions that both milk and food cause the child’s face to turn yellow and mouth to smell bad, and can also produce phlegm and cysts.</p>
<p>If a mother sweats before nursing, it leads to heart damp and strong heat. Ge Hong explains that sweat is the liquid of the heart; if there is excessive sweating before nursing, it injures the heart. When the heart is damaged, the fluids disperse, causing the skin to dry out and resulting in heart damp and strong heat.</p>
<p>Feeding milk to children after consuming hot foods often leads to a condition known as &#39;turtle chest.&#39; Sun Zhao observes that if a mother eats strong-flavored foods, it results in the child developing turtle chest. Xu’s commentary states that if hot foods are consumed before nursing, over time, the child will definitely develop turtle chest.</p>
<p>If a mother consumes sour and salty grilled food before nursing her child, it leads to thirst. The &quot;Shenghui Fang&quot; states that if the nursing mother indulges in strong-flavored grilled foods and rich flavors, it causes heat in the child&#39;s internal organs, leading to restlessness and incessant thirst.

Baopuzi states: When the wet nurse drinks excessively and cools herself in the wind, the cold air and the wine poison mix with the milk and enter the infant&#39;s throat, causing the child to lose its voice and remain silent.</p>
<p>Coughing after nursing leads to choking on phlegm. After a cough, if the infant drinks milk, the phlegm gathers and does not disperse, causing the airways to be obstructed and preventing the diaphragm from functioning, leading to choking on phlegm and sudden wheezing.</p>
<p>If sorrow and joy are unsettled and nursing occurs, it results in drooling and coughing. Mengzi states: If sorrow and joy are uncertain when nursing, the child will surely drool, cough, and draw in wind. The Baojian states: If sorrow and joy are unsettled, drinking water will cause the qi to reverse, the qi will overpower the blood, and if the blood vessels are obstructed, it often results in spitting blood.</p>
<p>If the infant cries and nursing occurs before the cry settles, it leads to the formation of goiter. In general, if the infant&#39;s crying has not settled and is immediately silenced with milk, the qi cannot dissipate and thus accumulates into a goiter. Mengzi states: If the infant cries and the lung passages are open, and it is nursed immediately, it goes against the qi, causing the qi to condense and accumulate, often resulting in lumpy goiters and tumors.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Song of No Suffering</h3>
<p>The child’s appearance and demeanor are notably different. The nose is dry with no mucus, the throat is silent with no drool. The head is like dye of azure, the lips are like freshly painted vermilion. The face is square, reflecting flowers and bamboo, the cheeks burst with water lilies. He happily invites a smile, though he does not express himself openly at the right time. Even if he cries, it is not for long; even if he sleeps, it is not for too long. His disposition is like still waves, his nature like a sky mirrored in a still lake. This child has much peace and goodness; what is there to worry about in being plagued by illness?</p>
<h3>Diagnosing Illness by Sound</h3>
<p>The &quot;Records of Music&quot; states: all sounds arise from the human heart. The movements of the heart are influenced by external things. When affected by objects, the heart moves, hence it manifests in sound. Sounds respond to one another, thus generating changes. Human sickness is hidden within, but the voice reveals it externally. When music is chaotic, the five tones are disharmonious; when the human voice is chaotic, the five organs are disharmonious. Therefore, listening to sounds is a way to diagnose people&#39;s illnesses. The &quot;Plain Questions&quot; says: by observing breathing and listening to sounds, one knows the source of suffering. Thus, the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; states: use the five energies, five colors, and five sounds to observe life and death. The sage Sun said: when the five organs are disharmonious, the five sounds are out of tune, the five colors are uncertain, there certainly will be illness. The &quot;Three Causes Method&quot; says: observe the excess or deficiency of the five organs; the throat pertains to sounds, it maintains balance. When balanced, the energy is strong; when deficient, the energy is weak. Therefore, the voice is like coming from a room, indicating the sparseness of energy. If words are few, and only said once every day, it can deplete energy. Words, whether good or bad, do not avoid kinship or distance, thus disturbing the spirit and clarity. When the sounds do not follow one another in intent, yin and yang are lost. Therefore, it is said: those who maintain balance are alive, while those who lose it are dead.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Conditions of Various Illnesses</p>
<p>When a child cries with a deep voice and doesn’t respond, it indicates a serious illness, making it difficult for physicians to treat. A lighter, more floating voice indicates a milder condition that can be easily addressed. A dry and sunken forehead, tense tendons, red lips on the outside but pale on the inside, sores without moisture, and severe cases accompanied by agitation suggest extreme heat. Red eyes indicate an accumulation of heat in the liver, and light sensitivity may imply liver disturbance. Tooth decay and disrupted digestion from milk suggest toxicity, while indigestion signifies cold accumulation in the spleen. Hearing loss points to kidney deficiency, while infantile eczema suggests wind accumulation in the lungs. Fluctuating body temperature may be caused by shock, while emotional expressions like sorrow or singing indicate an invasion of evil energies into the spleen. Mouth ulcers and abdominal bloating from stagnant accumulation, gas reversal leading to vomiting, and malarial fever point to spleen damage. Sleeping with the mouth open signals excess toxicity in the five organs, while excessive crying indicates shock moving into the lungs. A craving for soil suggests intestinal parasites in the spleen, and night sweats indicate blood deficiency with heat. Palms feeling hot suggest malnutrition and fatigue, while ear ringing indicates obstruction by heat in the kidney channel, and bloating with nausea points to spleen and stomach accumulation. A craving for charcoal suggests liver parasitism, while consuming tea leaves indicates heart involvement, and eating raw rice indicates issues with the spleen. Analyzing using logic and measuring by intention reflects the comprehensive wisdom of a physician.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></p></div>

<p>Sudden fright leads to wide-open eyes, while chronic fright causes eyes to close. Crying without tears indicates agitation, while tears without crying signify restlessness. A protruding tongue signifies wind, and closed eyes that resemble sleep without craving food signify emptiness. Abdominal pain that feels full points to qi stagnation, while turning over and lying down indicates spleen illness. Changing hands to wave and crying upon hearing words signifies a solid condition. Clear nasal discharge indicates cold in the lung channel. Shaking the head with a stiff neck suggests heat in the triple warmer. Fish-like eyes fixed wide signal night death; a pale face with black lips signifies death during the day.</p>
<h3>Song of Untreated Mixed Diseases</h3>
<p>Vomiting and diarrhea lead to wind, with a membrane over the eyes, and wind is felt but not grasped. Sudden fright leads to unending panting; chronic fright causes thin skin. Intestinal issues lead to loneliness in the heart, with cough, vomiting, and reversed heartache. In severe cold, red veins crossing indicate blackened faces and hair loss. Smallpox entering the eyes results in inability to open them; heat spilling out leads to dry mouth and aversion. A locked jaw, low waist, and blackened lips indicate severe dysentery and spleen toxicity, with rolled-up lips. These diseases arise from fright without accumulation; how could immortals leave behind miraculous medicine?</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of Luo Qianfu, a young boy in May, after eating cold starch, experienced abdominal pain. He then purchased Shenqiong pills from a pharmacy, which caused his belly and abdomen to grow increasingly cold and painful, with the pain coming and going for over seven or eight years without relief. He remembered the ancient saying: &quot;To treat cold, one must use heat.&quot; To cure cold with heat is a principle that even skilled doctors should not abandon. The substance that harmed him was cold; the medicine he took was also cold. A heavy cold injures the stomach, which explains the cold disease he suffered from. Generally, a person&#39;s spleen and stomach prefer warmth and dislike cold. Moreover, a child&#39;s blood and qi are still weak, making him unable to withstand such cold. Hence, the Yang energy becomes concealed, and the cold poison lingers, remaining for a long time without removal. To treat an illness, one must first address its root cause; thus, one should use harmonizing and qi-nurturing medicine to remedy past mistakes. After taking the right medicine for a month, he finally healed. Alas! When Kongzi received medicine, he said he would not dare taste it until he understood it; this is crucial for preserving life. How could one simply remain silent and insist on feeling the pulse, believing they could identify the illness? The pulse reflects a person&#39;s blood and qi, flowing between the meridians: when heat prevails, the pulse is rapid; when cold prevails, the pulse is slow; when real, it is strong; when empty, it is weak. How could one distinguish what injured him merely by its shape? Physicians must carefully examine the source of the illness. Additionally, the father of this boy did not inform the doctor of the source of the illness but sought remedies in the marketplace, resulting in seven years of suffering, all because he overlooked this principle. Master Sun said: &quot;Before diagnosing, it is best to inquire first,&quot; which is very accurate. Dongpo said: &quot;If one only seeks to cure the illness, without considering the physician&#39;s burden.&quot; The words of these two sages greatly benefit the world.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The way of medicine is indeed difficult. Therefore, treating children is particularly challenging. The revered Sun said: &quot;To be able to treat ten men is not as good as treating one woman.&quot; Why is that? Men are robust and vigorous, while women&#39;s blood and veins are complicated, especially with childbirth making treatment more difficult. The &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; states: &quot;Women&#39;s illnesses are ten times more difficult to treat than men&#39;s.&quot; It also says: &quot;To be able to treat ten women is not as good as treating one child.&quot; Why is that? Women can discuss their illnesses, their blood andqi are still intact; children cannot express themselves, their spirits are not fully developed, and pulse-taking is hard to rely on; thus, they are said to be difficult to treat.</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was said that understanding from observing was called &quot;spiritual insight,&quot; and pediatricians are known as the &quot;dumb doctors.&quot; When examining, it is particularly important to observe color, so it is addressed first. When observing an infant&#39;s face, one must discern five colors to understand the source of illness. The human body has five parts, with the head being the foremost; within the head is the face, and within the face are the eyes, where illumination is found. The &quot;spirit&quot; refers to the brightness of the eyes, which can be seen through their clarity and reaction, corresponding to the five internal organs. The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. The colors of the five organs are as follows: the heart is red, the liver is blue, the spleen is yellow, the lungs are white, and the kidneys are black. The illnesses corresponding to the five organs are contained within and must manifest in outward appearance. Therefore, when a child is ill, one should first observe the color and shape of the main body to discuss the influences of the five elements regarding fortune and misfortune. If the color and shape do not correspond, then one should listen to sounds and take the pulse.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a></p></div>

The liver governs the eyes, particularly the pupils. The spirit of the internal organs is contained within, while externally it relates to the five aspects. The eye sockets belong to the spleen, and heat produces phlegm. Both canthi are associated with the heart; when there is heat, it causes pain like needles. White belongs to the lungs; heat generates stones. Yellow relates to the liver; it causes cloudiness and impairment of vision. The central pupil is linked to heat in the kidneys, causing unclear vision. Eyes suddenly blink and dart, indicating wind and fright.</p>
<p>The heart governs: the cheekbones and facial cheeks belong to the heart position. Black denotes heaviness and despair; blue indicates fright and palpitations. Red certainly indicates wind; white points to consumption and gas. If there is a deficiency of yellow energy, it can lead to swelling and counterflow of qi; why has the heart suddenly given out? A loud cry several times. If one passes through without a sound, it must result in a crow’s call. Adding heat leads to shock and surprises, dispersing heat to clear the heart.</p>
<p>The spleen governs: the lips and mouth reveal illnesses, with the philtrum receiving fluid. Surrounding top and bottom are collectively known as the spleen territory. The mouth opening relates to the heart, as heart and spleen can have heat. Cracked lips and tongue sores indicate accumulated heat in the three burners. Lips red like blood indicate deep thirst. Candidiasis and thick tongue occur with heat in the spleen and lungs, causing foul breath. Cold qi within the spleen and kidneys turns the complexion to a lifeless liver color. A sudden fright can lead to dry mouth and pale lips. Frequent accumulation of fear must eventually affect the heart. Insufficient heart qi causes children to be restless and cry.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Without the divine light in the eyes, it is indeed difficult to use medicine. The five forms of symptoms at the mouth indicate more severe wind, serving as evidence of untreatable conditions. </p>
<p>The lungs govern: the two nostrils and the bridge of the nose, together with the inner and outer canthi, are where the lungs reside. If the nostrils appear dark and sooty, it indicates a severe condition of the lung channels. This soot is as dark as ink, signaling a dire state of the lungs. If there&#39;s redness and itching within the nose, it suggests a condition of excessive heat and parasites. If there is a flow of white mucus, it indicates cold in the brain causing lethargy. A flow of greenish mucus suggests a cold caused by wind, which makes one prone to sleep. Lung heat leads to nasal obstruction caused by breathing. If one feels the nose is ulcerated, it indicates a state of depletion. A foul odor signifies accumulated heat.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern: the area before the ear, called the ear flower. The ear&#39;s edge is known as the rim, and the space within is referred to as the curve. If the rim appears blackened, it indicates weakness and heat in the kidneys. If it is as dark as charcoal, it suggests a critical state of the kidneys. If there are sores at the ear gate, it indicates significant accumulation. If pus flows from the ear, it indicates extreme heat and depletion of the kidneys. Foul odor leads to ear ringing, with continual discharge. If sores itch as if cracking, it is a sign of internal heat. Suddenly losing hearing indicates stifled heart and kidney energy. There is often a rumbling sound, as heat rises. It may feel as if insects are crawling, signaling both depletion and heat from defenses. If the ear rim feels icy, further examination should reveal red veins; this may indicate an invasion of variola. A red and hot ear rim suggests a febrile condition. Extreme internal pain hinges on swelling and pressure. To clear the heart and cool the diaphragm, one must unblock channels and openings. </p>
<p>When it comes to children and their kidneys, they often remain weak without significant illness. One must not apply aggressive treatments, as supplementation would be of little use.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Introduction</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Li Chan]</p>
<p><strong>Observation of Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Observe the child&#39;s complexion: the liver is represented by a blue hue, the heart by red, the spleen by yellow, the lungs by white, and the kidneys by black. If the face lacks yellow, it is untreatable. Spring is associated with a white complexion, summer with black, autumn with red, and winter with yellow—these are signs of imbalance.</p>
<p>First, differentiate the regions. The left cheek corresponds to the Azure Dragon linked to the liver, indicating excess in spring. The right cheek corresponds to the White Tiger linked to the lungs, indicating deficiency in autumn. </p>
<p>The forehead is prominent and connected to the fire of the heart; it should display summer colors: red signifies extreme heat, while blue indicates liver wind. A blue tint at the Yintang (third eye) suggests fear; red and white indicate disturbance from water and fire, and red indicates phlegm heat. If the Yintang connects to the tip of the nose with redness, it signifies accumulated heat in the Sanjiao (Triple Burner); if redness extends from the Yintang to the root of the nose, it indicates heat in the heart and small intestine, with possible issues in urination. Red from the root of the nose to the nasal column points to heat in the heart and stomach, leading to urinary difficulties. The lower face signifies the passive Yin of the kidneys and water.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The chin corresponds to the winter color, indicating a deficiency of the kidneys. The color of the承浆 (Chengjiang) is blue; when eating, there may be shock, or restlessness leading to night crying. If there is excessive yellow, it indicates vomiting, while red signifies illness in the kidney qi. Redness at the corners of the jaw indicates lung heat. </p>
<p>The nose, located in the center of the face, corresponds to the four seasons; if the tip is red or yellow, there&#39;s no issue. The spleen relates to the lips. Red lips signify thirst. If the heart is bitten by roundworms, the lips will turn inward. The area between the nose and chin corresponds to the small intestine; it prefers a deep, long shape and dislikes being flat and full. A black color indicates diarrhea or dysentery leading to death. Generally, if the Five Peaks are red, it indicates heat; if pale white, it suggests deficiency.</p>
<p>The poem by Chen on the accumulation of cold and heat in the five organs states: &quot;Liver shock rises at the hairline, liver accumulation in the food storage. Liver cold shows blue-white lips, liver heat is at the eyebrows. Heart shock is at the glabella, heart accumulation is at the corners of the forehead. Heart cold appears at the solar region, heart heat shows on both cheeks. Spleen shock is at the hairline, spleen accumulation has yellow lips. Spleen cold is at the center of the eyebrows, spleen heat occurs at the solar point. Lung shock is at the hairline, lung accumulation matches the hairline. Lung cold is visible at the philtrum, lung heat appears at both jaws. Kidney shock is at the front of the ears, kidney accumulation shows in the eyelids. Kidney cold presents as purple at the forehead, kidney heat appears red in the food storage.&quot;</p>
<p>Red qi seen indicates excessive heat phlegm. The glabella belongs to the heart: red indicates heat phlegm, blue-black indicates shocked phlegm, while yellow and blue indicate wind phlegm. Blue color reveals shocked wind and palpitations. Black like coal can signify pain and adverse reactions; like orange, it indicates food damage, spleen deficiency, and vomiting or diarrhea.</p>
<p>The Right Taiyin (Lung) at the Wenwu platform is also marked in blue for food damage, yet can also indicate heat and spleen deficiency with vomiting or diarrhea. White signifies wasting; it represents cold, with lung qi being unbeneficial.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a></p></div>

She loves warmth when sitting or lying down, and feels the chill of the wind; she feels cold when stretching or curling up, tormented by heat and restlessness. She has a large belly and small feet, her spleen desires to rest yet becomes ill; her eyes are wide and mouth agape, she appears in danger and is bound to perish. Alas! Of the five limbs, the head is supreme, only the spirit can be relied upon. </p>
<p>As for the illnesses of children, if one sees the eyes lacking brightness, the black pupils without movement, the eyelashes lacking luster, like a cat or fish’s eyes, or if both eyes are closed and the pupils dim, death may follow. If they appear dazed outwardly yet the spirit remains hidden within, life may continue. Children whose eyes are bright with black orbs are less likely to fall ill, while those with more white or yellowish pupils, or small ones, are weak and more prone to sickness. Red eyes indicate heat in the heart, pale red signifies weakness and heat in the heart, green indicates heat in the liver, light colors show liver deficiency, yellow suggests heat in the spleen, while lack of brightness denotes kidney deficiency, and cloudy whites point to lung heat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sound of a child&#39;s voice can vary in weight and tone. A light sound indicates weakness, while a heavy and murky sound suggests pain and wind. A loud cry signifies uncontrolled heat and desire. A hasty sound reveals fright, a muffled one indicates phlegm, a straining sound suggests cold, a choking sound signals obstructed breath, shortness of breath indicates suffocation, sneezing shows a cold or fright, and a deep, silent sound suggests heaviness; a murky, quiet sound indicates accumulation of illness, as does a child who is born and does not cry much, and those who cough lightly are likely to die young. </p>
<p>Crying can differ in dryness and wetness. A direct sound without tears indicates pain, continuous sounds without cessation and abundant tears suggest fright, a dry and harsh sound reveals difficulty in healing, while a hoarse and hurried voice indicates exposure to cold.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The liver governs emotions. A red face indicates wind-heat, a blue face signifies fright, a yellow face suggests spleen deficiency, and excessive swelling indicates internal heat. Mental unease points to qi heat, while a hoarse voice suggests wind injury. </p>
<p>When fire suddenly flares, it can shock the qi, leading to certain death. If symptoms arise at midnight, there are often mouth sores that require immediate attention. The coarse grains differ from refined ones, just as rough cloth differs from silk. It’s essential to discern internal conditions from external appearances; do not look for a sword by marking a boat.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Examination</strong></p>
<p>The forehead pulse can feel hot or cold; both indicate vomiting and gastrointestinal distress. If the index finger feels hot and the chest is full, it suggests unidentifiable heat causing breast discomfort. Heat above and cold below with internal heat requires careful observation, especially if mixed with fright, which is indicated by the middle finger. The index finger relates to wind and the three vital gates. </p>
<p>For men, the left side is yang and the right is yin, while for women, it is the opposite. However, both genders encompass yin and yang; therefore, both hands should be evaluated. The left hand corresponds to the heart and liver; the right hand to the lungs and spleen, allowing for flexible interpretation. A red line-like pattern on the left hand indicates heat and fright; a similar pattern on the right indicates spleen accumulation and fright. </p>
<p>Triangular patterns suggest lung heat, wind phlegm, and night crying. If there is no pulse at the wind gate, there is no illness; a pulse indicates mild disease; the qi gate signals severe illness; and at the life gate, a short, tiny red-yellow pulse with light external signs is not a cause for concern. However, if the three gates show a bluish-black mark with severe external signs, it indicates death. </p>

If there are three lines like flowing pearls or grains of rice connected in two or three points, whether manifesting on the face or body, the condition is particularly critical.</p>
<p>The qi deficiency points inward, while the wind deficiency points outward; lateral left indicates injury from wind, and lateral right indicates injury from cold. The dual hooks and three bends indicate damage from cold stiffness, with a pulse chaotic like parasitic worms gathering. The gun-shaped phlegm heat causes seizures, while the dual-charactered food poison leads to difficult accumulation. For children aged three to five, check for breath on all three finger joints.</p>
<p>The floating and surging wind indicates high counts of surprise; the floating and sluggish may point to wind damage, and the surging tightness indicates cold damage. A tight pulse signifies serious cold accumulation; if the pulse is tight like a cord, it points to wind epilepsy, while a deep and slow pulse suggests difficulty in emulsification. Abdominal pain and tightness indicate significant blockage; if deep and rapid, think of cold in the bones. Long and tight pulses often suggest phlegm and wind in the diaphragm, while a tight pulse indicates disharmony of qi.</p>
<p>A rapid and tight pulse and signs of surprise lead to limb spasms, with a floating and surging pulse resembling fire at the stomach; a single thin and sallow pulse may indicate a gnawing condition.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse at the front is greater and smaller at the back, indicating that the energy is blocked. If the size is uneven, it signifies malice. When the four conditions are full, there is much suffering and deep pain in the abdomen. Slippery injuries come from wetness and cold. The long strings reveal clearly contradictory signs. When it reaches five at night, it is often floating; by six, it becomes fine and distinct by day. Pure Yang at six signifies balance; five indicates deficiency, four indicates illness, three reveals detachment, while seven and eight indicate lighter ailments, and nine and ten indicate severity, with eleven and twelve leading to death. This is the profound teaching passed down by the sage.</p>
<p>As for the method for children’s pulses:</p>
<p>In children, the pulse is whole; floating and sinking are key. Floating is the exterior, sinking the interior, thus knowing its source. Sizes vary with smoothness; deficiency and firmness pace slowly. Each follows that of adults for verification and treatment.</p>
<p>Regarding the medicinal prescription:</p>
<p>Pediatrics was not recorded in the &quot;Suwen&quot;; it was Bian Que who first acknowledged children’s medicine. Shock and accumulation are the main issues; rashes and variola are especially peculiar. Children’s illnesses are similar to adults, but they often have more combinations of shock, accumulation, and rashes. For shock, treat with cooling, warmth, and urgency; cinnabar and dragon brain are lifesavers. For accumulation, dissolve, transform, and purge, starting with purple frost and white cakes. For wind and sensitivity, Qianghuo and Da Qing Gao should be boiled; for coughs with phlegm and wheezing, Tingniubai Bu pills are advisable. Raw rhinoceros, purple sunshine, and lianqiao decoction can relieve heat; Tianyi Guanyin silver-white powder is good for adjusting weak stomach and spleen. Ah! Better to treat ten men than one woman.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Discussion on Child Health</h3>
<p>The text states: For children aged six years and younger, there is little recorded in classical texts about diseases that are difficult to treat, and there are no established details on this matter. Specifically, this refers to infants who are unable to speak; if they are sick, there is no way to inquire about their suffering, hence the lack of recorded information. Those who can speak are able to communicate their conditions. Is it conceivable that a child over six years old cannot speak? The only ones who cannot speak are infants aged one or two. Thus, the ancients indicated that those who are unable to speak are very young. When ill, their skin is not fully developed, and it is difficult to distinguish their condition; symptoms may fluctuate and intertwine, with subtle energy and blood. Accurate diagnosis through palpation is indeed challenging. Hence, observing their physical appearance and correlating it with symptoms can reveal the source of the illness. The method of observation requires a calm demeanor and focused intention, avoiding distractions caused by emotions. One must not observe the child when they are crying or just waking up, as their appearance may be misleading. Ideally, observations should take place after the hour of Chen (7 AM - 9 AM) and before the hour of Si (1 PM - 3 PM), in summer when it’s not too hot, and in winter when it’s not too warm, ensuring that the external appearance is unclouded and internal energy is relaxed, making it suitable for clear observation. The &quot;Holy Wisdom Classic&quot; states: Knowledgeable individuals can discern the balance of strong and weak, brave and timid, observing their states of fullness and emptiness, and understanding the implications of cold and warmth, balancing yin and yang, determining the severity of illness and treatment urgency according to symptoms, so there&#39;s no need to struggle with difficult cases. The discussions are extensive and complex, making it hard to grasp fully. Now, let’s extract the relevant points and organize them accordingly.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: If a patient has a yellow face with blue eyes, a yellow face with red eyes, or a yellow face with black eyes, they will not die. The &quot;Shengji Jing&quot; says: The spleen is the true foundation; when the face is yellow, it must be due to the exterior manifestation of true qi. However, if the face is blue with red eyes, blue with white eyes, blue with black eyes, black with white eyes, or red with blue eyes, they are all signs of imminent death, as the color of the spleen is absent, indicating that true qi has already been exhausted.</p>
<h3>Death Colors from the &quot;Jinkui&quot;</h3>
<p>For young children, if they have a completely black face, or if black surrounds the mouth and extends to the eyes or the area between the eyebrows, or if there&#39;s darkness in the middle of the face, all are signs of death. If there is a blue discoloration extending across the face and into the eyes or ears, it indicates death. Furthermore, if the eyes lack brightness and there are objects resembling a horizontal red needle within them, this signifies death.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For any child who is ill, if there is a blue-black color on the face resembling a veil, stretching from the hairline to the center of the forehead, regardless of the severity of symptoms, death occurs within sixty days; if it reaches the tip of the nose, death occurs within one month; if it reaches the philtrum, death occurs within ten days; if it covers the entire face, death occurs on the same day.</p>
<p>Regarding the color on the nose:</p>
<p>The &quot;Seng Ji Jing&quot; states: A blue color at the tip of the nose indicates cold in the abdomen; black indicates water vapor; white indicates lack of blood; yellow indicates cold in the chest; red indicates the presence of wind; vibrant color indicates retained fluid.</p>
<p>Regarding the color in the eyes:</p>
<p>Red indicates heat in the heart; light red indicates empty heat; blue indicates heat in the liver; pale indicates liver deficiency; yellow indicates heat in the spleen; a non-spirited color indicates kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>Patterns and signs in various places:</p>
<p>At the back of the ear, above the complete bone, if there are blue veins like lines in three or two paths, and if lying down is uncomfortable, this indicates a chronic illness. One should puncture to let the blood out as a minor treatment. If it bursts on its own, it indicates an impending death. On the flesh above the fish joint of the left thumb, if the tendons are blue-black, this indicates cold in the stomach; red-yellow indicates heat; mixed red-blue-black indicates both cold and heat; if short and blue, it indicates a lack of energy. </p>
<p>At the junction of the fingers, between the thumb and the index finger, above the tiger&#39;s mouth, if there are lines of tendons, observe the color and whether they are straight or curved to determine the illness. If the lines are straight, it signifies fright; if curved, it indicates injury; if hidden, it indicates wind; external curves indicate cold; internal curves indicate food.</p>
<p>A verse states:<br>&quot;In the tiger&#39;s mouth, if the blue lines are straight, know that there is fright in the limbs.<br>Black signifies the water element, red indicates fire soaring high.<br>Light red results from fright, while curved purple suggests injury might lie.<br>Cold outside, and food within, the hidden signs determine the winds arise.&quot;<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a></p></div>

<p>The shape resembling a hanging needle indicates diarrhea and dysentery; in the Qi Pass, it signifies cold damage with vomiting and diarrhea; in the Wind Pass, it relates to shock caused by wind; in the Life Pass, it indicates lingering fright with severe symptoms. A song says: &quot;When shaped like a hanging needle, diarrhea is abundant, shock with body heat definitely disturbs harmony.

In the realm of respiration, it relates to phlegm, cough, and virtuous accumulations; in the realm of wind, it corresponds to shock, wheezing, and phlegm; in the life-domain, it leads to distress without remedy. The song says:<br>&quot;The form resembles the character for water, the lung is shocked,<br>With hidden accumulations passed down, the complexion turns blue.<br>There’s phlegm above the diaphragm that needs treatment,<br>If the life-domain is bypassed, there is no tranquility.&quot;  </p>
<p>The shape of the character &quot;乙,&quot; also called the middle curve, is associated with shock from food. In the realm of respiration, it governs injury from food, vomiting, and diarrhea; in the realm of wind, it corresponds to transformations of wind. The shape of &quot;乙&quot; pertains to the liver, which is in conflict with the spleen; in the life-domain, it leads to chronic spleen wind, with no remedy.

If one has not passed the three gates, it is advisable to treat early; if passed, do not discuss further. The elder presents a bow shape, the younger a ring shape, both signify accumulation. In the air gate, there is regurgitation of heat; in the wind gate, extreme emaciation; at the life gate, untreatable.</p>
<p>The song says: The circular arc shape with yellowed qi, craving earth is common. This illness requires early attention from a skilled physician; if it has reached the three gates, then life is endangered.</p>
<p>Disordered patterns indicate pain from parasites. In the air gate, it signifies disharmony with qi, with accumulations of parasites that consume living organisms; in the wind gate, it indicates pain from parasitic bites in the abdomen; at the life gate, the illness is extremely difficult to cure.</p>
<p>The song says: The chaotic patterns denote parasites; they cry out day and night without restraint. Seeking divine help yields no response; calm the parasites and remove the accumulation to attain health.</p>

<p>When sick and struggling, sweat emerges, like pearls yet not flowing; hair on the head stands upright, lips dry and parched, cold air from the mouth and nose, the head and feet touch; lying down as if bound, limbs droop and hang, hands and feet are cold.</p>
<p><strong>Song of the Death Signs of Tong Zhenzi</strong></p>
<p>The lips are sunken, dry; the eyes stare straight; cold air in the mouth; lying as if in a daze. The body is stiff, hands and feet soft; hands are cold, head bowed, no hope for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Theory</strong></p>
<p>All children inherit, organs, Qi, blood, nourishment, and form; though born, all are complete. However, before speaking, during the changing process, the blood and Qi are not yet filled, the skin is not firm, the muscles and bones are not strong, and the pulse pattern is not yet formed. If there is illness, it is difficult to diagnose or inquire about. Hence, the sages say that childhood illnesses are hard to treat because there is no firm basis to rely on. Thus, it is established to observe the appearance and color. A child is born after five hundred seventy-six days; once the changes are complete, Qi and blood nourish, spirit is different, muscles and bones are strong, pulse is whole, and then one can diagnose and inquire. Those who think a child&#39;s pulse differs from that of adults do not grasp the fundamental aspect of diagnosis and treatment. The pulse&#39;s length, shortness, slowness, and quickness depend on the form, and not strictly on numbers. The classics say that a child&#39;s pulse is often like a sparrow&#39;s fight, focusing on the three regions as the main part; if the pulse is small, the little and fine ones are flat. Many schools of thought have much to say; here I select what is appropriate. Master Sun said: A child&#39;s pulse is indeed difficult to differentiate between exterior and interior.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>&quot;Precious Mirror&quot;:</strong> The pulses of the four seasons are: Spring is represented by the string (xian), Summer by the flooding (hong), Autumn by the floating (fu), and Winter by the sinking (chen). Each season’s pulse is slow, and one must observe the ruling and ministerial states to diagnose the illness. For instance, if in Spring the pulse is string-like and floating, the disease is in the superficial layers, indicating Yang and conformity, hence easy to treat. But if it is string-like and sinking, the illness resides deeper in the organs, indicating Yin and opposition, thus difficult to treat. I followed this pattern for the other times.</p>
<p><strong>Wang&#39;s Pulse Song:</strong> After feeding, if a child vomits and has a chaotic pulse with no concerns, in times of tightness and cold, a slow pulse indicates the inability to digest milk. Tight, rapid, and weak pulses also lead to suffering; excess phlegm and Qi disturbances provoke wind. In cases of dysentery with urgent abdominal pain, a large floating pulse points to the pathway of the source.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Pulse Classics&quot; states:</strong> In children, a rapid pulse is labeled as fast; when it reaches seven or eight beats per breath, it&#39;s considered normal. Fewer beats indicate deficiency, and excessive beats indicate excess.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;True Communication Song&quot;:</strong> In children aged three to five, one must observe that the breathing rate should be around eight breaths. Nine signifies discomfort, and ten indicates distress; variations in length and size indicate external disturbances.</p>
<p>It continues: A tight pulse in children indicates wind-related convulsions; a sinking pulse requires knowledge as it suggests difficulty with digestion. Sharp abdominal pain with a tight string-like pulse indicates severity, while a sinking and rapid pulse reveals heat residing within the bones.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart pulse is full and broad while the liver pulse is small and urgent, indicating fright and convulsions. A rapid and small heart pulse indicates consumption and strangury. A rapid pulse indicates heat. A pulse that rises and falls smoothly at the wrist indicates fright. An uneven pulse of different sizes at the wrist indicates transformation or steaming.</p>
<p>If the left wrist has no pulse, accompanied by heart pain, internal heat, vomiting, oral ulcers, possible coughing, a hard voice in the throat, and sweating on the head, this is caused by a wet nurse consuming cold food affecting the infant. Moreover, a disordered pulse will lead to vomiting. </p>
<p>If the right wrist has no pulse, with fullness in the chest, shortness of breath, vomiting, belching, and sounds in the throat, this is from a wet nurse carrying the child and exposing them to wind and cold.</p>
<p>A pulse that feels like a bird pecking and is tense indicates wind convulsions. A pulse that varies in size and does not follow regularity indicates adverse signs.</p>
<p>For children, a pulse that flies indicates the breath rate: eight beats per breathing cycle is normal, nine indicates illness, and ten indicates fatigue. A weak pulse in children signifies a weak condition, while a strong pulse indicates a strong illness. Hence, a rapid fright pulse is urgent, while a slow yearning pulse is feeble.</p>
<p><strong>On the Essentials of Treating Infants</strong></p>
<p>Illness in children is most difficult to treat, as they cannot articulate or discern right from wrong. It requires careful observation and assessment, listening to sounds and observing colors to probe the underlying condition.</p>
<p><strong>Listening to Sounds</strong></p>
<p>A light sound indicates weak energy, while a heavy sound with pain suggests a mixture of wind. A long sigh symbolizes stagnant heat, and groaning indicates imminent death. Loud cries indicate excessive fright, while shaking the head suggests a loss of spirit. Not speaking means the heart’s path is blocked; thus, there is no need to use medicine to force a remedy.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

<p>A white film covers the eyes, red veins run through the center. Pulling the hand tight, it becomes rigid like a bow. The fish&#39;s mouth opens frequently, the crow&#39;s voice resembles teeth grinding. Wanting to cry but not producing tears, when cries do come, they are soundless. Thick phlegm sounds in the throat, startled gasps echo in the abdomen. Dysentery heat gathers with abundant pus, while injuries from cold show no sweat.

<p>How to discern the pulse of a young child? Fourteen distinct signs are very clear. Holding them, the body is not warm (blood is cut off); four limbs feel heavy, crying sounds like a crow (stomach is cut off). The nose is dry and black, eyes exhibit a fixed stare (spleen is cut off); crying without tears, drooling appears blue (liver is cut off). Eyebrows are drawn up, fingernails are black; the fontanel swells, suddenly forming a pit (tendons are cut off). The mouth bites people as the fish&#39;s mouth gasps; feet stay straight, the belly is large, blue veins appear (qi is cut off, tendons do not retract).

<p>Red and purple indicate heat from the wind; blue and black suggest deep illness. Excessive whiteness shows weakness of vitality, while yellow indicates damage from diet. Red lips signify thirst and diarrhea; a bluish hue foretells impending death. A dark face is hard to save; a skilled physician must examine closely.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Blood and Qi</strong></p>
<p>The heart is the master of blood, and the liver is the organ of blood; the lungs are the master of qi, and the kidneys are the organ of qi. Blood originates in the heart and is stored in the liver; qi originates in the lungs and is stored in the kidneys. If there is bloody diarrhea, use Wu Ling and Meng Dong to act on the heart’s intent, and Ba Dou and Da Huang to eliminate stagnation; if the illness persists, the blood&#39;s reservoirs cannot nourish, supplementing with Gui and Xiong can stop the diarrhea. If there is coughing and wheezing, use Zhi, Ju, Ginger, and Cinnamon to regulate qi, and Nan Xing and Ban Xia to relieve phlegm; if it still does not rise or fall, qi&#39;s reservoirs cannot be secured, supplementing with Ren Shen and Qi can restore qi to the source. There are exterior and interior illnesses, and treatment has its priorities. The methods of the heart are profound and not to be transmitted. The external corresponds to the symptom, while the internal corresponds to the root. For external pathogens, treat the symptoms, which must be dispersed; for internal injuries, address the root, supplementing and regulating. Urgent cases require symptom treatment, while slower cases can focus on the root. Treating both root and symptom ensures no harm.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a></p></div>

<p>In cases of deficiency heat, the body feels warm. The complexion is pale, the breath is cool, the palms are not hot, both ends are unobstructed, with frequent diarrhea and urination, spontaneous sweating occurs, and one should not attack heat but rather should use warming supplements. In cases of excess heat, the face is red, breathing is heavy, there is thirst and swollen lips, difficulty in lifting clothing, frequent crying and shouting; externally sweating should be induced, while internally purging is appropriate. If the stools are yellow, hard, and dense, with a yellow face and red cheeks, dry lips and a dry mouth, both externally and internally are hot. If there is benefit, do not supplement, for fear that heat will re-emerge. If residual heat does not subside, there is no need for excessive concern. Use only cooling medicines; eliminate heat to prevent cold from arising. Remove heat to address heat, and for deficiency, replenish deficiency. Observe and treat as appropriate, without fixation in treatment.</p>
<p><strong>The Theory of Form and Qi</strong></p>
<p>Observing form and Qi requires careful attention. First clarify the parts and closely examine the balance of excess and deficiency. Use medicine as necessary to see miraculous effects. A red, hot, and dry forehead indicates wind disturbance. A blue hue at the glabella warns of sudden changes due to fright. If there’s sudden redness and darkness, it signals sinister influence. A blue hue at the root of the nose points to double fright. If redness persists, it suggests contention of thirst. A red lip with severe illness indicates one should not treat. If the eyes are dull, it is contraindicated to act. Unmarked hands and feet, with eyes closed and mouth open. A straight hairline with hoarse voice indicates difficult treatment. If the liver lacks Qi, it is best if kidney water is clear; if the lung is bright and radiant, there is fear of fiery cheeks. Red lips signal thirst, and red cheeks indicate excess surprise. A furrowed brow indicates parental concern.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>General Discussion on Children&#39;s Illnesses</h3>
<p>In ancient times, children&#39;s illnesses were referred to as the &quot;mute category&quot; because their inability to communicate makes it difficult to assess their condition. Thus, it was said one would rather treat ten men than one woman, and rather treat ten women than one child, highlighting the difficulty in treating children. However, in my view, among the three, children are actually the easiest to treat. Why do I say this? It is because children&#39;s ailments, if not caused by external wind and cold, stem from internal issues such as dietary imbalance, leading to conditions like convulsions, vomiting, diarrhea, and various fevers; they are merely a few types. Moreover, children&#39;s organs are clear and responsive, and if one can correctly ascertain their fundamental issue and address it, a single medicine can cure them, unlike the chronic and stubborn ailments often found in men and women, which is why I deem it easy. </p>
<p>People often say it is difficult because of the challenge in distinguishing their conditions; I maintain it is easy because of its treatability. If one misidentifies the issue, then indeed, it becomes difficult. However, the method of diagnosis is simply to discern the symptoms of exterior and interior, cold and heat, deficiency and excess. Once the six factors are clearly understood, how can treatment be difficult? Thus, for any external pathogen, there must be exterior symptoms without interior signs, such as fever, headache, tightness without sweating, or conditions similar to wind constriction. For internal injuries, there would be only interior symptoms without exterior signs, such as vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pains, and bloating, or conditions like convulsions and accumulations. Heat must present with heat symptoms, such as extreme heat, agitation, and the presence of abscesses. Cold must display cold symptoms, such as clear diarrhea, absence of heat, no agitation, and a preference for warmth.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The four conditions presented here signify the signs of cold and heat, which are quite easy to distinguish. However, among these four, it is the concepts of &quot;emptiness&quot; and &quot;fullness&quot; that are of utmost importance. There is the emptiness and fullness of physical appearance, the emptiness and fullness of sound, and the emptiness and fullness of pulse and breath. For instance, there are differences between individuals with strong and weak constitutions; there are distinctions between those with reddish complexions and those with pale or greenish ones; there is a variance between vigorous voices and timid, short ones; and there are differences between smooth, strong pulses and weak, thin ones. Therefore, it is essential to introspect on the pulse condition, externally observe the physical appearance and energy, and thoroughly assess the illness. By considering these factors with careful examination, how could one then find it difficult to ascertain emptiness and fullness? If there is indeed fullness or signs of heat, treatment must be directed toward the root cause.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Indeed, the method for treating symptoms should be precise, straightforward, and light, suitable for the condition at hand. When a disease presents itself, one must not disturb the body&#39;s vital energy; this is the skill of a master. If one only sees superficial appearances, they should not rashly attack or consume resources arbitrarily. If what one sees is not genuine, it is not advisable to hastily eliminate the symptoms, as it may also be harmless. It is important to realize that a child, with a delicate body and undeveloped energy and blood, has fragile organs; even slight injuries or impairments can lead to significant decline, and a mistake in treatment can be unbearable for them. How much worse would it be for them otherwise? Furthermore, without nurturing the natural vitality, and only knowing how to exploit it, will lead to immediate harm and lifelong weakness. This is truly lamentable. All of this genuinely seeks the fundamental path and is indeed the essential foundation in pediatric medicine. Though it may seem unremarkable when discussed, the ignorance of many is vast, which is why I emphasize this toward the beginning of my writing.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Observations on Life and Death</strong></p>
<p>To observe children, sound should be prioritized, followed by color. Generally, a clear and bright sound indicates life, while a muffled sound suggests illness, and silence indicates a lack of longevity. If a child suddenly cries out loudly without apparent illness, one must closely examine their body for potential sores or toxins, which should be treated immediately. </p>
<p>If the umbilical cord has no blood, the child is likely alive; a silver-white cord indicates life. A short, swollen purple cord, after being cut, may be safe if the purple blood is pressed out. A wide forehead indicates longevity. A black and open sutural line suggests longevity. If a child is born resembling a water bubble, this is a bad sign. </p>
<p>A face that is slightly yellow indicates good fortune. If born with a powdery white and floral appearance, it surely indicates death from umbilical wind.<br>If born with loose skin and thin flesh, and then gains weight significantly after five or six days, this also suggests a risk of umbilical wind. If born with skin that is not smooth, the child will die. </p>
<p>Crying without sound indicates death. Crying without tears indicates death. A tongue that resembles pig liver indicates death. Purple markings at the corners of the mouth resembling shrimp whiskers indicate death. </p>
<p>Thick and long hair suggests life; fine and soft, non-releasing hair indicates death. If the male genitalia do not appear, the child will die. If the scrotum does not retract, or if it is white or red, the child will die. </p>
<p>A child without an anal opening will die. [Note: There are cases today where this can be treated. The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium&quot; records therapeutic methods, detailing medical cases related to fetal conditions. Medical practitioners should thoroughly investigate both internal and external treatments in such cases.] If the flesh on the buttocks does not develop, the child will die.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a></p></div>

<p>Regarding pulse diagnosis:</p>
<p>When a child’s form is complete and meridians are fully developed, as soon as they are born, their pulse can be discerned. Thus, the discussion of deficiency and excess states: if an infant has a weak, suspended pulse and warm hands and feet, they will live; if cold, they will die. If an infant suffers from wind-heat and has wheezing and loud breathing, with a strong, large pulse, if it is slow, they will live; if rapid, they will die. This is the basis of Xuānqí’s diagnosis of children, which always emphasizes the pulse and combines it with symptom interpretation. In works such as the &quot;Water Mirror Classic&quot; and &quot;Complete Guide to Young Hearts,&quot; it is stated that for children above three years old, one should observe the pulse in relation to the Tiger Mouth (thumb), and the Yin (liver) and Chen (spleen) positions based on wind and vital conditions. Among these observations, it is stated that a pulse starting at the Yin position and not reaching the Mao position is easy to treat; if it connects to the Mao position, it is difficult to treat; if Yin invades Mao or Mao excessively invades Chen, the chance of saving them is one in ten. </p>
<p>Such remarks should only be applied in critical situations to discern fortune and misfortune. Furthermore, different colors are associated with various ailments: purple indicates wind, red signifies febrile illness, green represents fright, white denotes malnutrition, and so on, including specific colors for various fright scenarios. However, can such simple color codes really distinguish these conditions accurately? This is the utmost folly—relying on such superficial observations is absurd.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In today&#39;s pediatric examinations, there is seldom any method that does not rely on this framework; they do not understand the pulse and speak without any basis. If one were to inquire whether their hearts indeed possess any definitive insights, the answer would be uncertain, yet they wish to use children as subjects for experimentation, which is truly lamentable. Therefore, in diagnosing children, since their speech is unclear, it is all the more essential to prioritize the pulse, while also considering shape, color, and sound, ensuring a thorough approach. However, the pulse of children is not as varied as that of adults; one must observe the four aspects of strength, weakness, tension, and urgency in the pulse, as these are the key points for children. The strength and weakness can reveal vacuity and fullness, while tension and urgency can indicate the presence of evil or righteousness. Once these four aspects are clear, it matters not the various symptoms, but rather align the pulse with the illness and consider the causes behind these four aspects—this way, one will find an abundant source of knowledge and encounter truth in all cases. Further distinguishing with sound and color provides even more certainty; hence, how can one escape scrutiny? This is the most lively and ingenious method of thought. If one were to rely solely on a single pulse to determine a disease, the disease could still encompass various pulses, where the genuine and the false could intermingle, leading to a precarious conclusion that is hard to substantiate. Nevertheless, the method must not be discarded; one must carefully discern and choose those that possess sound reasoning.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sound</strong></p>
<p>Sound is produced by breath; when breath is robust, the sound is strong, and when breath is weak, the sound is timid. Therefore, to discern the fullness or emptiness of breath, one must first consider sound. As stated in various sections of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot;: when there is speech that is faint, yet continues all day, this indicates a depletion of breath; if one says there is excess in the sea of chi, and feels a fullness in the chest with flushed face, then if the sea of chi is insufficient, the breath is too weak to speak; it is said that when the heart&#39;s chi is deficient, one feels sadness, while when sufficient, one cannot stop laughing; when the hand&#39;s lesser yin is deficient, one cannot speak; when there is internal depletion leading to loss of voice, this indicates kidney deficiency. Hua Yuanhua says: the yang state is often talkative, while the yin condition is silent; those who talk a lot are easier to treat, while the silent are difficult to nourish. All of this distinguishes between the fullness and emptiness of sound, thus the sages discern emotions through sound, understanding everything.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The presence of red, black, and blue indicates the cold and hot energies. A short blue hue signifies a deficiency of energy.

<p>Blue signifies wind energy, relates to liver disorders, and reflects the Yin deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, leads to abdominal pain, may indicate sudden fright affecting the heart and gallbladder energy, and suggests a possibility of convulsive states; one should examine the combined colors to differentiate between acute and chronic conditions.</p>
<p>White signifies energy deficiency, and in serious cases, energy collapse. It represents an absence of fire and indicates insufficiency of the spleen and lungs. White with blue indicates chronic fright and issues related to diarrhea affecting the large and small intestines.</p>
<p>Red signifies fire, phlegm heat, and conditions of exogenous heat causing signs of disturbance, thirst, irritability, obstruction, and Yang disorder related to shortness of breath, as well as indications of sores, ulcers, and rashes.</p>
<p>Black is associated with water, indicating coldness and Yin energy, showing reversal of flow and extreme pain. Deep black indicates a critical condition.</p>
<p>Yellow signifies accumulation, masses, spleen disorders, distension, and splenic ailments. Yellow accompanied by white suggests cold and weakness of the spleen, indicative of energy deficiency and lack of spirit. Yellow with blue indicates deficiency causing diarrhea and chronic spleen wind; yellow with red relates to heat in the spleen.</p>
<p>Bright red or fluctuating redness in the cheeks indicates a facade of Yang, showing true weakness of Yin. This does not align with conditions of Yang excess and should not be equated with manifestations of heat and redness.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Medical Principles for Treating Children</h3>
<p>Diseases in children are often hard to detect, but their root causes generally have specific origins. Therefore, those who practice medicine must first observe the innate qualities of the parents, with a particular emphasis on the mother&#39;s condition. If the mother has a lot of internal heat, the child will likely have heat-related issues; if the mother is cold, the child may have cold-related problems; if the mother’s spleen and kidneys are deficient, the child will exhibit similar deficiencies. Common symptoms such as soft bones, delayed walking, late teething, slow speech, a wide fontanel, malnutrition, and diarrhea often stem from the mother&#39;s condition. Although both parents contribute to the child&#39;s traits, the mother&#39;s influence is more immediate, while the father&#39;s is more distant. If one parent is strong and the other weak, it can lead to an imbalance in the child&#39;s qualities, which must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>As the child grows, if they indulge excessively or if their upbringing is improper, they may develop health issues; thus, it is essential to investigate the causes and address them appropriately. If there is a deficiency in innate vitality, nurturing later development is vital for longevity. Even if both parents are robust, excessive desires or inadequate care can lead to a variety of ailments, and even a seemingly strong child can face early death. The underlying principles here are subtle and depend on understanding both the constants and the changes in health.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Pediatric Medicine</strong></p>
<p>Children&#39;s blood and energy are not yet fully developed, akin to tender sprouts; any injury or damage leads to significant deterioration. Therefore, it is crucial to nurture them during normal times and avoid reckless purging and elimination. If there is food stagnation causing bloating and pain, it is advisable to temporarily relieve it; if there are symptoms of wind and cold causing fever, a temporary dispersal is appropriate; if there is substantial heat with phlegm and fire, a temporary clearance is warranted. This cannot be avoided. </p>
<p>Beyond this, if there are no sudden excessive symptoms, but the child is pale, undernourished, or showing signs of mild fever, diarrhea, exhaustion, etc., this is due to the insufficiency of the spleen and kidneys, leading to weak blood and energy. When pediatricians observe these signs, they often simply identify it as food accumulation and phlegm heat, tending to focus solely on purging and clearing, and excessively using cooling treatments, which gradually deplete the original vitality. If another illness occurs, the child will be unable to withstand it. This is a significant concern in pediatric practice that must not be overlooked.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Errors of Medicinal Treatment</h3>
<p>Children, with their unformed vitality, rely on their early years for the foundation of their future health. Thus, dietary habits should be carefully adjusted, and the use of medicines must be particularly cautious. Nowadays, pediatric practitioners, lacking knowledge of this fundamental principle and having no clear understanding, only seek immediate results. Consequently, when a child becomes ill, regardless of whether the condition is due to deficiency or excess, cold or heat, they resort to recipes that primarily aim to dispel wind, eliminate food stagnation, clear phlegm, and lower fire, all consisting of over twenty ingredients. This approach is mixed together and misrepresented as reliable, which is absurd. If a child has a certain ailment and is treated with these medicines, their illness will be exacerbated; if there is no ailment, then their vital energy will be harmed. Given that children&#39;s vital energy is limited, how can they avoid damage that leads to unpredictable changes? This misunderstanding represents a grave issue in contemporary pediatrics, highlighting the danger of careless treatment. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are those who care for their children and, noticing them looking pale, thin, or weak, grow concerned. They consult common practitioners, who, instead of diagnosing phlegm or fire, hastily attribute it to food accumulation and recommend the constant use of products like Fat Child Pills or Baohe Pills. Little do they realize that Fat Child Pills, composed of bitter and cold ingredients, severely damage the original yang; while Baohe Pills, designed for expulsion, drastically deplete stomach energy. They think they are nurturing the child when in fact, it only serves to make a thin child even thinner; they believe they are ensuring harmony, when in truth, it creates disharmony.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Just like the Baolong pill and similar medicines, they should not be used lightly or repeatedly. I once saw the son of a wealthy man, who often had phlegm and would occasionally shout out, and whenever he fell ill, he would take this pill and instantly recover. At that time, it was thought to be a miraculous remedy, and this happened more than ten times. As he grew older, he became completely ignorant, a mere simpleton; could this not be due to the damage to his vital essence? Such powerful medicines must be used with great caution. Therefore, they should only be used for genuine conditions: real heat and deficiency of the body warrant the use of Feier pill and cold remedies; genuine food stagnation requires the Baohuo pill and digestive aids; true phlegmatic heat with shortness of breath calls for the Baolong pill and phlegm dissolvers. Even when using these, one should merely address the immediate illness; they cannot be used excessively. If there is no actual pathogen to grapple with, and one observes various symptoms, they often stem from a loss of vital energy. In such cases, one should focus on nurturing and replenishing, as this is the true way to preserve vitality. If one is unaware of this and simply uses remedies like Feier and Baohuo for protection, oblivious to the fact that a child has limited vital energy and is already weakened by illness, then the physician’s actions would only further damage it, resulting in very few not withering away. Moreover, substances such as Rhubarb, Glauber’s salt, black charcoal, Yan flower, Euphorbia, Sanguisorba, and Mugwort should not be used lightly unless absolutely necessary.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Record of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>Children&#39;s Medicine Treatment Methods</strong></p>
<p>In children&#39;s medicine, once the essentials are grasped, there are no difficult cases. Now, I will transmit a method for all future children to attain longevity. The method involves first observing the complexion, then checking the pulse. When a child is ill, the complexion must be vivid. One can discern it by examining the point above the nose and between the eyes, at the center. </p>
<p>If the complexion is red, it indicates heart heat; if red veins are visibly straight across the bridge of the nose, it further confirms heart heat. A purple complexion suggests severe heart heat, with lung heat also present. A green complexion indicates liver wind; if green veins appear straight, it signifies liver heat; if they are horizontal, it also indicates liver heat; the straight ones suggest rising wind, while the horizontal ones suggest descending wind. </p>
<p>If the complexion is black, it indicates severe wind with cold in the kidneys. A white complexion indicates phlegm in the lungs. A yellow complexion suggests deficiencies in the spleen and stomach leading to diarrhea; yellow veins visible across the bridge of the nose, regardless of being horizontal or straight, are all signs of spleen and stomach issues. These are the only few colors relevant, thus one can determine the child&#39;s illness at a glance. </p>
<p>For adults, pulses are checked at the cun, guan, and chi positions; the same applies to children but they don’t require checking all three. It suffices to observe whether there is a pulse or not. A vibrant pulse indicates heat, while an absent pulse indicates cold. Among those that are present, a floating pulse suggests wind, a sinking pulse suggests cold, a slow pulse suggests dampness, a taut pulse suggests evil qi, and a slippery pulse suggests phlegm; this is all. There is no need to examine the seven superficial and eight deep pulses. If one understands my method, then there is no need to read pulse classics. If the pulse has a stop, it indicates pain. I need not elaborate further.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a></p></div>

<p>For the third formula: to treat symptoms of deficiency and cold, night sweats, crying and sleeplessness at night, anxiety, persistent cough, slow movement, slow speech, and conditions that may develop into tuberculosis. The formula includes three qian of cooked rehmannia, two qian of cornelian cherry, two qian of ophiopogon, five fen of northern five-flavor fruit, two qian of original root, two qian of white atractylodes, one qian of poria, three qian of coix seed, one qian of tree peony bark, two qian of sand ginseng, two qian of earth bone bark, prepared with water.

This is because the middle jiao processes the turbid residues and transforms the essence into blood, circulating in the meridians, termed as nutrient qi. Food and drink normally reside together in the stomach, forming residue that descends into the large intestine, where it mixes with transformed fluid and seeps into the bladder. If the stool is red and differentiated, it implies that the blood in the middle jiao is being expelled along with the residue. When there is diarrhea, the large intestine is deficient and cannot properly transform. In this case, the gastrointestinal system fails to nourish the pulse with its essence, hence the weak pulse.

If the pulse shows five colors, such as blue due to fright or purple due to diarrhea, one should categorize these accordingly.

If the head and body are warm, with yellowish stools and abdominal heat, use Sijun San, Lianqiao Drink, or Sanhuang Pills.

A deep and slow pulse with an intermittent fever indicates stomach cold; warming it will bring relief. The rule states: a child’s pulse is tight in cases of wind convulsions; a deep and slow pulse with food stagnation leads to frequent vomiting. A tense and rapid pulse indicates discord in Qi, while a fast pulse suggests fright preventing spirit from settling. A cold pulse is deep and fine, while a wind pulse is floating. Firm stools that are difficult or prolonged indicate issues. If abdominal pain leads to tight and tense pulses, chaotic pulses are a sign that treatment may be futile. During the time of transformation, the pulse must be chaotic; without treatment, false diagnoses may follow. A single fine pulse with signs of malnutrition indicates the presence of worms, and an uneven pulse size signifies adverse signs. A slow and deep pulse with intermittent fever indicates an internal invasion of stomach cold. Excessive diarrhea with a strong pulse is difficult to treat; careful consideration and examination are necessary.

Sudden wind, fever, and cough with phlegm should not be neglected when taking life-preserving pills. For acute and chronic shocks, the purple gold pill is essential before the rashes appear. For vomiting and diarrhea with abdominal pain, aiding the stomach is advised; sores in the lips and mouth need to neutralize the toxins. For tidal fever, use the Xin Xin powder; for vomiting, excessive use of needles and pills is necessary. Various types of malnutrition can all use aloe, preventing the need for difficult inquiries and painful searches. ### Discussion on Pediatrics In the medical path, treating conditions according to the major pulse is particularly challenging, and pediatric cases are even more difficult. This is because children’s organs are delicate, their skin and bones tender, their blood and qi are not robust, their meridians are like threads, and their pulses fine as hairs. They easily fluctuate between deficiency and excess, cold and heat. Furthermore, they cannot speak, point with their hands, or indicate where they are in pain. Thus, it is rare for someone to accurately diagnose their conditions without examining their form and color, listening to sounds, and feeling the pulse to identify the source of the illness and understand their yin and yang, inner and outer, deficiency and excess. ### Tiger Mouth Pulse The first section: red stripes indicate shock from birds or external people. A gentle red stripe signals fire shock; black stripes indicate water shock; green stripes represent thunder or four-foot shock; slightly curled hidden green stripes denote urgent wind conditions.

Only when the transformation and steaming are completed and the energies of yin and yang are sufficient, can one observe the pulse. At the age of childhood, the formation of yin and yang begins. It is said that a boy is called \"tiao\" at the age of seven, when his original yang energy emerges; a girl is called \"chen\" at eight, when her yin and yang are fully formed. Therefore, before reaching the ages of tiao and chen, they are referred to as pure yang. After surpassing the tiao and chen ages, they are called children, and only then can the pulse be observed. For a child from birth to half a year old, if there is illness, one should quickly examine the forehead, above the brows, and at the hairline, using the ring finger, middle finger, and index finger to gently press. If all three fingers are hot, it indicates a cold condition resulting in nasal congestion and coarse breathing; if all three fingers are cold, it suggests vomiting and diarrhea. If the index finger is hot, the chest is narrow; if the ring finger is hot, there is disharmony with milk and food, leading to illness. After six months, one can begin to observe the pulse at the tiger mouth area. After one year, observe both the tiger mouth and the pulse of one finger. If after five hundred sixty-four days, the steaming is sufficient, only one finger pulse should be observed by pressing with the index finger, rolling it up and down, and dividing into three sections. The term \"three sections\" here does not refer to cun, guan, and chi. For children, the three sections are: looking at the facial color as one section, the pulse patterns at the tiger mouth as the second section, and the single finger pulse as the third section. The five pulses include pressing on the forehead above and on Tai Chong below, thus combining the three sections to make five pulses. If a child is ill and shows no severe symptoms, it is not necessary to constantly examine the pulse at Tai Chong, as this pulse is crucial for determining life and death."},{"anchor":"trans-27p","marker":"27p","type":"translation","text":"In a person aged seven or eight, a pulse rate of six beats per breath is typical; eight indicates heat, nine indicates wind, five indicates deficiency, four indicates harm, three indicates collapse, two indicates death. A pulse rate of ten suggests illness and fatigue, resulting in a gaunt appearance. If the body is corpulent and pale, with a pulse rate of eleven or twelve, it is termed deficiency, indicating death from wind sickness and a disordered pulse. If the pulse rate is one or two beats per breath, it signifies an absence of pulse, and the person will likely experience cold and eventually die slowly. A pulse rate of eleven or twelve signifies a rapid pulse, with death likely occurring within three months. What is one breath? One inhale and one exhale constitutes one breath. Breathing means the release of air and the intake of air, which is referred to as one breath. If the pulse feels hard and urgent, it indicates a blockage; if it is small, weak, and fine, it signifies cold; if light and weak, it indicates heat; if there is a sudden strong pulse, it suggests shock; if the pulse is uneven, it indicates a dire condition. Light and rapid pulses signify heat, while deep and firm pulses indicate cold; an uneven pulse suggests a bad prognosis. Rapid pulses indicate tension; light pulses suggest a floating sensation; deep pulses feel firm under pressure; a blocked pulse indicates irregularity; heavy pulses sink deeply; and fine pulses are subtle.

Upper and lower pulses share the same cause of disturbance, as heat causes blockage and a lack of spirit. When the upper pulse is green, it indicates wind in the liver, with straight gazes causing the face to appear greener. The middle pulse corresponds to alarm affecting all four limbs, leading to thirst, restlessness, and confusion. A lower green pulse signifies recurrent alarm roots; relieving heat and manifesting the intestines involves analysis. If both upper and lower pulses are green, it is severe, with only one in ten remaining stable. A red upper pulse suggests excessive wind in the lungs, possibly leading to frequent fever and cough. The middle pulse indicates wind attacking the heart, resulting in abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea. A lower red pulse reflecting severe shock denotes a need to regulate the heart using divine methods. When the upper and lower pulses are both difficult to treat, wide-eyed and open-mouthed, it indicates danger. When the green liver pulse retains its form, closed eyes and body aches signify fragility. In the middle pulse, it points to watery diarrhea and recurring disturbance, with heat causing breathlessness and coughs without respite. A lower green pulse might indicate alarm; efficient medicine can disperse wind and mitigate calamity. If both upper and lower pulses are green and generate heat, the limbs feel cold, signaling urgency. When the upper pulse appears black, the eyes are wide, with loose stools possibly showing a green hue. When observed in the middle, signs reflect thirst; lower heat seems to yield yellow urine with stable bowels. If the lower black pulse reveals accompanying red, frequent diarrhea ensues.

Therefore, a specialist in pediatrics can recognize a child’s potential for longevity or premature death at a glance. If a condition is beyond cure, it will remain uncured. When faced with sickness, observing the form and color allows diagnosis of the five organs, leading to appropriate treatment with tonics or purgatives, revealing remarkable insights. It is particularly challenging to understand a child’s potential longevity; it relies on a skilled practitioner’s keen eye. Adequate form and energy indicate a propensity for longevity, while deficiency suggests premature death. A child’s life derives its energy from the father and its form from the mother. If both parents are robust, the child’s form and energy are abundant; if both are weak, the child’s form and energy are deficient. If the father is strong and the mother weak, energy may be abundant while form is lacking; conversely, if the father is weak and the mother strong, form may be sufficient while energy is lacking."},{"anchor":"trans-66p","marker":"66p","type":"translation","text":"Generally, lifespan, fortune, intelligence, and foolishness are all predetermined; how can one escape this? The attributes of a child rely entirely on the residual energy from their parents for their physical growth; thus, a fat child cannot be born from thin parents, nor can a thin child be born from fat parents. If the child's traits do not align with those of the parents, it becomes difficult to nurture them. Although there may be many issues in their early life, if their physique is appropriate, they tend to have a longer lifespan. A child with a relaxed face and slow head movements, requiring some effort to shape, is a sign of longevity. However, a child who intuitively understands others' intentions, while physically weak and light, is difficult to nurture. The ancients said that like an early-blooming plum flower, which does not witness the cold of the year, or a late-blooming chrysanthemum, which thrives at the end of the year, one knows that late bloomers are a sign of longevity. If a child has a small, dark complexion that is proportionate to their body, they can be nurtured. If the child has a large, pale complexion, it is difficult to nurture them. If a child's physique is weak, the face has many pale spots, and they seem lethargic, they are hard to foster. Conversely, a child who is robust, with bright eyes, a healthy spirit, glossy skin, and good complexion shows signs of longevity. If a child's spirit is strong, they tend to suffer from fewer illnesses, making them easier to raise. However, if they appear worn and are frequently ill, they are difficult to nurture. A child with fewer dark pupils and more white in their eyes, along with a pale complexion, is not a sign of longevity, for even if they grow, they may not reach old age. If a child has large dark pupils and fewer whites, with a dark complexion that is rich and full, one should also observe the clarity of the black and white in their eyes; if they are balanced, this is a sign of health and longevity. If the dark pupils are unstable and shine brightly, even if they grow, they are expected to have eye ailments and may not live to their forties.

White represents a deficiency in qi and blood in the face, hence it suggests malnutrition. Black is an ominous color, indicating the influence of evil. The complexion should be observed according to different regions: the heart influences the forehead, producing a red fiery glow; the left cheek corresponds to wood (liver), while the right cheek relates to metal (lung); the chin signifies the kidneys and the nose relates to the spleen. These five forms correspond to their respective locations: the liver belongs to wood and the east, thus it is observed on the left cheek. The lung is associated with metal and the west, therefore it is checked on the right cheek. The heart pertains to fire and the south, hence it is examined on the forehead. The kidneys relate to water and the north, thus observed at the chin. The spleen corresponds to earth and the center, hence assessed at the nose. Liver illnesses should be observed in the eyes, while the spleen and heart connect through the lips and tongue. Lung issues often appear in the nose, and kidney problems are discerned from the ears.

The spleen governs dampness; when dampness prevails, there will be swelling, and if the face is swollen and yellow, it indicates spleen disease. Accumulation of undigested food leads to chronic issues. Malnutrition is a disease of insufficient fluids. Sparse hair and a pale face indicate blood deficiency. Malnutrition often leads to parasites. In cases of diarrhea, one should be wary if the complexion is fair; if the face is red due to sudden wind, that is also concerning. A pale face with cough indicates true color; blue around the lips and bluish veins signify issues. A saying states: if diarrhea is unpredictable but the spirit is good, it leads to death.

A pulse that reaches three beats on inhalation is considered slow and deficient, lacking strength; these are signs of insufficiency. In assessing children's lifespans, this method of differentiation is used. A pulse that is six beats per breath indicates harmony; the notion of eight beats should not be relied upon. Four beats or less signify a state of deficiency and cold, while eight, nine, or ten beats indicate heat, leading to agitation. A child's pulse typically corresponds to one breath with three beats on inhalation and three beats on exhalation, collectively termed \"one breath.\" Six beats per breath represent a harmonious and healthy pulse.

Four beats per breath are termed \"leaving the canonical,\" while three beats or fewer denote \"diminished pulse,\" associated with cold, imbalanced conditions.

The highest physician treats children by correlating color with pulse and pulse with color; if it is excess, treat with purgatives; if it is deficiency, treat with tonics; if it does not deviate, then regulate it — this is the path to complete health. For instance, if the cheeks are red, it indicates excess color; if the pulse is rapid and forceful, it indicates excess pulse; constipation with yellow urine, unquenchable thirst, rapid breathing, and heat in the legs all signify an excess condition. When these three signs of excess are present, cold and cooling medicines should be used to purge. There are seven situations wherein warm medicine should not be administered. Conversely, if the face appears pale, it indicates deficient color; if the pulse is weak and deep, it indicates deficient pulse; bluish stools, abdominal distention, spitting up milk, blue scleras, and coldness in the legs indicate deficiency.

In reality, for excess conditions, one drains, and for deficiency conditions, one supplements; all are methods and remedies to control disease. After taking medicine, if the illness has already diminished, one should not exceed the prescribed dosage. This aligns with the teachings from the \"Inner Canon\" which states that for severe toxicity, one should reduce the treatment by a third; for moderate toxicity, reduce by half; and for non-toxic conditions, reduce by seven tenths. The \"Inner Canon\" also states that when a condition is waning, one should wait for its recovery, meaning when the illness has diminished by half, one should stop the medication to allow the true vital energy to recover, supplemented by nourishing food to aid this recovery. It is said in a proverb that food supplements are preferable to medicinal supplements—a truth that coarse practitioners fail to understand. They attack cold with heat, causing internal heat to arise before the cold has dissipated; they counter heat with cold, allowing cold to set in before the heat has subsided. How can one expect recovery? The basis of premature death certainly starts here. These treatment principles are what I strictly adhere to in practice. When prescribing for children, one must choose only the finest remedies, for even the slightest toxic substance is unacceptable. If pathogenic energy has not been eliminated and vital energy is depleted, it is pitiful how fragile young sprouts cannot withstand frost. The \"fine\" refers to medicines that are mild, balanced, and non-toxic, while \"toxic\" refers to harsh and caustic medicines that may cause dizziness or impairment. Therefore, remedies for children should actually drain excess, such as those that clear the green bile, guide out the red bile, drain the white bile, or eliminate the yellow bile; if deficient, one should supplement, such as tranquilizing with substances like antler gelatin or rehmannia. Remedies that cool heat, regulate cold, treat convulsions, or nourish children to combat malnutrition are all gentle and non-toxic, and these are my family's secret formulas.

Mistaking the treatment for cold and heat can lead to excessive harm, while warming the middle and detoxifying can provide miraculous effects. According to Zhang Zhongjing's principles for treating cold damage: when one should not sweat but is made to sweat, it signifies a condition of rash with excessive sweating; this can lead to severe outcomes. When one should not be purged but is, this indicates ailments of abdominal fullness, pain, vomiting, and uncontrollable diarrhea; excessive purging can lead to dire consequences. When a child is ill, do not purge unless there is fever, sweating, or spontaneous diarrhea. Signs of distress include cold limbs, weak spirit, dry retching, and fear. Symptoms like vomiting roundworms, pale face, hair loss, failure to digest food, nasal congestion, coughing, and thin phlegm indicate a troubled pulse and anxiety. If there is accumulation of waste, it is genuinely alarming. If a child shows true heat, purging does no harm; they may have a flushed face, red eyes, and strong energy.

If the illness can be treated, one should care for the child as they would for their own. Nurturing and providing care must be thorough. There are three approaches: first, use vigorous methods to drive away the illness; one should not excessively attack while favoring supplements, as this will only aid the evil and harm the child. Second, apply a combination of vigorous and gentle methods; if the illness lingers, food intake must be limited, and the spleen and stomach weakened, so in spleen supplements, add medicinal ingredients to address the illness, adjusting according to the child’s strength.

When the child's head is raised on the left, use the right hand; when raised on the right, use the left hand. The index finger represents the upper area, the middle finger the middle area, and the ring finger the lower area. If all three fingers are hot, it indicates the invasion of wind pathogenic factors, with symptoms like nasal congestion, rough breathing, fever, and cough. If all three fingers are cold, it suggests external invasion and internal damage, with symptoms like fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. If the index and middle fingers are hot, it indicates heat above and cold below; if the middle finger is hot, it suggests a shock; if only the index finger is hot, it indicates fullness in the chest; if only the ring finger is hot, it suggests undigested milk or food.

Water-related fright indicates the lungs have received wind; the qi gate experiences wheezing and cough with accumulated phlegm.

During food-related diarrhea, it is essential to manage accumulations, and for cold diarrhea, warming the spleen is necessary. For watery diarrhea, focus on draining excess from the organs. If a child suddenly cries out without reason, it may not be due to wind but rather a celestial disturbance.

The newborn is called an infant, a three-year-old is called a child, and a ten-year-old is called a youth. There are different sizes among children, and the severity of diseases varies among them. By observing their shape, color, voice, and pulse, if one can investigate these details carefully, they could be regarded as a skilled and wise practitioner. To observe is to discern appearance and color. For example, the left cheek corresponds to the liver, the right cheek to the lungs, the forehead to the heart, the nose to the spleen, and the chin to the kidneys. If there is liver disease, the face turns green; if lung disease, the face turns pale; if heart disease, the face turns red; if spleen disease, the face turns yellow; and if kidney disease, the face turns dark. This is knowledge derived from observation. To hear is to understand the condition through sound. For instance, with liver disease, the voice is mournful; with lung disease, the voice is hurried; with heart disease, the voice is strong; with spleen disease, the voice is slow; and with kidney disease, the voice is deep. These pertain to the organs. Additionally, if there is disease in the large intestine, the voice is prolonged; in the small intestine, the voice is short; in the stomach, the voice is quick; in the gallbladder, the voice is clear; and in the bladder, the voice is faint. This is knowledge derived from hearing. To inquire is to ask about the disease’s origins. For example, if a person craves sour food, they may have liver disease; if they crave spicy food, they may have lung disease; if they crave bitter food, they may have heart disease; if they crave sweet food, they may have spleen disease; if they crave salty food, they may have kidney disease; if they prefer hot food, they may have internal cold; and if they prefer cold food, they may have internal heat.

External symptoms of wind and cold are usually limited. When a child is still in the womb, if the mother is hungry, the child feels it; if the mother is full, the child feels it too.

Within sixty days after birth, the pupils form, allowing for smiling and recognition; by a hundred days, the meridians are complete, leading to the ability to turn and roll; at one hundred eighty days, the tailbone develops, enabling independent sitting; at two hundred ten days, the bones of the palm develop, allowing for crawling; at three hundred days, the kneecap forms, enabling standing; and at three hundred sixty days marks a full term, with the knee bones complete, allowing for walking. This is the norm. If it is not so, the body will not attain balance. There may be cases where a child cannot walk or stand by the ages of four or five, which indicates an insufficiency in the reception of fetal qi. If the muscles are strong, there will be greater strength; if the bones are solid, walking will occur earlier; if the blood is abundant, the body will be slender and have more hair; if the flesh is sufficient, there will be fewer illnesses. If the essence is adequate, the child will be lively, talkative, and resilient to cold and heat; if the qi is abundant, there will be less hair but a robust body. These indicate a sufficient reception of fetal qi. In general, the endowment should be moderate, with pure yin and yang, a balance of hardness and softness, harmony between qi and blood, complete spirit, and a strong physique. Before being fully developed, the skull should be well-formed and firm, the eyes bright and clear, the mouth rectangular with thick lips, bones sturdy and buttocks full, the navel deep and abdomen soft, the penis small and testes large, the teeth fine and hair glossy, the voice loud and sleep stable; these all reflect a balanced and harmonious reception of fetal qi.

Tongzhenzi mentions that both milk and food cause the child’s face to turn yellow and mouth to smell bad, and can also produce phlegm and cysts. If a mother sweats before nursing, it leads to heart damp and strong heat. Ge Hong explains that sweat is the liquid of the heart; if there is excessive sweating before nursing, it injures the heart.

The movements of the heart are influenced by external things. When affected by objects, the heart moves, hence it manifests in sound. Sounds respond to one another, thus generating changes. Human sickness is hidden within, but the voice reveals it externally. When music is chaotic, the five tones are disharmonious; when the human voice is chaotic, the five organs are disharmonious. Therefore, listening to sounds is a way to diagnose people's illnesses. The \"Plain Questions\" says: by observing breathing and listening to sounds, one knows the source of suffering. Thus, the \"Rites of Zhou\" states: use the five energies, five colors, and five sounds to observe life and death. The sage Sun said: when the five organs are disharmonious, the five sounds are out of tune, the five colors are uncertain, there certainly will be illness. The \"Three Causes Method\" says: observe the excess or deficiency of the five organs; the throat pertains to sounds, it maintains balance. When balanced, the energy is strong; when deficient, the energy is weak. Therefore, the voice is like coming from a room, indicating the sparseness of energy. If words are few, and only said once every day, it can deplete energy. Words, whether good or bad, do not avoid kinship or distance, thus disturbing the spirit and clarity. When the sounds do not follow one another in intent, yin and yang are lost.

He then purchased Shenqiong pills from a pharmacy, which caused his belly and abdomen to grow increasingly cold and painful, with the pain coming and going for over seven or eight years without relief. He remembered the ancient saying: \"To treat cold, one must use heat.\" To cure cold with heat is a principle that even skilled doctors should not abandon. The substance that harmed him was cold; the medicine he took was also cold. A heavy cold injures the stomach, which explains the cold disease he suffered from. Generally, a person's spleen and stomach prefer warmth and dislike cold. Moreover, a child's blood and qi are still weak, making him unable to withstand such cold. Hence, the Yang energy becomes concealed, and the cold poison lingers, remaining for a long time without removal. To treat an illness, one must first address its root cause; thus, one should use harmonizing and qi-nurturing medicine to remedy past mistakes. After taking the right medicine for a month, he finally healed. Alas! When Kongzi received medicine, he said he would not dare taste it until he understood it; this is crucial for preserving life. How could one simply remain silent and insist on feeling the pulse, believing they could identify the illness? The pulse reflects a person's blood and qi, flowing between the meridians: when heat prevails, the pulse is rapid; when cold prevails, the pulse is slow; when real, it is strong; when empty, it is weak. How could one distinguish what injured him merely by its shape? Physicians must carefully examine the source of the illness. Additionally, the father of this boy did not inform the doctor of the source of the illness but sought remedies in the marketplace, resulting in seven years of suffering, all because he overlooked this principle. Master Sun said: \"Before diagnosing, it is best to inquire first,\" which is very accurate. Dongpo said: \"If one only seeks to cure the illness, without considering the physician's burden.\" The words of these two sages greatly benefit the world. Children are harder to treat than adults."},{"anchor":"trans-130p","marker":"130p","type":"translation","text":"The way of medicine is indeed difficult. Therefore, treating children is particularly challenging. The revered Sun said: \"To be able to treat ten men is not as good as treating one woman.\" Why is that? Men are robust and vigorous, while women's blood and veins are complicated, especially with childbirth making treatment more difficult. The \"Thousand Golden Prescriptions\" states: \"Women's illnesses are ten times more difficult to treat than men's.\" It also says: \"To be able to treat ten women is not as good as treating one child.\" Why is that? Women can discuss their illnesses, their blood andqi are still intact; children cannot express themselves, their spirits are not fully developed, and pulse-taking is hard to rely on; thus, they are said to be difficult to treat. In ancient times, it was said that understanding from observing was called \"spiritual insight,\" and pediatricians are known as the \"dumb doctors.\" When examining, it is particularly important to observe color, so it is addressed first. When observing an infant's face, one must discern five colors to understand the source of illness. The human body has five parts, with the head being the foremost; within the head is the face, and within the face are the eyes, where illumination is found. The \"spirit\" refers to the brightness of the eyes, which can be seen through their clarity and reaction, corresponding to the five internal organs. The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. The colors of the five organs are as follows: the heart is red, the liver is blue, the spleen is yellow, the lungs are white, and the kidneys are black. The illnesses corresponding to the five organs are contained within and must manifest in outward appearance. Therefore, when a child is ill, one should first observe the color and shape of the main body to discuss the influences of the five elements regarding fortune and misfortune.

Specifically, this refers to infants who are unable to speak; if they are sick, there is no way to inquire about their suffering, hence the lack of recorded information. Those who can speak are able to communicate their conditions. Is it conceivable that a child over six years old cannot speak? The only ones who cannot speak are infants aged one or two. Thus, the ancients indicated that those who are unable to speak are very young. When ill, their skin is not fully developed, and it is difficult to distinguish their condition; symptoms may fluctuate and intertwine, with subtle energy and blood. Accurate diagnosis through palpation is indeed challenging. Hence, observing their physical appearance and correlating it with symptoms can reveal the source of the illness. The method of observation requires a calm demeanor and focused intention, avoiding distractions caused by emotions. One must not observe the child when they are crying or just waking up, as their appearance may be misleading. Ideally, observations should take place after the hour of Chen (7 AM - 9 AM) and before the hour of Si (1 PM - 3 PM), in summer when it’s not too hot, and in winter when it’s not too warm, ensuring that the external appearance is unclouded and internal energy is relaxed, making it suitable for clear observation. The \"Holy Wisdom Classic\" states: Knowledgeable individuals can discern the balance of strong and weak, brave and timid, observing their states of fullness and emptiness, and understanding the implications of cold and warmth, balancing yin and yang, determining the severity of illness and treatment urgency according to symptoms, so there's no need to struggle with difficult cases.

However, in my view, among the three, children are actually the easiest to treat. Why do I say this? It is because children's ailments, if not caused by external wind and cold, stem from internal issues such as dietary imbalance, leading to conditions like convulsions, vomiting, diarrhea, and various fevers; they are merely a few types. Moreover, children's organs are clear and responsive, and if one can correctly ascertain their fundamental issue and address it, a single medicine can cure them, unlike the chronic and stubborn ailments often found in men and women, which is why I deem it easy.

Once the six factors are clearly understood, how can treatment be difficult? Thus, for any external pathogen, there must be exterior symptoms without interior signs, such as fever, headache, tightness without sweating, or conditions similar to wind constriction.

If what one sees is not genuine, it is not advisable to hastily eliminate the symptoms, as it may also be harmless. It is important to realize that a child, with a delicate body and undeveloped energy and blood, has fragile organs; even slight injuries or impairments can lead to significant decline, and a mistake in treatment can be unbearable for them.

Generally, a clear and bright sound indicates life, while a muffled sound suggests illness, and silence indicates a lack of longevity. If a child suddenly cries out loudly without apparent illness, one must closely examine their body for potential sores or toxins, which should be treated immediately. If the umbilical cord has no blood, the child is likely alive; a silver-white cord indicates life. A short, swollen purple cord, after being cut, may be safe if the purple blood is pressed out. A wide forehead indicates longevity. A black and open sutural line suggests longevity. If a child is born resembling a water bubble, this is a bad sign. A face that is slightly yellow indicates good fortune. If born with a powdery white and floral appearance, it surely indicates death from umbilical wind. If born with loose skin and thin flesh, and then gains weight significantly after five or six days, this also suggests a risk of umbilical wind. If born with skin that is not smooth, the child will die. Crying without sound indicates death. Crying without tears indicates death. A tongue that resembles pig liver indicates death. Purple markings at the corners of the mouth resembling shrimp whiskers indicate death. Thick and long hair suggests life; fine and soft, non-releasing hair indicates death. If the male genitalia do not appear, the child will die. If the scrotum does not retract, or if it is white or red, the child will die. A child without an anal opening will die. [Note: There are cases today where this can be treated. The \"Ancient and Modern Medical Compendium\" records therapeutic methods, detailing medical cases related to fetal conditions. Medical practitioners should thoroughly investigate both internal and external treatments in such cases.] If the flesh on the buttocks does not develop, the child will die."},{"anchor":"trans-170p","marker":"170p","type":"translation","text":"Those whose flesh does not develop will not live long. Those with a pale face will die young. Those with a short and dark umbilical cord will die young. Those born entirely silver-white will die young. Those who are born with teeth are greatly ominous; they will injure their parents, and if not, they will harm themselves. Those who, without being wrapped, urinate immediately after birth will kill their parents and squander family wealth, living a life of toil and hardship. Regarding pulse diagnosis: When a child’s form is complete and meridians are fully developed, as soon as they are born, their pulse can be discerned. Thus, the discussion of deficiency and excess states: if an infant has a weak, suspended pulse and warm hands and feet, they will live; if cold, they will die. If an infant suffers from wind-heat and has wheezing and loud breathing, with a strong, large pulse, if it is slow, they will live; if rapid, they will die. This is the basis of Xuānqí’s diagnosis of children, which always emphasizes the pulse and combines it with symptom interpretation. In works such as the \"Water Mirror Classic\" and \"Complete Guide to Young Hearts,\" it is stated that for children above three years old, one should observe the pulse in relation to the Tiger Mouth (thumb), and the Yin (liver) and Chen (spleen) positions based on wind and vital conditions. Among these observations, it is stated that a pulse starting at the Yin position and not reaching the Mao position is easy to treat; if it connects to the Mao position, it is difficult to treat; if Yin invades Mao or Mao excessively invades Chen, the chance of saving them is one in ten. Such remarks should only be applied in critical situations to discern fortune and misfortune. Furthermore, different colors are associated with various ailments: purple indicates wind, red signifies febrile illness, green represents fright, white denotes malnutrition, and so on, including specific colors for various fright scenarios. However, can such simple color codes really distinguish these conditions accurately? This is the utmost folly—relying on such superficial observations is absurd."},{"anchor":"trans-171p","marker":"171p","type":"translation","text":"In today's pediatric examinations, there is seldom any method that does not rely on this framework; they do not understand the pulse and speak without any basis. If one were to inquire whether their hearts indeed possess any definitive insights, the answer would be uncertain, yet they wish to use children as subjects for experimentation, which is truly lamentable. Therefore, in diagnosing children, since their speech is unclear, it is all the more essential to prioritize the pulse, while also considering shape, color, and sound, ensuring a thorough approach. However, the pulse of children is not as varied as that of adults; one must observe the four aspects of strength, weakness, tension, and urgency in the pulse, as these are the key points for children. The strength and weakness can reveal vacuity and fullness, while tension and urgency can indicate the presence of evil or righteousness. Once these four aspects are clear, it matters not the various symptoms, but rather align the pulse with the illness and consider the causes behind these four aspects—this way, one will find an abundant source of knowledge and encounter truth in all cases. Further distinguishing with sound and color provides even more certainty; hence, how can one escape scrutiny? This is the most lively and ingenious method of thought. If one were to rely solely on a single pulse to determine a disease, the disease could still encompass various pulses, where the genuine and the false could intermingle, leading to a precarious conclusion that is hard to substantiate. Nevertheless, the method must not be discarded; one must carefully discern and choose those that possess sound reasoning."},{"anchor":"trans-172p","marker":"172p","type":"translation","text":"**Sound** Sound is produced by breath; when breath is robust, the sound is strong, and when breath is weak, the sound is timid.

Hua Yuanhua says: the yang state is often talkative, while the yin condition is silent; those who talk a lot are easier to treat, while the silent are difficult to nourish.

For women, the right side signifies rebellion, the left side signifies compliance; for men, the left side signifies rebellion, the right side signifies compliance. The piece on the five colors states: How do the five colors relate to the organs? It is said that blue and black indicate pain, yellow and red indicate heat, and white indicates cold; these are known as the five organs. Furthermore, when discussing illness in relation to color, the answer is: If the color is dull and bright, it indicates severity; if a certain color rises, the illness increases; if the color descends like clouds dispersing, the illness is easing. The piece on the channels states: In diagnosing the channels, if the pulse is blue, it indicates cold and pain; if red, it indicates heat. If there is cold in the stomach, the network at the base of the hand will often be blue. If there is heat in the stomach, the network at the base of the hand will be red.

Blue signifies wind energy, relates to liver disorders, and reflects the Yin deficiency of the spleen and kidneys, leads to abdominal pain, may indicate sudden fright affecting the heart and gallbladder energy, and suggests a possibility of convulsive states; one should examine the combined colors to differentiate between acute and chronic conditions. White signifies energy deficiency, and in serious cases, energy collapse. It represents an absence of fire and indicates insufficiency of the spleen and lungs. White with blue indicates chronic fright and issues related to diarrhea affecting the large and small intestines. Red signifies fire, phlegm heat, and conditions of exogenous heat causing signs of disturbance, thirst, irritability, obstruction, and Yang disorder related to shortness of breath, as well as indications of sores, ulcers, and rashes. Black is associated with water, indicating coldness and Yin energy, showing reversal of flow and extreme pain. Deep black indicates a critical condition. Yellow signifies accumulation, masses, spleen disorders, distension, and splenic ailments. Yellow accompanied by white suggests cold and weakness of the spleen, indicative of energy deficiency and lack of spirit. Yellow with blue indicates deficiency causing diarrhea and chronic spleen wind; yellow with red relates to heat in the spleen.

Therefore, those who practice medicine must first observe the innate qualities of the parents, with a particular emphasis on the mother's condition. If the mother has a lot of internal heat, the child will likely have heat-related issues; if the mother is cold, the child may have cold-related problems; if the mother’s spleen and kidneys are deficient, the child will exhibit similar deficiencies. Common symptoms such as soft bones, delayed walking, late teething, slow speech, a wide fontanel, malnutrition, and diarrhea often stem from the mother's condition. Although both parents contribute to the child's traits, the mother's influence is more immediate, while the father's is more distant. If one parent is strong and the other weak, it can lead to an imbalance in the child's qualities, which must be carefully considered. As the child grows, if they indulge excessively or if their upbringing is improper, they may develop health issues; thus, it is essential to investigate the causes and address them appropriately. If there is a deficiency in innate vitality, nurturing later development is vital for longevity. Even if both parents are robust, excessive desires or inadequate care can lead to a variety of ailments, and even a seemingly strong child can face early death.

Beyond this, if there are no sudden excessive symptoms, but the child is pale, undernourished, or showing signs of mild fever, diarrhea, exhaustion, etc., this is due to the insufficiency of the spleen and kidneys, leading to weak blood and energy. When pediatricians observe these signs, they often simply identify it as food accumulation and phlegm heat, tending to focus solely on purging and clearing, and excessively using cooling treatments, which gradually deplete the original vitality.

Thus, dietary habits should be carefully adjusted, and the use of medicines must be particularly cautious. Nowadays, pediatric practitioners, lacking knowledge of this fundamental principle and having no clear understanding, only seek immediate results. Consequently, when a child becomes ill, regardless of whether the condition is due to deficiency or excess, cold or heat, they resort to recipes that primarily aim to dispel wind, eliminate food stagnation, clear phlegm, and lower fire, all consisting of over twenty ingredients. This approach is mixed together and misrepresented as reliable, which is absurd. If a child has a certain ailment and is treated with these medicines, their illness will be exacerbated; if there is no ailment, then their vital energy will be harmed. Given that children's vital energy is limited, how can they avoid damage that leads to unpredictable changes? This misunderstanding represents a grave issue in contemporary pediatrics, highlighting the danger of careless treatment. Moreover, there are those who care for their children and, noticing them looking pale, thin, or weak, grow concerned. They consult common practitioners, who, instead of diagnosing phlegm or fire, hastily attribute it to food accumulation and recommend the constant use of products like Fat Child Pills or Baohe Pills. Little do they realize that Fat Child Pills, composed of bitter and cold ingredients, severely damage the original yang; while Baohe Pills, designed for expulsion, drastically deplete stomach energy.

As he grew older, he became completely ignorant, a mere simpleton; could this not be due to the damage to his vital essence? Such powerful medicines must be used with great caution. Therefore, they should only be used for genuine conditions: real heat and deficiency of the body warrant the use of Feier pill and cold remedies; genuine food stagnation requires the Baohuo pill and digestive aids; true phlegmatic heat with shortness of breath calls for the Baolong pill and phlegm dissolvers. Even when using these, one should merely address the immediate illness; they cannot be used excessively. If there is no actual pathogen to grapple with, and one observes various symptoms, they often stem from a loss of vital energy. In such cases, one should focus on nurturing and replenishing, as this is the true way to preserve vitality. If one is unaware of this and simply uses remedies like Feier and Baohuo for protection, oblivious to the fact that a child has limited vital energy and is already weakened by illness, then the physician’s actions would only further damage it, resulting in very few not withering away.

Now, I will transmit a method for all future children to attain longevity. The method involves first observing the complexion, then checking the pulse. When a child is ill, the complexion must be vivid. One can discern it by examining the point above the nose and between the eyes, at the center. If the complexion is red, it indicates heart heat; if red veins are visibly straight across the bridge of the nose, it further confirms heart heat. A purple complexion suggests severe heart heat, with lung heat also present. A green complexion indicates liver wind; if green veins appear straight, it signifies liver heat; if they are horizontal, it also indicates liver heat; the straight ones suggest rising wind, while the horizontal ones suggest descending wind. If the complexion is black, it indicates severe wind with cold in the kidneys. A white complexion indicates phlegm in the lungs. A yellow complexion suggests deficiencies in the spleen and stomach leading to diarrhea; yellow veins visible across the bridge of the nose, regardless of being horizontal or straight, are all signs of spleen and stomach issues. These are the only few colors relevant, thus one can determine the child's illness at a glance. For adults, pulses are checked at the cun, guan, and chi positions; the same applies to children but they don’t require checking all three. It suffices to observe whether there is a pulse or not. A vibrant pulse indicates heat, while an absent pulse indicates cold. Among those that are present, a floating pulse suggests wind, a sinking pulse suggests cold, a slow pulse suggests dampness, a taut pulse suggests evil qi, and a slippery pulse suggests phlegm; this is all.
