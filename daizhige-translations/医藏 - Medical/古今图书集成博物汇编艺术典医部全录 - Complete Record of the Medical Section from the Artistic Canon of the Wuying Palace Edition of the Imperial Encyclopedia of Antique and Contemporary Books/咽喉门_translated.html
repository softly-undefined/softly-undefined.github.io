      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p><strong>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books: Volume 160</strong></p>
<p><strong>Throat Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Taiyin and Yangming</strong></p>
<p>The throat governs the atmospheric qi, and the pharynx governs the earthly qi.<br><em>[Note: The throat is the gate of Taiyin&#39;s respiration, governing qi and belonging to heaven. The pharynx is the pathway of Yangming&#39;s essence, belonging to the stomach and governing the earth.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The combination of one yin and one yang is called throat obstruction.<br><em>[Note: One yin and one yang refer to Jueyin and Shaoyang. Jueyin wood governs qi and is transformed by the fire of Shaoyang; when wind and fire qi combine, the metal qi gets harmed, causing pain and obstruction in the throat.]</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Key Signs in Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>For those with the Yangming pattern, there is internal heat and dryness of the throat, frequent urination, and irritability. In severe cases, the tongue may curl up or the testicles may retract and end its function.<br><em>Annotation: The hand jueyin (pericardium) and foot jueyin (liver) are involved. The excess of wood and fire qi leads to internal heat and dryness of the throat, resulting in liver qi descending. Irritability indicates the elevation of pericardium qi. The liver is associated with tendons; tendons are concentrated in the genitals and connect to the root of the tongue, leading to symptoms such as a curling tongue and retraction of the sac.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>In cases of heart coughing, coughing results in heart pain, and the throat feels obstructed like a block; in severe instances, there may be swelling of the throat and pharyngeal obstruction.<br><em>Annotation: The throat is an orifice of the lungs. The heart fire consumes metal, hence the throat feels obstructed. The hand shaoyin (heart) meridian starts in the heart and connects to the throat, leading to symptoms of swelling and pain in the throat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>When someone suffers from wind in the spring, it is considered liver wind. Symptoms of liver wind include excessive sweating, sensitivity to wind, frequent sadness, a pale complexion, throat dryness, and irritability, with an occasional dislike for women; diagnosis may reveal a bluish hue below the eyes.<br><em>Annotation: The pulse of the foot jueyin circulates behind the throat and ascends to the jaw. When the wind from wood combines as a pathogen, it leads to excessive heat and dryness of the throat. Liver qi disorders cause irritability. Anger outweighs contemplation, resulting in occasional disdain for women. The eyes are associated with the liver, hence the examination reveals signs below the eyes.</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>Discourse on Counterflow</h3>
<p>Counterflow of the hand-Yangming and hand-Shaoyang causes throat numbness, swelling of the throat, and difficulties in swallowing, which are ailments treated by the main physician. [Note: Hand-Yangming refers to the Lung&#39;s bowels, while hand-Shaoyang refers to the Sanjiao. Yangming governs the throat, the Lung governs the voice, and the fire energy of the Sanjiao is in counterflow, leading to throat numbness and swelling. Yangming is a channel of dryness and heat, while Sanjiao is associated with the heat of dragon and thunder; the combined heat in counterflow causes difficulties in swallowing.]</p>
<h3>Explanation of Pulses</h3>
<p>In the case of Jueyin, if there is severe throat dryness and internal heat, it is because Yin and Yang are deficient, leading to heat. [Note: &quot;Severe&quot; indicates excessive Yang energy. The energy of Jueyin is diminished by excessive Yang, thus also making Yin hot, resulting in severe dryness and internal heat.]</p>
<h3>Major Discourse on the Six Fundamental Principles</h3>
<p>Shao Yang governs the heavenly authority; the three energies lead to common illnesses of internal heat, such as deafness, blurred vision, blood overflow from sores, coughing and vomiting, nasal bleeding, thirst, yawning, throat numbness, red eyes, and a susceptibility to sudden death. [Note: The ailments of the people suffering from internal heat are due to the influence of wind and fire energy. The intersection of the two fires and the arrival of wind heat cause the susceptibility to sudden death.] The golden-tinged symptoms lead to coughing up counterflow, fullness in the chest and ribs radiating to the lower abdomen, leading to sharp pain that cannot be countered or turned; dryness in the throat, a dusty face, and a ghastly complexion. [Note: Counterflow of coughing and dryness are ailments of the Lung.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>When the lesser yang arrives, it causes throat obstruction, tinnitus, and vomiting. </p>
<p>In the Year of the Great Yin, when dampness prevails, the people suffer from water retention, heart pain, deafness, and a swollen throat. </p>
<p>In the Year of the Lesser Yang, when dryness prevails, it may lead to a dry throat, dusty complexion, lack of bodily moisture, and external heat in the feet. </p>
<p>In the Year of the Greater Yang, when cold prevails, the people suffer from throat pain and swollen jaw. </p>
<p>When the Lesser Yang governs the heavens, and dryness prevails, the people suffer from a dry throat and dusty complexion.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Dry throat and dusty face are diseases of the liver meridian. When the sun governs, the cold prevails, causing people to suffer from a red face and yellow eyes, often accompanied by a dry throat. </p>
<p>(Note: The various symptoms arise from cold invading the heart fire, forcing it upwards, leading to a competition of water, fire, and heat.) </p>
<p>When the taiyin prevails, internal fire becomes stagnant, resulting in severe headaches and throat stiffness. </p>
<p>(Note: This is due to the mingling of wind and fire with dampness, ascending from the neck to the crown.) </p>
<p>When the yangming prevails, clarity emanates from within, causing throat obstruction. A great chill brings deathly stillness, leading to discomfort in the chest, throat obstruction, and coughing. </p>
<p>(Note: The cold and austere metal energy causes clarity to rise and results in throat obstruction and chest discomfort. Throat obstruction and coughing occur when the dryness of yangming metal rises to affect the lungs, creating mutual resonance.) </p>
<p>When the shaoyang governs, if external factors prevail, it leads to throat obstruction, headaches, throat swelling, and ear deafness. </p>
<p>(Note: All these are attributable to the invasion of damp heat causing illness.)<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>When the Yangming governs the heavens and the excess of clear and pure energy remains internally, there will be coughing, nosebleeds, and throat obstruction. </p>
<p>(Note: The excess of clear energy refers to the influx of pure and clean external energy into the body, resulting in a surplus. Coughing, nosebleeds, and throat obstruction are all ailments related to the lungs. The lungs are associated with metal and govern the heavens; therefore, the Yangming governing the heavenly energy may lead to illness in the lungs due to this internal excess.)</p>
<p>When the Taiyang governs the heavens and is dominant, there will be a sound in the throat. </p>
<p>(Note: This occurs due to the cold water energy below, which is expelled upwards from the lungs.)</p>
<p>One Yin and one Yang alternate and cease; this Yin energy reaches the heart, with no constancy in ascending or descending. The throat and esophagus become dry, resulting in illness in the earth and spleen.</p>
<p>(Note: One Yin refers to Jueyin, and one Yang refers to Shaoyang. If the energies of one Yin and one Yang alternate and cease, water cannot rise accordingly, leading to stagnant Yin energy that remains below the heart. The absence of constancy in ascending or descending indicates variability. The belly remains harmonized, and easy defecation indicates that water cannot adequately circulate through the limbs, causing difficulty in urination. If water cannot ascend and interact with the lungs, the throat and esophagus become dry. If it cannot nourish the central earth, then the earth becomes dry, leading to spleen sickness.)</p>
<p>From the &quot;Spiritual Pivot Classic&quot;</p>
<p>In the chapter on the manifestations of pathogenic energy affecting the organs, </p>
<p>The heart pulse is greatly disturbed, resulting in throat sounds. </p>
<p>(Note: The throat sounds refer to a resonant noise in the throat. The gathering of vital energy accumulates in the chest and arises to the throat, connecting the heart pulse to facilitate breathing. When heart energy is abundant, it produces sound in the throat.)<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Meridian Section</strong></p>
<p>The kidney&#39;s lesser yin meridian, when ill, presents symptoms of a hot mouth, dry tongue, swollen throat with difficulty in breathing, and dryness and pain in the throat. The triple warmer&#39;s lesser yang meridian, when moved, results in throat swelling and muscle lock. The small intestine&#39;s greater yang meridian, when moved, causes throat pain.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> These are ailments corresponding to the parts along the meridians.</p>
<p><strong>Organ Section</strong></p>
<p>When the lung is enlarged, it results in excessive thirst and is prone to chest tightness and throat obstruction with reversed qi. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lung is located in the chest, opening to the throat, and governs respiration; thus, when enlarged, it causes such ailments.</p>
<p><strong>Worry and Anger Without Words Section</strong></p>
<p>The throat is the passage for food and water. The larynx is the conduit for the upward and downward movement of qi. The epiglottis is the door to sound. The lips are like the fan of sound. The tongue is the instrument for sound. The uvula acts as a barrier for sound. The pharynx is where the control of qi is released. The horizontal bone governs the divine qi that directs the tongue&#39;s movement. If a person&#39;s nasal passages produce mucus and do not recover, the pharynx is obstructed, causing a loss of controlled qi. Hence, if the epiglottis is small and thin, it releases qi easily; its opening and closing are efficient, leading to a smooth outflow of qi. If the epiglottis is large and thick, its opening and closing are difficult, causing sluggish qi release and heavy speech. If a person suddenly loses their voice, it means cold qi has invaded the epiglottis, preventing it from producing sound; when sound cannot descend, complete closure and opening do not occur, therefore resulting in silence.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The upper passage of the stomach is the throat, which is responsible for the intake of food and drink; it lies behind the throat. The upper passage of the lungs is the throat, which governs the inhalation and exhalation of breath; it is located in front of the pharynx. The epiglottis is situated above the pharynx and is the junction of the throat; when a person eats or drinks, the epiglottis covers the throat, allowing the food to enter the pharynx. Thus, the throat&#39;s upper passage serves as the doorway for sound, from which vocal energy emanates. The mouth opens and closes to produce speech; hence it is called &quot;shàn&quot; (fan). The tongue must move to articulate speech, which is why it is referred to as &quot;jī&quot; (mechanism). The uvula is the soft palate between the throat, from which sounds emerge, thus referred to as &quot;guān&quot; (gate). The pharynx, known as &quot;pángcè,&quot; is the upper opening of the palate, through which breath, mucus, and saliva communicate; hence it is called the place where breath divides, as breath is expelled from the mouth and nose through it. The horizontal bone at the base of the tongue is where spirit and energy circulate; therefore, it is the primary control for articulating the tongue. The nasal cavity expels mucus and saliva without retention; if the pharynx does not open, the division of breath is lost. The opening and closing of the epiglottis govern the emission of sound and breath; consequently, if it is thin, sound is produced rapidly, but if it is thick, opening and closing becomes difficult, and breath escapes slowly, hence speech becomes heavy. The proper energy of the Lesser Yin rises, and only then does the sound manifest; if cold energy lingers in the epiglottis, it cannot produce sound; thus it cannot open. If the sound cannot descend, it means it cannot close. Therefore, if opening and closing do not occur, there will be no sound produced.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Boils and Abscesses Section</strong></p>
<p>Boils arise in the throat, known as &quot;severe abscess.&quot; If severe abscess is not treated, it turns into pus; if the pus does not drain, it blocks the throat and can lead to death within half a day. For those that turn into pus and drain, it is advisable to consume pig fat and cold food, which is sufficient for three days. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The throat is the gateway for breathing in and out; when it arises in the throat, its force is very fierce, hence the name &quot;severe abscess.&quot; If the pus does not drain and blocks the throat, breathing becomes obstructed and death can occur even before half a day. The throat is the upper passageway of the lungs, and the lungs and kidneys are interconnected; pig fat and cold drinks help expel the heat toxin from below.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Jin Kui Yao Lue</strong> (Essentials from the Golden Coffer) by Zhang Ji from the Han Dynasty</p>
<p><strong>Dryness</strong></p>
<p>The disease of fox spirit resembles a cold. One feels a silent desire to sleep but cannot close the eyes, restless in both lying down and sitting up. It corrodes the throat as &#39;spirit,&#39; and the lower body as &#39;fox.&#39; There is no desire to eat or drink, and one finds the smell of food repulsive. The face may suddenly appear red, black, or white. If it affects the upper body, the voice becomes hoarse; for this, the prescription is Gan Cao Xie Xin Tang. If it affects the lower body, the throat feels dry, and Ku Shen Tang is used to wash it away.</p>
<p>For symptoms of weakness and internal urgency, palpitations, nosebleeds, abdominal pain, dreams of loss of essence, aching limbs, hands and feet feeling hot and bothered, dry throat, and dry mouth, Xiao Jian Zhong Tang is indicated. </p>
<p>For coughing that resists the direction, how can one discern that this is lung abscess? There will be pus and blood; if vomited, it causes death. What type of pulse is this? The master says: the pulse at the inch is weak and rapid. Weakness indicates wind, and rapidity indicates heat; weakness leads to sweating, while rapidity causes aversion to cold. Wind harms the protective layer, causing breathing issues; heat overburdens the nutritive layer, leading to difficulty in exhalation. Wind injures the skin and hair, while heat damages the blood vessels; wind housed in the lungs causes coughing. </p>
<p>The person has a dry mouth and labored breathing, a dry throat without thirst, excessive salivation with muddy foam, and frequently feels chills. The places passed through by heat cause blood to stagnate, leading to the accumulation of pus and abscesses, resulting in vomiting resembling rice porridge. If the condition is in the early stages, it can be treated; once pus forms, it leads to death.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Coughing with a feeling of fullness in the chest, quick pulse, dry throat without thirst, occasionally producing foul-smelling phlegm, and after a long time spitting pus like rice porridge indicates lung abscess, treated with Jie Geng Decoction. </p>
<p>If the patient suffers from watery swelling in the face, body, and limbs, with difficulty in urination, the pulse not indicating water but rather pain in the chest, the qi surging upwards into the throat, resembling roasted meat, with slight cough and shortness of breath. In accordance with the master&#39;s explanation, what kind of pulse is it? The master says: the pulse at the cun-kou is deep and tight. Deep indicates water, tight indicates cold. Deep and tight impinge upon each other, causing a blockage at the lower abdomen&#39;s gate. Initially slight, but heightened over time unnoticed. After yang declines, the nourishing and protecting energies interfere with each other. Yang damage leads to an excess of yin, causing cold to constrict slightly, kidneys&#39; qi surging upwards, throat and pharynx becoming obstructed, and sudden sharp pain in the sides. If treated by retaining fluids and purging heavily, the qi fails to disperse, and the illness does not resolve. Later, heavy vomiting occurs, leaving the stomach weak and agitated, dry throat craving water, difficulty in urination, water and food undigested, and swelling in the face, hands, and feet. Moreover, administering Ting Li Pill to purge fluids, initially there may be slight relief, but excessive eating and drinking will cause swelling to return as before, with painful anguish in the chest and sides, resembling a wild dog. If water overflows, it leads to floating cough, panting, and counterflow of qi; one must first target the counterflow qi, allowing it to settle before treating the cough, as resolving the cough will subsequently alleviate the panting. First treat the new illness; the former illness will be addressed later.</p>
<p>Counterflow qi is ineffective.</p>
<p>Great counterflow qi surges upwards, with throat and esophagus having difficulty. To stop counterflow and promote downward qi, Mai Men Dong Decoction is prescribed.</p>
<p>When coughing with upward qi and a water hen sound in the throat, She Gan Ma Huang Decoction is prescribed.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Bi Pain</strong></p>
<p>The disease caused by Yang toxicity presents as a red, spotted face like brocade, with throat pain and purulent blood in saliva. It can be treated within five days; after seven days, it is untreatable. The treatment is prescribed with Shengma Bieqiao Decoction.<br>The disease caused by Yin toxicity presents with a blue face, body pain as if beaten, and throat pain. It can also be treated within five days; after seven days, it is untreatable. The treatment is Shengma Bieqiao Decoction, removing arsenic and Sichuan pepper.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Criterion</strong> (Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe)</p>
<p><strong>Dryness</strong></p>
<p>When all three levels are floating, there is wind in the lungs, with copious nasal discharge and thick saliva. There is fever, aversion to cold, and pain in the flesh; the throat is dry, and the eyes weep with sour pain. The lung pulse is both floating and solid, the throat is dry and injured. Bowel movements are difficult and constipated, with the nose lacking fragrance. When solid and large, it is combined with slickness; the fur is burnt and the tears and saliva are sticky. Additionally, dryness in the throat is increased; in autumn, one should use acupressure in summer.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Treatise</strong> (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</p>
<p>The throat corresponds to the spleen and stomach. It weighs twelve taels, is one foot two inches long, and two inches wide. Its circumference is twelve times, corresponding to the twelve hours. It governs the pathways of water and grains, facilitating spirit and qi. If there is internal heat, the throat will swell and block qi. Yujin ointment alleviates this. If there is cold in the organs, the throat will feel obstructed as if there is something stuck, with a constant urge to choke and a feeling of itchiness and phlegm. If there is heat, it should be opened; if cold, it should be unblocked. If it is neither hot nor cold, it should be adjusted according to the organs.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers</strong><br><strong>by Jin Dou Hanqing</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>Dou Menglin said: The throat is the crucial pathway for the essence of food and drink. The lung and large intestine are interconnected; the lung opens above to the throat, while the large intestine allows for the passage below. When food enters, life flourishes; when it ceases, life ends. Between life and death, changes in symptoms are diverse. Only the lung, governed by metal, regulates qi and generates bodily fluids, nourishing the entire body and moistening every bone. The cycle of life continues indefinitely, and when it flows smoothly, the five organs thrive and all passages are clear. However, if the dryness of metal is afflicted by the fire&#39;s invasion, it manifests swiftly, indicating a solar disorder. Thus, we treat by resolving heat and eliminating toxins, expelling wind and harmonizing qi, thereby restoring balance to metal. Danxi advised using rice vinegar to stir in the mouth to expel phlegm, which signifies alleviation. I believe excessive sourness causes dryness. First, use a bit of yellow ginger juice, add a little powdered Yuanming, and irrigate the throat to draw out phlegm; secondly, use vinegar water, adding more Yuanming powder to irrigate; finally, use honeyed water to moisten it. Gradually, phlegm can be expelled, thus opening the throat effectively. Additionally, using borneol powder for nourishment yields universally effective results.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>If the wind obstructs the throat and the three initial medicines fail to expel phlegm, it is advisable to use raw tung oil to flush it, stirring with a goose feather, then use honeyed water to moisten it. Urgently take Niuhuang Qingxin Wan or Puo Tan Wan to descend the phlegm. Subsequently, take Erchen Decoction with adjustments; there is no case that does not heal. If the voice from the throat sounds like thunder, with anxiety from eating and swelling in the eyes, if the Tianzhu point is depressed, and the face is dark with lips scorched, the nose devoid of breath, eyes protruding, and sweating like beads, this indicates death. If it extends to the neck, the head and face become swollen, red like fire, and medicines cannot treat it, urgently use a magnetic needle to expel the bad blood. Use chicken egg white mixed with frankincense powder for immediate healing. Then use banana root juice to soothe the toxins. If the mouth and tongue are swollen and purplish-black, urgently prick to release blood. Blowing herbal powder afterward is highly effective, thus making this clear. </p>
<p>Breathing entails expelling yang and inhaling yin. During the intervals of breathing, the lungs govern it. Below the throat, if we speak of the six organs, it refers to the yin of the limbs; below the oropharynx, regarding the six bowels, it refers to the yang of the limbs. The organs are associated with yin as the internal, while the bowels are associated with yang as the external. Organs hide and store; they are where the spirits flow and circulate; bowels are repositories, governing the intake and distribution of food and essence. Below the throat, the six organs relate to the throat&#39;s response to the natural world; thus, they are connected to the lungs. Since lungs belong to metal and autumn represents heaven, and autumn&#39;s metal is thus, the path of natural phenomena allows for the unobstructed flow of breath.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The throat and the pharynx run parallel; they are actually two distinct parts, yet many people are confused about them. The throat serves as the air passage, while the pharynx is where food and water pass through, and the throat connects to the qi of the lungs below. It is said that the throat contains three orifices; this is incorrect. If the throat had three orifices, then food and qi would each pass through a separate orifice into the lungs, but since the lungs have no orifice below, how could they convey food and water to the lower energizers? The writings of the Yellow Emperor state: The lungs are the crown of the viscera, storing the true high qi within the lung meridian. Hence, clear yang emerges from the upper orifices, while turbid yin exits from the lower orifices. If people in the world do not know how to maintain themselves, the six qi of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and heat, along with the seven emotions of joy, anger, worry, thought, grief, fear, and shock, can lead to ailments as a result of mismanagement and overexertion, causing a hundred diseases to arise. Once diseases like sore throat, chronic cough, throat sores, and throat closure due to wind, toxins, or heat develop, one must seek their origin. When faced with these conditions—throat constriction, phlegm accumulation, or throat inflammation—appropriate measures should be taken, but one must not act indiscriminately; when there is a need to purge, one should do so appropriately, and should not treat rashly. Such conditions pertain to the very foundation of life and death; without recognizing their roots and branches, attacking them recklessly will lead to misfortune almost immediately. Danxi noted: The throat and pharynx are essential for the entire body, connecting with the stomach and serving as the exit of breath. If heat and toxins accumulate in the chest, they can generate wind phlegm, leading to stagnation and resulting in throat diseases.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Sores develop in the throat, sometimes resembling flesh, with red swelling causing obstruction and making it difficult to swallow, leading to severe cases where a heavy tongue emerges. The primary treatment first aims to eliminate wind and phlegm to clear the throat and diaphragm, then to resolve the heat and toxins, as delays may lead to irretrievable conditions. Additionally, heat and toxins may surge to the palate and cause sores, known as &quot;suspended boils.&quot; Along with internal cold, this can also cause difficulty in swallowing and expectoration, hence a resolving method should be employed. Some say that treatment depends on the intensity of fire; if mild, treat directly; if severe, take countermeasures, inspect for phlegm and blood, and treat accordingly. Blood can be drawn at the lesser merchant point of the thumb to circulate qi. For those conditions that reach the exterior, external application of medication is essential. I have previously dipped a goose feather in rice vinegar to extract phlegm from the throat, as the acidity can help consolidate phlegm and disperse stagnant blood. If there are moths that do not disperse, use a small knife to draw blood just off the moth and apply powdered lead carbonate to the throat to dispel heat evils; take herbs such as changshan, indigo, licorice, platycodon, scutellaria, gardenia, rhubarb, and alum, adjusting the formula according to the symptoms to clear heat from the upper burner. Externally, herbs such as raw rehmannia, dragon liver, and leek roots can be used. If there are sores in the throat, whether white or red and often with bleeding, this is largely due to phlegm heat. First expel it with tung oil, then use licorice decoction to resolve the qi of the tung oil.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The affliction known as &quot;choking wind&quot; is associated with phlegm heat; when both the inner and outer throat are swollen, this is the condition. If there is no swelling externally, the body will be warm and the face red, indicating an extreme presence of heat and toxins. When there is swelling externally, the body is also warm, which is the result of the evils of fire manifesting outwardly. Sometimes the jaw is not strong, and there is no external swelling, but the throat is red, which indicates sudden sensitivity, and heat is present in the heart. If the affliction shifts from the left side to the right side, this is due to the lingering toxins not having left the body.</p>
<p>The throat can present various conditions: there may be accumulated heat, wind heat, pathogenic heat, or residual toxins after an illness, causing changes resembling a double-breasted moth. For example, if the throat is swollen and red for several days, shining like a mirror, this indicates accumulated heat. If the throat is swollen, slightly white, and shaped like an arm, this is due to wind toxin throat obstruction; this occurs when heat toxins encounter wind and fight against each other. If there is swelling in the throat with a purplish hue, this represents pathogenic heat, suggesting that the person is suffering from sudden exposure to heat toxins which congest the throat. It is essential to use herbs such as Mutong, Yuanshen, Shengdi, Huangqin, Huanglian, and Shanzhizi to clear the heart fire.</p>
<p>If one experiences shifting changes in the tongue, this indicates that heat has accumulated in the chest, hence the foul phlegm in the mouth. It is important to take cooling medications and apply treatments with borneol for support; one might also use a small (gold non-)knife to prick it to release purplish blood or toxins.</p>
<p>Why does throat obstruction cause swelling both internally and externally? This is due to the accumulation of wind and toxins in the throat, which results in congestion, stemming from a clash between wind toxins and phlegm. As stated in the &quot;Suwen&quot;: without wind, phlegm does not move; without phlegm, one is not affected by wind.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>When phlegm collides with wind, it blocks the throat. Externally, the throat appears about the size of an egg, slightly white in color, with swelling on the outside resembling sores. The body experiences chills and fever, the jaw is tightly clenched, and speech is not possible. First, use a mixture of water and pre-cooked flour or honey soup to extract the phlegm, and promptly take a decoction of Jingfang Disinfectant Powder. If there is swelling between the teeth that is purple-black, puncture it with a small knife and blow powdered borneol on it; this will be effective.</p>
<p>If the patient has a heavy tongue like a lotus flower, this indicates heat rising with wind, the fiery heart ascending. The treatment is the same as before. </p>
<p>If after recovery, the patient has a foul mouth and abdominal cramps, this is because heat toxins accumulate in the spleen; urgently use Suzi Jiangqi Decoction. </p>
<p>If after recovery, the patient has a dry, painful throat, this suggests the kidney&#39;s water is depleted, heart fire rushing upwards, consuming body fluids. First use ingredients like Ophiopogon, Schisandra, Ginseng, Apricot kernel, Asparagus, Licorice, Trillium, Rehmannia, Angelica, Platycodon, and Gardenia seeds, dissolve them in Shuangqing Pills.</p>
<p>If after recovery the patient experiences shortness of breath and cannot speak, it indicates the lung qi is obstructed; enhance Jiangqi Decoction with more Qianhu and add ginger juice at the time of administration. If the voice is hoarse or silent after illness, this signifies punishment of the lung meridian, and the outlook is grim.</p>
<p>If there is wind-heat closure of the throat, both internally and externally swollen, it means the person has long accumulated heat toxins and then contracted wind, resulting in wind and heat colliding and blocking the throat. This person also has a red face, swollen cheeks, experiences chills and fever, and has a lump in the throat the size of a fist, with fresh red blood externally.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>First, use jade-character honey to adjust the treatment, then apply a modified Jingfang disinfectant decoction. If the jaw is tightly locked and cannot open, this is due to wind-phlegm clashing and obstructing the throat. First, use a wooden needle to clear the blockage; apply juice from yellow vegetable, warm honey soup, or vinegar water, all mixed with Yuanming powder to wash down the throat. Then stir with a goose feather to expel several bowls of phlegm, and externally apply a mixture of five parts powder and vinegar. Quickly take the Jingfang Erchen decoction, followed by blowing in Bingsu powder.</p>
<p>If there is an ulcer in the throat with a yellow hue, probe for phlegm as before. Use a small knife to pierce the ulcer to release pus, then blow in Bingsu powder and take a mouse sticky herb detoxifying decoction.</p>
<p>If the throat is closed due to wind-heat, this results from the patient accumulating heat toxins over a long period, leading to wind exposure and the clash of wind and heat, manifesting outwardly. The treatment method remains the same.</p>
<p>If it’s due to virtual yang rising, resulting from chronic illness with weakened vital energy, causing evil fire to ascend, the throat becomes swollen and painful. There is a lack of balance between water and fire, and heart fire surges towards the throat, leading to swelling and obstruction. The signs include inability to speak, tightly locked jaws, a mouth full of phlegm, cold hands and feet, and dizziness. The treatment method is as mentioned before.</p>
<p>If the condition is severe, the patient may be unresponsive with wide-open eyes and staring gaze; grind fructus corni and mix it with vinegar to apply to the soles of the feet, then use a decoction to lower Qi. If there is shortness of breath, add Qianhu and Wuyao; if there is breathlessness, add Chenxiang and Ginseng. Once the hands and feet become warm, drink thin porridge to restore vital energy. Entering the valley leads to prosperity; if one leaves the valley, it leads to demise. This is what it means.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>If there is swelling around the jaw and red on the outside, this must be due to wind toxin. Urgently use紫苏 (perilla), maple leaves, and cypress branches to brew a soup and wash it. For external use, apply a potion of荆防 (aprl) and 羌活 (schizonepeta) to dispel the wind, or use 十宣散 (Ten Xuan Powder).</p>
<p>If the patient’s hands and feet are cold and the lips tremble, it is advisable to use小续命汤 (Small Revive Life Decoction), brewed with ginger and jujube, taken hot.</p>
<p>If the illness is localized to the right side, where residual toxins have not been removed, urgently take牛蒡子汤 (Burdock Seed Decoction) or a breath-reducing decoction with modifications for treatment.</p>
<p>If there is dryness in the mouth, night sweats causing insomnia, and occasional delirium with erratic movements, use十味人参散 (Ten Flavor Ginseng Powder) to treat it. The juice from地松 (pine) is also effective. Grind谷精草 (plantain) to a powder and blow it into the mouth; the juice from小青草 (small grass) is also beneficial. Mix雄黄 (realgar),元明粉 (calomel), and白矾 (alum) into a powder and blow it to induce expectoration.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>In cases where one cannot sleep at night after an illness, with a lack of bodily fluids, treat with apricot-jujube paste or ginseng and sour jujube seed decoction. </p>
<p>In cases where the yang energy is weak and ascending, with no balance of water and fire, lower back cold without pain or itching, excessive phlegm in the mouth, and darkened lips, do not treat. </p>
<p>In cases where the mouth is red, there is bloody vomiting, and accompanied by phlegm and wheezing with a bluish face, do not treat. </p>
<p>In cases where the hands and feet are cold, the voice is inaudible, and there is a dry, painful throat without swelling, do not treat. </p>
<p>In cases where the hands and feet are cold and cannot retract, the neck is low and cannot rise, and there is dizziness with darkened vision, do not treat. </p>
<p>In cases where the tongue is rolled and cannot swallow, this is due to heat and toxicity rising; urgently use Zixue powder combined with musk to apply on the tongue, and then blow with Bingshi powder. </p>
<p>In cases of throat swelling and the reoccurrence of a heavy tongue, both of these channels are afflicted, indicating the presence of evil influences. Heart evil manifests under the tongue, and stomach evil emerges from the throat.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>If there is a malignancy in the throat that arises from the heart meridian, then both ailments will manifest simultaneously, with external symptoms including headache, stiff neck, and feverish body. The method for examining phlegm is the same as before; additionally, use Zixue and Bingpian powder for treatment. </p>
<p>If there are over ten days of contracted cold with post-illness agitation, sore throat, a curled tongue, and a shrunken appearance, it is untreatable. If after more than ten days the illness remains unresolved with transmission leading to sore throat, and external symptoms like blue lips and curled tongue appear, this condition belongs to the uterine meridian and is difficult to treat. A dry sore throat with no phlegm is untreatable. Sore throat with a curled lip is untreatable. Sore throat with sweating in the head is untreatable. A black mouth indicates difficulty in treatment. Nasal congestion is untreatable. </p>
<p>If there is swelling in the throat and sores on the tongue, this indicates heat affecting the heart. Prolonged heat in the heart can lead to closure of the throat, and residual toxins drying the heart can result in tongue sores. One should use Bingpian powder and modify the Yuantan Shengma decoction for treatment. Its form resembles that of the bayberry, hence it is called &quot;heavy palate.&quot; If there is closure of the throat due to alcohol poisoning, and the alcohol has impacted both the heart and spleen channels, leading to throat obstruction, the individual will have a flushed face and upward-looking eyes. The phlegm-extraction method remains the same, followed by the use of Bingpian powder for blowing and cooling drinks.</p>
<p>If suddenly there is swelling and enlargement in the mouth, it is known as &quot;flying ulcer,&quot; which can be fatal. Use a small knife to puncture for bleeding, and add moss to detoxify, along with safflower and peony root. Difficulty with nausea and abdominal bloating is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Generally, the treatment method is the same for men and women. However, if a woman has swelling in the throat that is red in color, this signifies menstrual irregularity.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If the meridians cannot function, it leads to blockages above, resulting in swelling and pain in the throat, attributed to disharmony between nourishment and defense. Men are primarily governed by qi, while women are primarily governed by blood. Each gender should adjust their treatment according to their specific qi and blood. It is advisable to use the Rong Decoction for this. If the condition is severe, with a pale complexion and cold feet, this indicates a deficiency of yang rising upwards; the appropriate treatment would be to take the Jiangqi Decoction, along with sputum-expectorant medicine as before. For pregnant women experiencing heart pain, do not treat. If the jaws are tightly locked and cannot open, with chest distress and a complete absence of qi, one may use ground soapberry to blow into the throat. If a woman experiences throat pain before childbirth and has a floating pulse, do not treat. If the face is red and the eyes are directed upward, do not treat. If the face is dark and there is sweating from the head, do not treat. If there is tightness in the heart and chest with inability to expel phlegm, do not treat. If there is diarrhea, do not treat.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>Shortness of breath with limbs cold and not treated. Heart distressed, chest very red, tongue rolled, face red, eyes looking upward - not treated. Blood and qi attacking the heart, wanting to collapse, face red - not treated. Self-benefit, wheezing - not treated. Cold limbs - not treated. Alternating fever and delirium - not treated. Chest and abdomen distended and urgent - not treated. Throat sometimes feels thunderous or chokes on food - not treated. If a woman has contracted the cold with fever and throat pain, this indicates the menstrual flow is rising. The &quot;Book of Living&quot; states: When a woman has contracted cold, if her menstrual period arrives, she is clear during the day, but delirious in the evening, as if seeing spirits – this indicates heat has entered the blood chamber, without harming the stomach qi and the upper two jiaos, and should not be purged. Xiao Chai Hu Tang is the remedy. Now, if there is throat pain and alternating fever, with a red face and red lips, this indicates heat evil is obstructing upward.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Do not use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction; instead, it is advisable to use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction to clear the upper jia and alleviate heart disturbances, which is quite effective. Following that, use Si Wu Decoction.</p>
<p>If a cold disease has persisted for four to five days with fever, dry nose, dry mouth, and sore throat, it indicates a disease of the Yangming channel. Yangming pertains to the stomach; excessive sweating can lead to the stomach&#39;s fluids drying up, which causes the saliva to dry and the throat to hurt. In this case, it is appropriate to use Ren Shen Bai Du San to treat it.</p>
<p>If the cold has lasted for three to five days and there is swelling in the throat that is bright red, with phlegm flowing out, as well as headache and stiff neck, this pertains to the Taiyang channel. The pathogenic qi has entered the meridians, affecting the heart, and the accumulated heat toxins attack the throat, resulting in swelling and pain. Add Burdock Seed, Original Ginseng, and Fresh Rehmannia to Gan Ju Decoction and administer the medicine in a similar manner.</p>
<p>If the cold has lasted for eight to nine days or more, with no heat present on the body, abdominal pain with diarrhea, and a sore throat, this indicates a disease of the Taiyin channel. If the cold has not been resolved after sweating and has shifted to Taiyin, and if there is fullness in the abdomen along with pain, diarrhea, and a swollen throat with a slightly pale color, this condition is treatable. If there is cold in the hands and feet, with persistent diarrhea, use Zhen Wu Decoction to treat it. The so-called Zhen Wu can nourish the lower source and support the Yang righteous qi, making the hands and feet warm, which is crucial. </p>
<p>The text states: &quot;As long as the mouth is red and there is phlegm, treatment is possible.&quot; It is essential to adjust the medication based on the symptoms. If the mouth is black, it indicates the blood is already exhausted, with a hoarse voice and sweating; such a condition is untreatable. Careful examination of the symptoms is necessary. </p>
<p>If the cold has lasted for eight to nine days or more, with sweating that has not dispersed, a sore throat, dry tongue, and dry lips, this indicates a disease of the Shaoyin channel.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>If the greater yin channel suffers from illness and, after sweating, it remains unresolved, it transmits into the lesser yin channel, which is associated with the kidneys. If there is excessive sweating, the kidney essence becomes depleted, and the kidney water is unable to moisten the throat, leading to this condition. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, coldness in the hands and feet, and swelling and pain in the throat making swallowing difficult. If there is a lack of saliva and dryness on the tongue, it is not to be treated.</p>
<p>If a patient has been ill for eight or nine days with slight warmth in the body but no other symptoms, only throat pain without swelling, and hoarseness of voice, it should not be treated.</p>
<p>If a cold has lasted for more than ten days, and after sweating the illness has resolved without tidal fever, with a calm pulse and throat pain, this indicates residual toxicity attacking upward, for which a detoxifying decoction should be used.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>If one is seriously affected by a severe illness, with symptoms such as a strong back, unbearable eye pain, urgent pain in the lower abdomen, a dark blue-black mouth, toxic qi overwhelming the heart, coldness in the limbs, nausea and vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and a deep, thin pulse, then prompt treatment should be administered by moxibustion below the navel. Recovery should occur within six days; otherwise, survival is unlikely. </p>
<p>In this case, external symptoms may resemble a snake coiling around the neck, with the body feeling hot and the head experiencing intense pain with swelling and discoloration. According to a comprehensive approach, the treatment should include blowing medicine with realgar and musk added. Taking Jing Fang Zhi Zi Er Chen Soup is necessary, along with urgent application of a goose feather dipped in thick oil from a lamp, stirring to remove phlegm until three to four bowls are cleared. If phlegm cannot be expelled, survival becomes difficult. It is essential to avoid wind. </p>
<p>Internal symptoms may present as red marks with white patches, showing obstruction and difficulty swallowing, all due to heat in the kidney channels, causing dryness and preventing moisture from rising, thus generating excessive heart fire and leading to this condition. One should take Bai Du San and employ the method of expelling vomit, continuing to use blowing medicine, repeating this three to five times. Additionally, the root of white pine should be crushed for its juice, used as a rinse to dispel wind-phlegm. If the throat opens producing a roaring sound, it is untreatable, and caution is advised.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Double Nipple Moth</strong></p>
<p>The throat divides into two pathways, each receiving different ailments. The left throat is soft and concerns swallowing; the right throat is for speaking. The classic text states: the throat can distribute air, and the pharynx can swallow things. Therefore, diseases in the throat are collectively referred to as pharynx and throat. Physicians can treat them separately. The symptoms vary in types and appearances, and it is essential to examine them carefully.</p>
<p>The Double Nipple Moth, also known as the Double Moth Wind, consists of two growths on either side of the throat, the size of beans. Quickly administer a little yellow juiced, honey, mixed with Yuanming powder, gargle to dispel wind and phlegm. Then, take a decoction of Angelica and Forsythia, seven pills of realgar to clear toxins, and wash down with clear tea. Next, use Borneol powder and blow it in several times for immediate effect. Afterwards, take the Angelica and Forsythia decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Single Nipple Moth</strong></p>
<p>When the left side is affected by rising yang, swelling appearing slightly red signifies a blockage of lung qi, with external symptoms such as coldness in the hands and feet, spontaneous phlegm and saliva, dizziness, and blurry vision. Quickly administer a sour juice of sour vegetables mixed with Yuanming powder to clear phlegm; then blow in Borneol powder and follow with a decoction of Perilla Seed to reduce qi, Erchen Decoction, and Sweet Orange Decoction. If there is severe obstruction leading to loss of consciousness and breath, urgently ground Evodia into a paste and apply it to the soles of the feet.</p>
<p>For the right side, if the rising yang is slightly yellow, the shape resembles a silkworm cocoon, hence called the Nipple Moth. Symptoms also include coldness in the hands and feet, treated similarly. If there is accompanying back pain, add dried ginger and red peony root.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Alcohol Poisoning</strong></p>
<p>Its shape resembles an egg, its swelling is bright red, its sheen like a mirror. Externally, it manifests as fever, aversion to cold, headaches, and stiffness in the neck. This indicates accumulated heat in the upper jiao, affecting the heart and spleen. The heart and spleen channels govern the upper jiao, so it is advisable to take a decoction of sticky seeds to counteract the poison, with the treatment remaining consistent. If the swelling is yellow, the blood is black, its shape resembles an arm, and the swelling appears like a pit, with external signs of a flushed face and upward gazing eyes, this indicates that heat poison is damaging the heart and spleen. The energies of the two channels connect to the mouth, circulating up and down, hence the sore throat. Treatment: first expel the phlegm, then use powdered ice to dry and blow into it, adding more dried ginger, tianhua powder, raw huanglian, gardenia fruit, forsythia, yuan shen, platycodon, and bitter orange to the mouse sticky seeds decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Poison</strong></p>
<p>Externally red and swollen, internally slightly red with white, its shape resembles a steamed cake, with swelling and pain extending to the jaw. External manifestations include aversion to cold without fever, swelling in the jaw and face, and a tight jaw, indicating a clash of wind and phlegm obstructing the throat. The primary treatment must focus on expelling phlegm, using blown medicine. If there is external redness and swelling, apply a circumferential poultice, leaving a large opening in the center, and moisten it to enhance the medicinal effect.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Wind Heat</strong></p>
<p>Swelling is red with a hint of purple, shaped like a fist; the person&#39;s face is red and the eyes look upwards. Externally, there are strong heat and aversion to cold, resembling a condition of cold damage. This illness arises from long accumulation of heat toxins, which is then exacerbated by wind. If the patient&#39;s voice is weak, it is advisable to use herbs that moisten the lungs for treatment. The color is bright red, and over time turns purple-red; urgently use a small (golden) knife to prick it, or a reed knife, allowing a small amount of blood to flow out, thus relieving the heat. Then continue taking decoctions and blow powdered borneol on it for significant effect. When the purple-red color changes to light red, recovery is imminent.</p>
<p><strong>Yin Toxin</strong></p>
<p>Swelling is like a purple plum and appears black; if the color is shiny and blood red, it can be treated; if the yin toxin is black, it cannot be treated. Externally, there is aversion to cold, the body quivers, and there is pain in the waist and cold in the feet; this occurs in winter due to invasion of dampness and interaction with fire evil. If the blood is slightly red and the swollen area is soft, and there is phlegm in the throat, it can be treated; if the blood is red-black with severe swelling and hardness, and the throat is dry, it is difficult to treat. First, take the Five Blessings Detox Pills, then use the Suzi Descend Qi Decoction, followed by blowing powdered borneol. Abstain from alcohol for a month.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Accumulated Heat Causing Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The swelling appears like a yellow sugar plum, slightly yellow with red veins on top. There are external symptoms of pain in the neck and toothache, indicating heat in the stomach channel. The stomach energy connects to the throat, hence the throat abscess occurs. The method to expel phlegm is the same as before. Blow in medicine, using powdered borneol mixed with Yuanming powder; for decoction, add angelica and astragalus, with double the amount of honeysuckle.</p>
<p><strong>Mute Phlegm Wind</strong></p>
<p>This mute phlegm condition occurs when phlegm from wind invades between the throat and diaphragm, causing the inability to speak and locked jaws. Urgently use toad venom, ground into water and dropped into the nostrils to open it up. Then, drop tung oil into the throat, and use goose feathers to stir the wind and phlegm in the throat until it is expelled, after which use licorice soup to dispel the tung oil&#39;s influence, applying powdered borneol. Additionally, take Jingfang Baidu powder in three doses. If the face is purplish, tongue is bluish, lips are black, nose runs with cold mucus, nails are also blue, and the eyes tear excessively, treatment is not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>Tongue Manipulation Wind</strong></p>
<p>This symptom is an inability to speak, with the tongue protruding as the patient often twists it with their hands. Urgently use the cleft of both thumbs to prick with a three-edged needle, three pricks for each finger. If there is blood, it can be treated; if not, it cannot. If needling the less shang point, it is also effective. Use a metal spoon to pry open the mouth, then blow gallnut powder into the throat. In the lamp&#39;s wick oil, dip goose feathers to stir out phlegm. Furthermore, take seven pills of xionghuang detoxification pill, washed down with clear tea; after that, take a wind-dispersing licorice-citrus soup; finally, blow powdered borneol frequently.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Swelling and Closure</strong></p>
<p>This poison arises from the spleen channels, due to the consumption of fried, oily foods, excessive drinking, and sexual activity, causing toxic gases to be unable to circulate and to accumulate at the root of the throat. If not treated promptly, the toxic closure may lead to sudden death. The treatment method is first to use vinegar water and juice to eliminate phlegm, then to apply throat-blowing medicine, blowing several times, followed by taking the Ba Zheng Shun Qi powder.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Knot</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises in the middle of the sternum, initially appearing like a plum pit situated between the throat and diaphragm, unable to be expelled or swallowed. After three days, it gradually rises to the throat, known as a throat knot. This disease requires puncturing; afterward, use bile nitre pill and blow it into the throat; then take seven pills of arsenic detoxification pill; still use the Si Qi Tang for five doses; finally, blow in ice powder.</p>
<p><strong>Qi Obstruction and Closure</strong></p>
<p>This condition is caused by accumulated poison blocking the throat, with thick phlegm and fever. It is still divided into three sections: upper, middle, and lower. If the poison is in the lower section, it is difficult to treat; for the upper and middle sections, use throat-blowing medicine several times, followed by tea to wash it down; take seven pills of arsenic detoxification pill; then consume Shen Ling Shun Qi powder. </p>
<p><strong>Choking Wind from Food</strong><a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>This condition results from heat and toxin affecting the heart channel, causing dryness in the throat without phlegm. If there is choking, treatment is not advisable. Use Chuanjisi Powder. If there is stabbing pain in the heart and lung area, continue with Danggui Lianqiao Powder and increase the dose of Dahuang for purgation. If left untreated for a long time, it can turn into a severe and deadly toxin that can harm life.</p>
<p><strong>Emotion-Induced Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This toxin arises from emotions such as joy, anger, worry, thought, sadness, fear, and shock, which injure the seven emotions, causing them to stagnate and form an abscess. The toxin then develops in the throat, and without prompt treatment, there is concern about the toxin attacking from within. If the throat bones protrude, pus will certainly emerge inside the mouth. Although it may not endanger life, it can lead to chronic conditions like a cold fistula. Use Shiqi Powder to treat it.</p>
<p><strong>Heel Wind</strong></p>
<p>This condition begins at the heel and extends to the throat, potentially recurring once a year or every six months. Avoid hot substances and do not be harmed by anger. The illness travels through one acupuncture point each day, and after seven days, seven points would be affected. Although it is not detrimental, it must be expressed. Use throat-soothing medicine and continue taking antidote powder. If there are foul-smelling bubbles, it can be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Closure</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from external cold evil and internal heat harm, or from washing in hot water after a severe cold, forcing cold air into the lung channel, obstructing cold air in the middle jiao, and evil heat lodging in the heart channel, resulting in this illness. Urgently use a three-edged needle to prick the purple vein at the wrist or cause bleeding from the Shaoshang point; then use realgar detoxification pills crushed with cold tea for administration; also blow powdered Bingsh片 into the throat and wait for the expulsion of thick phlegm as a sign of recovery. Additionally, take Banzheng Junqi Powder first, and then Yushu Pill.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Focal Tumor</strong></p>
<p>The throat tumors appear on either side of the throat, either single or double, resembling large round eyes, wrapped in blood vessels; hence they are named. This condition arises when the lung meridian is overheated, often due to excessive talking that damages qi, explosive shouting when angry, hurried recitation, excessive drinking of strong alcoholic beverages, or overeating roasted and grilled foods. If provoked, it causes pain; if not, there is no pain. It is essential to calm the mind and breathe gently, using medication to combat it, which will lead to the disappearance of this condition. Do not attempt to break it open with a knife; it is advisable to take nourishing qi and wind-dispelling decoction, and apply musk powder.</p>
<p><strong>Suspended Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This toxin forms in the upper palate, resembling a purple plum, and descends to the tongue. The person cannot speak, cannot extend the tongue, cannot lower the head, and must stand upright with the face up; red nasal discharge may occur. If not treated promptly, the toxin may penetrate into the brain, leading to death. The treatment involves using a copper spoon to open the mouth, and a bamboo needle to puncture the head of the abscess, cleaning it with salt water until all blood has been expelled. Ice powder is then blown into the affected area, and the mouth is closed to allow the medicine to work and be swallowed naturally. This process should be repeated three to five times; one should also take a decoction of Schizonepeta and Forsythia, followed by three pills of toxic transformation powder, and drink cold tea to cleanse. Despite appearing externally, this condition originates in the upper palate inside the mouth.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Throat Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>A throat ulcer is caused by toxic qi from the heart and wind evil from the small intestine manifesting at the auditory orifice and penetrating the side of the thorax. It initially appears like a scrofula, where the sufferer cannot eat or drink, resulting in obstruction and difficulty. Gradually, it swells, ruptures, and purulently discharges. If treated early, recovery is possible. It is recommended to take herbal mixtures such as the Dang Gui and Lian Qiao powder, and internally use Borneol powder or Niu Huang Qing Xin Wan for treatment. Earthworms are not restricted; they can be mixed with musk and Borneol for topical application.</p>
<p><strong>Residual Poison in Throat from Cold Damage</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from residual poison due to cold damage that does not dissipate, leading to a closure of the throat after eight or nine days. It is caused by heat poison entering the heart and spleen channels. Urgent medication includes Si Qi Decoction with two or three doses, followed by Borneol powder, and then the Quan Du Liu Qi Decoction.</p>

<p><strong>Disease of Hidden Qi</strong></p>
<p>The disease of hidden qi refers to those who are caught off-guard by cold weather, which then settles in the Lesser Yin channel, initially unnoticed until it manifests after ten days. The first symptom is sore throat, followed by diarrhea. The pulse is weak, which the ancients referred to as kidney cold damage. It is advised to use Ban Xia Gui Zhi Gan Tang.<br><strong>Direct Pointer of the Ren School</strong> [Song Dynasty, Yang Shi Ying]<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>One Principle, Many Particulars</strong></p>
<p>The throat connects to the stomach, and the pharynx is an opening for lung qi. The throat swallows food, while the pharynx allows for the flow of qi. This unity is manifested in various distinctions.</p>
<p><strong>Suspended Sore</strong></p>
<p>A suspended sore in the throat is connected to vital areas; if the condition is not treated urgently, it can be fatal. The sore arises from the hard palate and is related to the throat. Therefore, if there is sudden swelling, it is also due to excessive heat.</p>
<p><strong>Plum-pit Qi</strong></p>
<p>When emotions are stagnant, phlegm and saliva accumulate, forming solid masses in the chest and abdomen that can block the throat like a plum pit. This prevents swallowing and leads to choking, harming the intake of food and drink. It is advisable to use the medicine &quot;Si Qi Decoction.&quot; Men and women with this condition should avoid anger and cold foods.</p>
<p><strong>Corpse Throat</strong></p>
<p>Corpse throat arises from imbalanced yin and yang, excess spleen and lung energy, and the invasion of wind, heat, and toxins, which cannot circulate normally. This causes parasites to activate, eroding the throat, causing itching or pain, akin to symptoms of hidden pests within. It should be differentiated from conditions like typhus and treated accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Grain Thief</strong></p>
<p>Grain thief refers to the sharp husks concealed within rice that, if mistakenly consumed, obstruct the throat and cannot be processed. Wind and heat combine with stagnant qi and blood, leading to swelling and pain. Urgent treatment is required, as it can also be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Pain</strong></p>
<p>Throat pain occurs when wind evil invades the throat, causing qi stagnation and heat, resulting in pain.</p>
<p><strong>Ulcers</strong><a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>A sore throat is caused by excess heat in the stomach area, which disrupts the three burners, manifesting as white heads and red roots. It is advisable to disperse the condition with sound.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The throat refers to the act of swallowing, while the larynx is related to the breath. The interaction between substances and air is contingent on the throat and larynx. When yin and yang are balanced, and the protective and nourishing energies are well-regulated, the pathways of qi flow freely. However, if one neglects nourishment, favors consuming minerals, indulges in overly roasted foods, or drinks excessively hot alcohol, it causes stagnation in the chest, leading to the accumulation of hot toxic energies that cannot be expelled, resulting in throat ailments. These ailments can present as swelling, pain, pharyngitis, or obstruction, leading to sores that cannot be swallowed or expelled, resembling flesh, all caused by wind, heat, and toxic energies. Additionally, there could be residual heat rising and burdening the soft palate, which may become enlarged. The soft palate pertains to the upper palate. There may also be cold in the internal organs, leading to an inability to swallow. Treatment should be approached with discernment.</p>
<p>The throat allows for the intake of substances, also known as the epiglottis. It is a critical passage for the flow of qi, connected to the stomach and governed by the earth&#39;s energies. The larynx is the space that allows for the passage of breath, connecting to the lungs and governed by heavenly energies. If the organ energies are balanced, illness does not arise; if they are imbalanced, with cold and heat leading to stagnation, disease develops. The key to treatment is to clear heat, warm cold, and harmonize the system when temperatures are neither hot nor cold according to the principles of classical texts.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Hanjian Six Writings by Liu Wanshu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Throat Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Throat obstruction: &quot;Obstruction&quot; means lack of sensation. It is often written as &quot;closure,&quot; akin to blockage. Fire governs swelling, hence heat affects the upper part and causes swelling of the throat.</p>
<p><strong>Ming Theory by Cheng Wujì</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain, Itch, and Blockage</strong></p>
<p>When the throat is not functioning well, it may either be painful or itchy, and one may be unable to eat, all resulting from toxic energy rising. The classics state: if a person with a Taiyang condition has a tight pulse, they will surely have throat pain; this happens as Taiyang evil strikes the Shaoyin. The Shaoyin pulse runs along the throat and surrounds the base of the tongue. In cases of Shaoyin throat pain, the pulse is floating and slow; there may be chilling symptoms, or diarrhea, which are also related to Shaoyin. It is inappropriate to induce sweating or purging. Use a mixture of Platycodon decoction or Pigskin decoction; in severe cases, add Banxia powder, Tongmai Sini decoction without Peony, but add Platycodon. If sweating does not stop, apply a warm powder. For ulcers in the throat where one cannot speak, use a bitter wine decoction. If a person suffers from cold damage for six to seven days followed by significant purging, with a deep and slow pulse, absent pulse in the wrists, throat issues, blood and pus in the saliva, and persistent cold extremities, it is difficult to treat. One should use a Mahuang Shengma decoction. In cases of kidney cold damage, usually resulting from unexpected cold damaging the Shaoyin channels, with headache and back pain, the pulse is weak, initially throat pain due to cold damage, followed by diarrhea and throat pain. Banxia Guizhi decoction is recommended, which is the same as Banxia Sini decoction. For throat blockage, use Wufan decoction. For oral ulcers that are red and rotting, soak Huangbo in honey and dissolve it in the mouth. If throat pain is severe, use Shengma Liuwu decoction.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Confucian Duty to Parents</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Throat and Tongue Explanation</strong></p>
<p>The throat and tongue function differently, much like various remedies. The pharynx and throat, epiglottis and tongue, are all part of the same system, yet their roles are distinct. The throat allows for the passage of air, thus connecting to the heavens; the pharynx facilitates swallowing, hence connecting to the earth. The epiglottis and throat work together to manage openings; when food descends, the epiglottis closes to prevent aspiration, and during breathing, it opens to release air, allowing the tongue to touch the hard palate, thus enabling the epiglottis to seal off the pharynx. These four components interact and are essential; if one is absent, the processes of eating and drinking cease, leading to death. These four are indeed the gates through which air and food enter and exit, hence the critical nature of the “seven orifices” mentioned in the “Nan Jing,” with the epiglottis functioning as the door for inhalation. </p>
<p>When ailments arise, they can be summarized in one word: fire. The “Nei Jing” states: &quot;When yin and yang are in conflict, it is called throat obstruction.&quot; The commentary by Wang Taifu explains that &quot;one yin&quot; refers to the lesser yin of the hand, which is governed by the heart&#39;s fire; &quot;one yang&quot; refers to the lesser yang of the hand, related to the fire of the three heaters. Both fires govern the collaterals and channels in the throat; if heat accumulates, it leads to obstruction, and if obstruction worsens, it results in swelling, which can lead to blockage, ultimately resulting in death. The lesser yin of the foot follows the throat and envelops the root of the tongue, while the lesser yin of the hand encloses the pharynx; these two elements are indeed significant.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>As for the pathways of the foot yangming which follow the throat, the foot taiyin which connects the pharynx to the root of the tongue, the hand taiyang which traverses the throat and descends into the diaphragm, and the foot jueyin which follows behind the throat—these meridians all mention the throat, yet the shaoyang does not refer to the throat. In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it speaks of one yin and one yang, referring to throat obstruction; why is this? It is because when people study the twelve meridians, many do not read the &quot;Lingshu&quot; text. The eleven chapters of the classic clearly record the principles of the twelve meridians, stating: The main pathway of the foot shaoyang circles the thigh and enters the hairline, connecting to the jueyin; the others enter the lateral costal region, follow through the chest, belong to the gallbladder, spreading above the liver, penetrating above the heart, and connect to the throat, emerging at the lower jaw. They scatter to the face, intertwine at the eyes, and connect the shaoyang to the outer canthus of the eyes.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The palm of the hand governs the heart, distinguishing it from the depths of the liquid three inches below, entering the chest, associated with the sanjiao, emerging through the throat and exiting behind the ears, merging beneath the bony region of the lesser yang. This is the qi of the hand&#39;s lesser yang sanjiao, combined with the qi of the heart&#39;s lesser yin, traveling through the throat. Examining the twelve meridians, only the foot taiyang diverges beneath the neck; the rest converge in the throat. Yet, why does the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; specifically mention the union of one yin and one yang resulting in throat obstruction? The essence lies in the governance of the two fires: when one prevails alone, it generates a heat-induced blockage, causing pain and rapidity. I argue that one can sum this up as fire. Therefore, in the twelve meridians, symptoms like throat dryness and pain, swelling of the pharynx, and strength at the base of the tongue, are all manifestations of the sovereign fire. Only the urgent throat obstruction arises from the fire of the minister. The sovereign fire resembles human fire; the minister fire resembles dragon fire. Human fire consumes wood slowly, while dragon fire does so rapidly. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; refers to throat obstruction, which situates the pharynx and tongue in between, as their ailments are both related to fire, hence they are not distinctly separated.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>In later times, physicians described various conditions in detail and established eight categories: single乳蛾 (milk moth), double乳蛾, single闭喉 (closed throat), double闭喉,子舌胀 (swollen sublingual),木舌胀 (swollen wooden tongue),缠喉风 (phlegm obstructing the throat), and走马喉闭 (rapid throat obstruction). </p>
<p>Heat rises and congests thin membranes beside the throat, causing swelling; this resembles milk moths—single or double in presentation. The smaller variant resembling milk moths is termed closed throat. If heat accumulates beneath the tongue, a small protrusion forms, called子舌胀. Heat accumulating in the middle of the tongue causes swelling, referred to as木舌胀. &quot;Wood&quot; signifies firmness without softness. When heat accumulates in the throat, swelling occurs externally, becoming both numb and itchy; if large, it is termed缠喉风. The condition of immediate death from throat obstruction is called走马喉痹. </p>
<p>Though these eight names are detailed, if they do not originate from heat, they are fundamentally different. Mild cases can be treated with softening methods, while severe cases require pungent dispersal; modern doctors have corresponding remedies such as mint, aconite, silkworms, white alum, and similar substances. As for走马喉痹, no such remedies are needed; it can swiftly lead to death. The most reliable method for treatment is bloodletting with a needle; once blood flows, the illness resolves. The Book of Changes states: &quot;When blood is expelled, healing occurs.&quot; </p>
<p>In the past, I treated a woman with木舌胀, her tongue filling her mouth, and various medicines proved ineffective. I used a small, sharp needle for bloodletting, resulting in significant reduction in swelling after five or seven attempts; it took three days to fully return to normal. The amount of blood expelled was nearly a斗 (a measure).<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>I treated a man who had a swelling from throat wind, affecting both inside and outside, and he could not swallow medicine. I used cool medicine to irrigate his nose, administering it through more than ten lines. Externally, I applied a detoxifying powder. I ground equal parts of the Yangqi stone and dragon liver into a fine powder, washing it with fresh water a hundred times a day. After three days, the heat began to recede, and the swelling started to diminish. </p>
<p>I also treated a noblewoman for a throat blockage, which was also due to dragon fire. Although cool medicine was used, it could not be taken orally. Since it was dragon fire, it should be expelled with heat. The heat referred to is the cooking fire. I exposed her to the blazing sun and had her ascend to a high terrace, instructing her handmaid to carry a fire stove and place it over the medicine pot, keeping the medicine continuously very hot, but not boiling vigorously. She would sip it from time to time, over a hundred times, allowing the dragon fire to disperse. This method utilizes heat to counteract cold, thus avoiding the conflict with heat illness.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>In general, treating throat phlegm by drawing blood with needles is the most effective method. However, people fear needles, and seeking alternatives can lead to immediate death. If there are needle wounds from using needles, it is advisable to crush a piece of fresh ginger and mix it with hot white soup, sipping on it periodically to help the wound close easier. The &quot;Copper Man&quot; also mentions moxibustion, but it is only suitable for mild cases; for severe cases, delay may be deadly. Therefore, treating the fire of throat phlegm should be treated with urgency, akin to extinguishing a fire. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that when fire is stagnated, it must be released, referring to inducing sweat. However, how can one induce sweating in the throat? Thus, drawing blood is a form of inducing sweat. Future practitioners should not cling to narrow methods, claiming that their treatment does not affect the internal organs, which is superior to bloodletting. If they are fortunate enough to succeed with minor ailments, they may unfortunately encounter serious illnesses and face fatal consequences. Let there be no regret afterwards.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain from Throat Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Throat obstruction is generally due to phlegm-heat; for severe cases, use tung oil to induce vomiting. Sore throat with ulcers is due to deficiency heat. Blood deficiency often leads to false fire, wandering unrestrained, affecting the throat. Use ginseng, schisandra, and honey-fried gentian. For false fire, use ginseng and bamboo juice. For blood deficiency, use the Four Substances with bamboo juice. For excess heat, use huanglian (Coptis chinensis), schisandra, mint, and saltpeter, mixed with honey and ginger juice to dissolve and gargle; alternatively, take some clean, finely ground dandelion root, mix it with a little good wine, and drip it into the throat for immediate relief from pain. For throat pain, schisandra must be used; for yin deficiency fire rising, use codonopsis. For sore throat, mix borax with alun, white silkworm, and white plum meat to gargle; again, schisandra and codonopsis must be used.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Throat Wind</strong></p>
<p>Throat wind is associated with phlegm heat. Dai Sigong states that when both the inside and outside of the throat are swollen, it is so. Throat wind, and the symptoms of throat closure, arise from the presence of phlegm and saliva in the diaphragm or from unregulated alcohol, lust, and emotions. When fire agitates the phlegm and obstructs the throat, it leads to swelling and pain both internally and externally, making it impossible for fluids to be ingested; this can be considered dangerous and urgent. The symptoms of throat wind appear first with a tight feeling in the chest and diaphragm, shortness of breath, and suddenly swelling and pain in the throat, along with coldness in the hands and feet, leading to obstructed breath if left untreated for even a moment.</p>
<p><strong>Breast Moth</strong></p>
<p>The single moth wind appears round, about the size of a small chopstick head, located above the throat, either on the left or right side, and is difficult to treat below the throat. The double moth wind consists of two similar round formations on either side of the throat, also about the size of a small chopstick head, which is likewise difficult to treat below.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Wind</strong></p>
<p>Throat wind is identified by red coloration from the area around the jaw to beneath the jaw. Generally, both the inside and outside being swollen indicates throat wind. In cases of throat closure, where toxic energy returns to the heart, leading to fullness in the chest, accelerated breath, and persistent diarrhea from below, it is fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Suspended Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Suspended abscess is referred to as &quot;Emperor&#39;s Bell.&quot; When the abscess is swollen and hangs down several inches, it is called &quot;Emperor&#39;s Bell Wind.&quot; It is advisable to use a salt and alum powder; it should not be pricked, as doing so can be fatal.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Medical Treatise: An Overview</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The convergence of one Yin and one Yang is called throat obstruction. Wang&#39;s commentary explains that one Yin refers to the Jueyin liver and the pericardium, while one Yang refers to the Shaoyang gallbladder and the Sanjiao. All four channels contain the relative fire. Shuhe stated that the gallbladder and Sanjiao seek fire treatment, while the liver and pericardium are no different. Dongyuan remarked that fire and vital energy do not coexist; where one prevails, the other diminishes. When vital energy is deficient, relative fire can arise, causing sudden outbreaks of throat obstruction and similar ailments.</p>
<p>The epiglottis, referred to as the &#39;door of breath&#39; in the classics, is a crucial gateway for the elevation and descent of respiration in the human body. When there is sudden swelling and pain, with water and liquid unable to enter, and speech hindered, death can occur in an instant, which is truly alarming. Swelling on both sides of the epiglottis is colloquially known as &quot;double breast moth,&quot; which is easy to treat. Swelling on one side is called &quot;single breast moth&quot; and is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Ancient formulas referred to throat obstruction, which is caused by the rebellion of relative fire. The classics say: One water cannot overcome two fires; moreover, two waters cannot overcome five fires. This suggests the ease with which true water can be depleted and relative fire can become active. For instance, great anger can cause fire to rise from the liver, sexual indulgence can cause fire to rise from the kidneys, and irregular diet can incite fire from the spleen and stomach. Thus, fire is the root of phlegm, and phlegm is the manifestation of fire. Fire is characterized by its rapid nature, hence illnesses can erupt violently.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The method of treatment must first involve expelling the phlegm, or using a gold needle to puncture the swollen area; this is an urgent, symptomatic treatment. When using medicine, one must adhere to the treatment principles from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; employing herbs such as Platycodon, Licorice, Scrophularia, Cimicifuga, Saposhnikovia, Notopterygium, Schizonepeta, Ginseng, Atractylodes, and Poria, with a small addition of dried Ginger and Aconite, administered gradually and frequently, never taken in a single dose. This is the fundamental method of treatment. One must absolutely avoid taking cold and cooling medicines, as not only are they unhelpful, but they may also hasten death. The common people are often unaware of this principle and hastily resort to strong herbs like Scutellaria, Coptis, Gardenia, and Rhizoma Picrorhiza, believing they are treating the condition. Worse yet, they mix in very bitter and cold medicines, taking them frequently and in large doses, perceiving only a slight reduction in swelling or slightly improved speech, celebrating the effects with the physician, unaware that the underlying heat has not been resolved while cold has re-entered, allowing toxins to invade the abdomen, which may ultimately lead to persistent cough, becoming untreatable—how lamentable this is! </p>
<p>There is an external condition called &quot;big head disease,&quot; commonly known as &quot;pinched head plague,&quot; which is quite severe, with a mortality rate of eight or nine out of ten among those infected. Treatment should focus on regulating Qi, and the methods are not vastly different. A remarkable remedy is the &quot;Universal Detoxifying Drink&quot; by Dongyuan, proven to be effective, deserving of thorough study and expansion by practitioners, as it aims to save lives in this world, which is indeed fortunate!<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swelling and Pain</strong></p>
<p>For sore throat, sweet mandarin peel decoction (Ganji Tang) is recommended. If heat toxin attacks upward, with or without sores, and sweet mandarin peel decoction is ineffective, add a small amount of schizope, called &quot;Holy Decoction.&quot; Alternatively, in the Holy Decoction, add one part forsythia and half a part of euphorbia, or use sweet dew drink, along with Bingyun powder, prepared and consumed with salted water to nourish the body&#39;s essence, in conjunction with peppermint and chicken-suet pills to dissolve in the mouth. </p>
<p>If sore throat worsens with cold remedies, use ginger juice.<br>For internal heat manifesting in the upper jiao causing throat pain, use phellodendron bark, coptis, and rhubarb, ground into powder, mixed with water, applied to the soles of the feet and the affected area, as per &quot;Ye&#39;s Prescriptions.&quot; </p>
<p>For throat pain due to heat obstructing, or coughing with blood, use Jinfeicao powder, supplemented with cinnabar phlegm-dissolving pills. If throat pain does not improve with all cooling medicines, use Zhi Nan decoction. </p>
<p>For throat obstruction causing pain, swelling, and inability to speak, with foreign sensation in the throat (named &quot;throat wind&quot;), use sweet mandarin peel decoction. If heat obstructs the upper jiao, causing sore throat, and swallowing dry substances feels less moist than usual, with a dry mouth while sleeping, use Holy Decoction with half a part of ginseng and seven parts of original ginseng, or be supplemented with Bingyun powder and chicken-suet pills. </p>
<p>For concurrent upper obstruction and irritability in the heart, use the five spirit powder with cinnabar. In cases of upper obstruction, it is also advisable to crush sand shell into ash, preserve its essence, grind into powder, and take it mixed with water.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Medical Treatise</strong> 【Ming Dynasty - Lou Ying】</p>
<p><strong>Regarding Pain and Sores from Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;throat obstruction&quot; refers to the inability to breathe properly through the throat, resulting in a blockage of speech and air. The term for &quot;throat pain&quot; and &quot;pharyngeal pain&quot; indicates the throat&#39;s incapacity to swallow saliva and food, associated with blockages of the earth&#39;s energy. &quot;Throat obstruction combined with pharyngeal pain&quot; denotes an illness affecting both the throat and pharynx, leading to blockage of both celestial and earthly energies. It is evident that one suffering from throat obstruction must also experience pharyngeal pain, while those with isolated pharyngeal pain cannot simultaneously suffer from throat obstruction.</p>
<p>Throat obstruction accompanied by aversion to cold, and a weak pulse at the wrist, are considered exterior symptoms. In such cases, it is appropriate to use sweet tangerine decoction or a mixture of pinellia, cinnamon twig, and licorice to address the aspects of cold, heat, and dispersion. If one is unable to consume liquids, use the detoxifying xionghuang pill (realgar pill), grinding four or five pills in highly sour vinegar, administering it into the mouth, and then expectorate the thick phlegm. Follow this by sucking on the natural juice of fresh ginger, which has a remarkable effect.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>In cases of throat obstruction accompanied by chills, it is caused by cold defeating heat—cold confined externally and heat stagnating internally. Ginger juice disperses the external cold, allowing the internal heat to be released and thus lead to recovery. One must avoid using bile and copper sulfate, which are cold agents applied to the throat, as they can cause the yang to stagnate and not extend; also to avoid using cooling agents like nitre and yellow sulfur, as they would lead to the sinking of yang into the interior, resulting in disaster in no time. Han Zhihe states that when the pulse at the inch is weaker than that at the guan and chi, it is necessary to dissipate yin and assist yang. Dongyuan states that when the pulse at the two inches is insufficient, it indicates a deficiency of yang qi; thus, exterior medications are used to lift its energy to support yang. If all three positions have small and weak pulses, the same method can be applied.</p>
<p>Throat obstruction, which is common in rural areas, generally resembles one another, as they belong to the malady of the atmospheric influence of heaven. Therefore, treatment must first disperse the exterior, and it is highly forbidden to apply sour medicines or cold medicines, as they would cause the evil to remain internally and not be released. There are two types of illness: The first belongs to fire. The classic states: &quot;The lesser yang leads to throat obstruction.&quot; It also states that the lesser yang governs the affairs of heaven; when the summer heat arrives, the people suffer from throat obstruction. Treatment should follow Zhongjing’s syrup of platycodon. If there are red spots on the face, it indicates yang toxin, and one should utilize remedies for yang toxin to induce sweating. The second belongs to dampness.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The Classic says: The victory of the Taiyin leads to the internal accumulation of fire energy, causing throat obstruction. Additionally, it states: The Taiyin in the spring is overcome by excessive dampness, resulting in swelling of the throat and throat obstruction. The treatment should be to use a decoction of Banxia, Guizhi, and Gancao for the vitality of the person. If the face is bluish-black, it pertains to Yin poison, and it is suitable to sweat out the Yin poison using various prescriptions. </p>
<p>In the spring of the fifth year of Hongwu, there were many cases of throat obstruction in the villages, which was due to the qi at the end of the previous year and the beginning of this year, the two fires causing evils. I repeatedly used the Ganju Decoction with added Huanglian, Banxia, Jiangcan, and Shucan roots to induce sweating. For those with deficiency, I added Ren, Qishi, and Gui. If liquids do not enter, I first used the Detoxifying Xionghuang Pills, ground with vinegar and administered to the throat; phlegm would emerge, and then I would use fresh ginger juice to administer it again, using the above-mentioned medicine, all would be remarkably effective. However, if one uses acidic and cold treatments such as alum, they will not be curative, as the evil remains trapped within. </p>
<p>In cases of throat obstruction without aversion to cold, and when the pulse at the cun is large, slippery, and solid at the Guanchu, they all pertain to lower conditions.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>It is appropriate to use cooling herbs such as nitrate and indigo to lower conditions, or astringents like alum to gather them. Han Zhihe said: If the pulse at the inch is larger than that at the guan and chi, it is advisable to disperse yang and assist yin. Dongyuan states: If the two-inch pulse is solid, it indicates an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; if treated, it will improve. Therefore, I often employ this method to treat acute throat obstruction, as one would respond to a drum. If all three positions are solid, this method can also be applied.</p>
<p>In cases of acute throat obstruction, if the voice resembles snoring, as if there is phlegm resonating in the throat, this indicates a severe condition of the lungs. Immediate use of ginseng paste is necessary, consumed with ginger juice or bamboo juice. If ginseng paste is not available, first boil ginseng soup for relief. Taking it early leads to an almost full recovery; later, it results in a partial recovery and, if delayed, only minimal improvement.</p>
<p>For throat pain, there is a significant deficiency of yin and an excessive escaping of yang, with phlegm accumulating above, leading to the pain. The pulse must be floating and large, with a heavy touch yielding a roughness. Immediate treatment should restore balance between yin and yang, using only ginseng, boiled to a rich decoction and consumed slowly.</p>
<p>Throat ulcers tend to have excessive fire, roaming without restraint, troubling the throat. It is advisable to use ginseng, honey-fried yellow bitter herb, and schizonepeta to treat it.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Chen)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Throat Diseases Belong to Fire</strong></p>
<p>The respiration and the intake and output of food through the throat are the gateways of the human body. In later generations, there are eighteen named types of throat diseases, which, although diverse, all return to the element of fire. This is because the lesser yin provides the sovereign fire, and the lesser yang provides the ministerial fire; these two channels converge in the throat. If the sovereign fire is weak, it leads to heat accumulation, resulting in pain and swelling. If the ministerial fire is strong, it results in severe swelling and insensitivity, potentially leading to obstruction that may result in death. Hence, it is said: “The union of one yin and one yang leads to throat obstruction.” Both the liver and pericardium belong to yin, while the gallbladder and sanjiao belong to yang; all four channels have ministerial fire. Fire is the origin of phlegm, and phlegm is the manifestation of fire. Therefore, when mentioning fire, phlegm is inherently present; and when speaking of the throat, the teeth and tongue are also included.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Fire Differentiates Between Reality and Illusion</strong></p>
<p>Real fire is caused by overeating fried and roasted foods, leading to the accumulation of heat and toxins, resulting in thirst, constipation, phlegm, and wind attacking upwards, which can cause throat obstruction. There must be three days of discomfort in the chest and diaphragm, with a tight and rapid pulse. The treatment should first eliminate wind and phlegm, followed by detoxifying heat, cooling the diaphragm with a formula adding Huang Lian (Coptis), Jing Jie (Schizonepeta), and Shi Gao (Gypsum). Alternatively, one can use Gu Jing Huang Decoction, Fang Feng Tong Sheng Powder, or San Huang Pills to dissolve in the mouth. If wind dries the throat making it parched and spiky, causing difficulty in swallowing, use Bai Du San with added Huang Qin (Scutellaria), Ban Xia (Pinellia), and increase the amount of Jie Geng (Platycodon), Bo He (Mint), and Sheng Jiang (Ginger) for decoction. If phlegm is excessive, add Shi Gao. For these medications, take them at midday or later. If there is vomiting or damage due to consuming hot foods and prickly grains, along with swelling and pain from wind-heat clashing with blood and qi, use Xiao Feng San adding Bo He, Yuan Shen, and Quanfeng, or She Gan Decoction or Niu Bang Zi Decoction. For a heavy tongue, it is like a sacred golden ingot. For swelling at the root of the tongue, use She Xiang Zhu Sha Wan.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>For those experiencing sore throat, use the Puji Xiaodu drink. Excess heat from drinking alcohol stirs the spleen&#39;s fire; anger stirs the liver&#39;s fire; lust stirs the kidney&#39;s fire. When the fire rises and attacks, the throat and esophagus become dry, but urination remains normal, with a faint pulse in the lesser yin. Treatment should focus on tonifying deficiency and lowering heat. For those with blood deficiency, use Siwu Decoction with additional Platycodon, Schizonepeta, Anemarrhena, and Coptis; for those with qi deficiency, use Si Junzi Decoction with added Licorice, Platycodon, Radical Scrophulariae, and Cimicifuga, possibly with dry ginger and Aconite as guiding herbs, taken gradually. If phlegm is excessive, add a fresh fish gallbladder to Erchen Decoction, prepared with glutinous rice and dried into powder, and taken with ginger juice; consider also the Tanhutu or Qianjin decoctions. For those who have previously taken cooling medicines and have sound issues, use the Secret Transmission Decoction to regulate qi. </p>
<p>For sudden cold-induced throat constriction, use Chaiqiao Banxia Decoction or Pigskin Decoction. For kidney-related cold and yin conditions, use Banjiao Decoction with honey and Aconite. </p>
<p>Common remedies include Ganjiao Decoction, Ligao Decoction, Bingmei Pill, and Rhinoceros Horn and Amber Ointment; alternatively, use a single herbal powder mixed with honey to form pills the size of peanuts, taking three pills with freshly drawn water. </p>
<p>Generally, cooling medicines should not be used alone for the throat. A rapid effect may mask residual heat, leading to renewed cold symptoms. When toxic qi invades the abdomen, it can cause swelling in the chest, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and cyanosis of the hands and feet. If after seven days one cannot eat and the mouth resembles that of a fish, it can lead to death.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Jiao Tu Method</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jiao Method:</strong> Use powdered bile from a blue fish three times, and the swelling will disperse.<br><strong>Tu Method:</strong> Use the bile of a blue fish in winter, mixed with dry alum; when in use, add some finely roasted herbal powder and a little salt, mixed with vinegar, and use a goose feather to dip in the medicine to induce vomiting until all phlegm is expelled. If fish bile is not available, use half a pound of white alum and ten pieces of croton seed meat, combined with dry alum, then remove the croton, and induce vomiting; this is remarkably effective. After vomiting, use a golden key to blow it; regularly drinking sweet orange soup is most excellent. If the jaw is tightly clenched, use a jaw-opening medicine afterward, or two immortal powder; for those who are unconscious, use a one-character powder.</p>
<p><strong>Expelling Fire through Sweating</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Expelling fire through sweating&quot; means to induce sweat. Throat ulcers should avoid sweating to prevent worsening the condition. Only when using a needle to draw blood is the essence of sweating applicable. If a lot of blood is drawn, healing occurs. For those with needle sores, ginger juice mixed with warm water should be sipped at intervals. If the patient fears needles, apply a gentle needle technique. In cases where there are severe blood blisters on the upper body and none visible on the lower body, have the patient hold a mouthful of water and use a sharpened bamboo tube to prick the nostril and draw blood, which is effective. However, for those who have kidney damage from cold or swollen with Emperor&#39;s bell, needles should be avoided. Burn snake bed seeds in a bottle, and have the patient inhale the smoke into the throat for healing.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Switching Method</strong></p>
<p>Xionghuang Detox Pills, Longnao Poision Dispelling Powder, Yuyue Key; alternatively, use the oil from the seeds of ba dou (croton seed) pressed on oil paper to light a wick, then blow it out to produce smoke, which is inhaled through the nose for immediate effect, causing saliva to flow from the mouth and nose, and opening the teeth. One method uses the flesh of ba dou wrapped in cotton and inserted into both nostrils, which ensures a clear passage. This method employs ba dou to treat &#39;running horse throat obstruction&#39;, attacking heat with heat, as heat promotes circulation.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Obstruction and Loss of Voice</strong></p>
<p>For throat obstruction and loss of voice, use the secret recipe of Jiangqi Decoction with the addition of dried tangerine peel and Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis). For loss of voice due to wind-cold, use Ganqiao Decoction with Hezi fruit and Mutong, supplemented with fresh Rehmannia juice for moisture; or Hezi Powder. For blood deficiency leading to voice hoarseness, use Qingdai and He powder mixed with honey to dissolve in the mouth; or Lung Nourishing Pills with honey and grease simmered. If ordinary voice clarity is compromised, add Gui Ben Pills. For internal injury and atrophic throat issues causing loss of voice, no treatment method is available.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable and Effective Formulas</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Fang Xian)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Dai Ren Yun: The throat and the larynx, the epiglottis and the tongue, these four exist within one system, yet their causes differ. The throat is for taking in air, thus the throat&#39;s air communicates with heaven; the larynx is for taking in food, thus the larynx&#39;s air communicates with the earth. The epiglottis and the larynx work in conjunction to control opening and closing; when food descends, it is sucked in and covered, and when air rises, it is exhaled. Hence, when the tongue presses against the hard palate, the epiglottis can close off the throat. These four interact in function; if one is missing, eating and drinking cease, leading to death. These four are the portals for the circulation of air and food, being in the most critical area, which is why they cause illness; signs of throat pain and laryngeal obstruction are difficult to treat. Mild cases may be cured through treatment, but severe cases often result in peril. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;A blockage of one yin and one yang is termed laryngeal obstruction.&quot; Wang&#39;s commentary states that one yin refers to the Hand Shaoyin’s Heart channel, while one yang refers to the Hand Shaoyang’s San Jiao channel. Both fires govern the channels and are interconnected in the larynx; when air is hot, it can lead to internal blockages, which, if severe, cause swelling; excessive swelling leads to obstruction, and if obstruction becomes extreme, it can result in death. It&#39;s not just these two channels causing this illness; according to the twelve channels, only the Foot Taiyang diverges below the neck, while the others converge at the throat. Hence, when the two fires (the Ruler and Officer) dominate, the heat causes blockages, leading to pain and rapid onset.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>In the twelve meridians, pain in the throat, swelling in the jaw, and swelling of the tongue are primarily caused by the Emperor Fire. However, a sudden closure of the throat is attributed to the Minister Fire. The Emperor Fire is akin to human fire; the Minister Fire is similar to dragon fire. Human fire burns wood slowly; dragon fire burns wood rapidly. The texts state that a throat obstruction involves both the throat and tongue, and since the affliction is due to fire, they are not differentiated. Later scholars should examine its details; here are eighteen symptoms of throat and pharynx disorders:</p>
<ol>
<li>Single Wind (Dan E Feng) - appears as a round shape about the size of a small chopstick head near the upper throat; it can appear on either side and can be treated; those appearing lower are difficult to treat.</li>
<li>Double Wind (Shuang E Feng) - two round shapes, each about the size of a small chopstick, appearing on either side of the throat; those appearing lower are difficult to treat.</li>
<li>Cicada Tongue Wind (Chan She Feng), also known as &quot;Re-grown Tongue&quot; - a second tongue regenerating from below the original tongue.</li>
<li>Toothworm Wind (Ya Qi Feng) - swelling on the gums leading to pus-filled sores.</li>
<li>Wood Tongue Wind (Mu She Feng) - the tongue gradually enlarges, resembling a cooked pig tongue, unable to move.</li>
<li>Yellow Tongue Wind (She Huang Feng) - swelling and pain on the tongue with a yellow color.</li>
<li>Biting Teeth and Locking Wind (Yao Ya Jin Feng) - teeth at the end become gnarled, and the mouth cannot open.</li>
<li>Fish Mouth Wind (Yu Kou Feng) - resembles a fish sucking water and is untreatable.</li>
<li>Gathered Toxins Blocking Throat Wind (Ju Du Se Hou Feng) - toxins gathered in the throat with thick saliva, causing chills and fevers; those above can be treated legally, but those below are difficult to treat.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>Ten: The suspended Qi poison wind causes swelling around the eyes, difficulty swallowing water, and external swelling resembling hen&#39;s eggs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Eleven: The choking food wind, also known as the flying silk poison, causes the mouth to foam when consuming foul-smelling raw food.</p>
<p>Twelve: The hunting cheek wind results in swelling of the cheeks, breaking swelling where the teeth have worn down.</p>
<p>Thirteen: The winding throat wind manifests as redness below the jaw; it can also exhibit extreme cold or heat, posing a serious danger.</p>
<p>Fourteen: The pine nut wind fills the mouth, causing the throat to be red like pig liver; when one opens the mouth to swallow, the breath is obstructed, leading to an inability to eat or drink. Blow-throat medicine can be used, or apply medicinal powder to the swollen area. If mild, it will recede; if severe, there will be rapid throat obstruction, which can be fatal if untreated.</p>
<p>Fifteen: The collapsing sand sweet mouth wind causes the gums under the tongue to swell red, and the mouth feels hot, resembling soup; if the gum condition worsens, it may result in tooth loss.</p>
<p>Sixteen: The linked pearl wind starts under the tongue, initially appearing as one, then another; in severe cases, three, five, seven, or nine linked pearls may form.</p>
<p>Seventeen: The bee venom appears as itching and sores on the cheeks or under the tongue, resembling a yellow color like a bee.</p>
<p>Eighteen: The traveling scrofula wind causes multiple swollen lymph nodes on the neck, with skin redness and swelling, resulting in cold and heat sensations. </p>
<p>Only the wooden tongue indicates stiffness without softness. Heat accumulates in the throat, swelling externally, causing numbness and itching, and a significant swelling is known as the winding throat wind. Sudden throat paralysis leading to rapid death is referred to as the galloping horse throat paralysis.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>Although the eighteen types of ailments are distinct in name, their treatment should not be far removed from the concept of fire. Minor ailments can be alleviated with softness, while more serious ones can be resolved with sharpness. For treating these conditions, the world has methods such as mint, aconite, silkworms, alum, nitrum, and verdigris. As for the throat affliction caused by running horse, what need is there for these remedies? The difference between life and death is as close as a person&#39;s palm. The least harmful method is bloodletting with a needle; once blood flows, the illness is resolved. Yet, people fear needles and seek other means. If one persists in this, they risk losing their life in an instant. When using needles, if one chokes, it is advisable to crush a piece of fresh ginger and mix it with hot white soup to sip occasionally, which will mitigate the choking. Treating throat afflictions is akin to firefighting; it cannot be taken lightly. According to various texts, for a swollen tongue, urgently use a small and sharp needle to draw blood five to seven times to alleviate the condition. For wind swelling in the throat that cannot be relieved by medicine, instill cool medicine through the nose to expel it, while also applying a detoxifying poultice outside; once heat diminishes, the swelling will subside. Throat afflictions are related to dragon fire; even when using cooling agents, one should frequently sip on an intensely hot decoction. This medicine acts with heat to guide out the cold, not as a rejection of heat illnesses. Additionally, frequently pricking the Lesser Shang point with a small needle to draw blood can lead to recovery. Future practitioners must distinguish between human fire and dragon fire ailments; effective treatments will follow.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Six Essentials of Medical Principles (Ming - Zhang Sanxi)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Throat Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>The throat swallows substances, while the larynx awaits the wind; its essence is clear and void, allowing no trace of turbidity. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: the qi of the three jiao connects to the throat, hence vocal sounds arise. Nevertheless, the three jiao pertains to the fire of the yang, and fire leads to diseases appearing rapidly, thus a sudden swelling in the throat is called &quot;throat obstruction&quot; in ancient texts. There may also be phlegm-fire rising from the stomach, causing obstruction in the patient. Generally, if it arises abruptly, it must be phlegm-fire, and the urgent remedy is to induce vomiting, while needling to dispel toxic blood is superb. Those ignorant are fearful and hesitant, often leading to unfortunate outcomes, showcasing a lack of understanding of the correct principles.</p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Cases (Ming - Xue Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obstruction Pain Syndromes</strong></p>
<p>Master Danxi said: throat pain is due to blood deficiency, treated with Si Wu Decoction plus bamboo juice; for yin deficiency with rising fire, one must use Yuan Shen; for qi deficiency, add ginseng and bamboo juice. Furthermore, for swelling and pain in the throat, if there is yin deficiency and yang energy surging, with phlegm binding above, the pulse must be floating and large, while the heavy pulse should be thin. To expel the dead, one should use ginseng decocted strongly and drunk slow. If one treats it with methods for solid symptoms, the calamity is at hand. This is something previously unrecognized by others, saving countless lives from premature demise. Additionally, I mention the conditions related to upper jiao wind-heat and bladder yin deficiency briefly afterward. Pain or cold and heat indicate the pathogen is at the surface, thus it should be dispersed. For swelling, pain, and an abundance of phlegm and saliva, the pathogen is above.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>If there is pain with a rapid and weak pulse, it indicates a deficiency of Yin; one should nourish Yin and clear heat. If there is swelling, pain, fever, and constipation, this indicates a condition of excess both inside and outside; one should resolve the exterior and attack the interior. If the symptoms are urgent, one may puncture the affected area or needle the Shaoshang point. </p>
<p>Mr. Xiaoshan says: In cases of throat obstruction without aversion to cold, with a pulse that is large and slippery at the cun and guan positions, these indicate a lower condition; it is advisable to use cold medicines such as Niter or Indigo to reduce it, or sour agents like copper sulfate to collect it. Mr. Han Zhihe states: If the cun pulse is larger than the guan and chi pulses, one should disperse Yang and assist Yin. Mr. Dongyuan notes: Both cun pulses being solid indicates excessive Yang and deficient Yin; by purging it, one can promote recovery. Therefore, I respect this method for treating the aforementioned conditions, akin to the response of a drum.</p>
<p>Chen Zangqi often treats interior cold and throat obstruction, causing difficulty in swallowing and expectoration, using prepared Aconite without skin and navel, coated with honey and roasted, so that the honey can enter; one should hold it in the mouth without swallowing. It is said to be very effective.</p>
<p><strong>Meiheqi</strong></p>
<p>Meiheqi refers to a sensation of blockage in the throat, where one cannot cough it out or swallow it down, resembling a plum pit. This is caused initially by excess joy and anger, which accumulates heat and leads to phlegm and fluid stagnation, resulting in this ailment. One should use a modified version of the Siqi Decoction and a modified version of the Erchen Decoction.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br><strong>Phlegm-Heat in the Throat</strong></p>
<p>Heat accumulates in the throat, causing swelling around the outside, resulting in numbness and itchiness. Severe swelling is termed &quot;Wind Phlegm in the Throat.&quot; If the throat is closed and suddenly leads to death, it is called &quot;Running Horse Throat Phlegm.&quot; </p>
<p>Phlegm-Heat arises when heat rises and affects both sides of the throat, creating external swelling. It resembles the shape of a butterfly, with one side being singular and the other double. The smaller variety of this phlegm is called &quot;Throat Closure.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</p>
<p><strong>Throat Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If one asks about the occurrence of abscesses on both sides of the throat, the response is: This is called &quot;夹疽&quot; (Throat Abscess), which pertains to the Heart Channel of the Lesser Yin, the Spleen Channel of the Greater Yin, and the Liver Channel of the Jueyin, resulting from hot toxic energies rising. It is advisable to use amber and rhinoceros horn ointment, rhinoceros horn powder, Huanglian Disinfectant Decoction, and Huoming Decoction with added Yan Shen, Jie Geng, and Huang Lian. Those with internal suppuration are difficult to treat. If there is rising fire from deficiency and phlegm blockage with an inability to eat, death may ensue.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>If one asks about the occurrence of a carbuncle in the throat, the response is: It is termed &quot;Throat Carbuncle,&quot; also known as &quot;Severe Carbuncle.&quot; Due to its intense heat and toxicity, it is fearsome. It belongs to the Ren Channel as well as the Hand Taiyang and Hand Shaoyin, resulting from accumulated heat and worry. It is urgent to clear heat and attack toxins, using amber and rhinoceros horn ointment, Huanglian Disinfectant Decoction, Ziyin Dan, and Wujin San as options. For those who are robust, one gold pill should be administered. If treatment is delayed and it ruptures through the throat, it may lead to death.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>Discussion of Swelling and Pain in the Throat</strong></p>
<p>The throat and the pharynx are not the same. The throat is the gateway for breathing from the lungs, primarily responsible for exhalation rather than inhalation; the pharynx is the pathway for food and water from the stomach, primarily responsible for inhalation rather than exhalation. The throat and pharynx regulate breathing and control ascending and descending, acting as critical gateways of the body. The classics say: &quot;The illness arising from the foot&#39;s lesser yin manifests as thirst, dry tongue, swollen pharynx, shortness of breath, dry throat, and pain.&quot; The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: &quot;Evil influences on the foot&#39;s lesser yin channels cause swelling and pain in the throat, preventing food intake.&quot; Additionally, it says: &quot;The channels of the foot&#39;s lesser yin run through the throat and connect to the root of the tongue.&quot; Therefore, any throat pain is a disease of the lesser yin, with distinctions of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess. The fire of the lesser yin surges upward like galloping horses, clashing at the throat where the energies are tightly locked. This causes the qi to become stagnant, resulting in swelling or pain. The symptoms must include internal heat, dry mouth, reddened face, and phlegm surging upward; the pulse at the wrist will be rapid yet weak. This is due to the depletion of kidney water, leaving the fire of the yuan (original) unchecked. One must use a large dose of Six-Flavor Rehmannia, Asparagus, and Five-Flavor remedy to be taken as a decoction. If there is excessive desire leading to depletion of the original yang with unrooted fire wandering uncontrolled in the throat, one must use a large dose of Eight-Flavor Kidney Qi Pill, decocted and cooled to drink, to draw fire back to its source for a chance of rescue. This treatment method for throat pain due to yin deficiency aligns with what Zhu says about treating upper body diseases by addressing the lower body.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>The throat of a person resembles a curved pipe; when the fire burns within, if water is poured in from above, the pipe will explode violently. Only below the stove, when a basin of water is reflected, the above fire will extinguish; this is one proof of treating an upper ailment by addressing the lower part. </p>
<p>Among these conditions, there are milk worms and throat worms, which have different names. Swelling on both sides of the throat is called double worm, while swelling on one side is called single worm. The treatment involves dipping a goose feather in rice vinegar to clear the phlegm from the throat, then using the goose feather to induce a cough, aiming to expel the purple blood from the worm for resolution; or grinding a purple gold ingot would also work. If it doesn&#39;t disperse, a small knife can be used to pierce and release the purple blood for recovery. </p>
<p>There is an ancient method to puncture the lesser shang point, which is very effective. Bloodletting with a knife or needle should be used in urgent cases, but there are also situations where it is not advisable. Xue refers to a case of a fifty-year-old man with a swollen and painful throat; when blood was drawn with a needle, his mind was clear, but his pulse was rapid and obscure, pressing it felt faint as if absent. It was said: &quot;There is form but no pain, it resembles a yang condition, and thus one should strongly nourish the yin. But if one injures the yin blood, he is bound to perish.&quot; Subsequently, he indeed passed away. This case serves as a warning against careless use of blades or needles.</p>
<p>For throat wind conditions, the swelling penetrates outward, causing numbness, itching, and pain; in such cases, the antidote called xionghuang pills may be used. </p>
<p>An ancient method involves soaking paper in castor oil, twisting it into a wick, igniting it, then extinguishing it to create smoke that can be inhaled. Instantly, saliva will flow from the mouth and nose, and the jaw will relax, allowing for treatment directly at the afflicted area to ensure recovery.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>For those with yang deficiency and throat pain, there are sores on the mouth and tongue, and symptoms worsen with exertion. The pulse will be floating and large, indicating deficiency of both spleen and lung qi, along with virtual heat in the bladder. One should use the Li Zhong Decoction, adding yam and shan zhu yu for recovery. For wind-heat in the upper jiao, use Jing Fang Bai Du San.</p>
<p>In cases of swollen and painful throat, with thirst and preference for cold drinks, along with constipation, all six pulses will be full. Purging will bring about recovery; one can use Fang Feng Tong Sheng San. There are many cases of virtual heat in the world, but few of actual heat. Such symptoms are rare, and this method should not be used lightly.</p>
<p>In cases of sudden throat blockage with a sound like snoring and phlegm that feels like being sawed, this indicates a lung crisis. It requires the urgent use of ginseng paste combined with ginger juice and bamboo juice taken openly. If the paste is not available, first boil ginseng decoction for rescue. Taking it early yields 70 to 80% results, next 40 to 50%, and if delayed, it cannot save.</p>
<p>Dan Xi states: for swollen and painful throats with yin deficiency and excessive yang energy, phlegm builds up above, the pulse will surely be floating and large. If pressure is applied, it will be weak; to save one from death is close, thus ginseng alone should be boiled thick and sipped slowly. Treating it as a solid condition invites disaster.</p>
<p>Zhong Jing says: for throat pain with heat in the Shao Yin, use 甘草汤 (Gancao Decoction). For cold and heat clashing in the Shao Yin, use 桔梗汤 (Jiegeng Decoction). For cold-induced throat pain in the Shao Yin, use a combination of Ban Xia San and decoction. For throat injuries causing sores which prevent speech, apply bitter wine soup.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>For conditions of slight yin deficiency accompanied by guest heat, diarrhea, sore throat, fullness in the chest, and irritability, use Pigskin Decoction. People generally recognize heat associated with sore throats but are unaware of the existence of cold sore throats. The classics state: when the sun is at its zenith, cold dampness prevails, and people suffer from sore throats with swelling in the jaw. Chen Zangqi utilized prepared aconite peeled at the navel, sliced, and coated with honey, to allow the honey to penetrate the throat. The sweet taste diminishes, and it can be replaced. In the winter, cold accumulates in the kidney channel, leading to sore throats and diarrhea; aconite decoction warms the channel and thus provides relief. </p>
<p>Furthermore, during severe weather, if there are many cases of severe cold in the villages, it indicates violent exposure to cold, suppressing heat externally while trapping it internally. One must avoid using cold medicines like alum and sulfur to prevent further constricting yang energy. Also, avoid nitrate powder and other cold tonics, as these can push cold deep into the body, leading to serious consequences. Instead, one should use dispersing formulas, similar to Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Sweet Tangerine Decoction.</p>
<p>There are also cases of yang toxin sore throats treated with Shengma Decoction, and yin toxin sore throats treated with Licorice Decoction. If medications for the sore throat prove ineffective, this is not actually a throat issue but pertains to a single red thread that appears in the nose like hair, with a black bubble the size of a cherry dangling to the throat&#39;s entrance, preventing the intake of food and drink. In this case, use a straight and solitary root of ox knee, clean it thoroughly, and mix three to five drops of quality vinegar. Grind finely and apply two or three drops into the nostrils. This will sever the thread and burst the bubble, bringing immediate relief.</p>
<p>Should there be persistent pain in the throat with chronic sores that refuse to heal, this is likely due to Yumberry ulcerative toxin, which should be primarily treated with Bi Xie Decoction.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>Throat Closure Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The throat is the passageway for qi; when it is open, it is beneficial, but when it is blocked, it causes harm, regardless of its primary or secondary causes. Therefore, it requires urgent treatment. Now, if we examine the various teachings of the ancients, and draw connections accordingly, we find the vital means for saving lives emerge clearly.</p>
<p>For emergencies involving severe throat closure, the prescription of Xiong Huang Jie Du Wan is advised. This condition directly relates to life and death; urgent treatment results in survival, whereas delayed treatment leads to death. The herbs in this formula—Xiong Huang can break down stagnant qi, Ba Dou helps expel thick phlegm, and Yu Jin disperses stagnant blood—can effectively address this closure.</p>
<p>For those with throat closure lasting several days that prevents eating, Xie Yan San can induce vomiting to clear phlegm, and once the phlegm is expelled, the illness is resolved. The sharp properties of Zao Jiao can break down stagnant qi, while the salty and bitter nature of Bai Fan can promote the release of thick phlegm; repeated expulsion will lead to the resolution of the illness.</p>
<p>For throat pain, Gan Ju Fang Feng Tang is recommended. The sweetness of Gan Cao mitigates urgent sensations in the throat; the bitterness of Jie Geng helps lower qi in the throat; the spiciness of Fang Feng can disperse blockage in the throat.</p>
<p>For throats affected by wind, applying Ba Dou oil on paper, twisting it into a strip, igniting it, and extinguishing it immediately after smoke rises allows the patient to open their mouth and apply the smoky end to the throat. After a moment, the expulsion of dark blood will alleviate the symptoms, and the patient can then eat porridge and drink. This approach, where heat from the fire reaches the Ba Dou oil, disperses blockages with the fire, flushes with Ba Dou, and expels through smoke, is a comprehensive strategy for effective relief.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br><strong>External Medicine Authentic Text</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shigong (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>It is asked: Sore throat pertains to the lungs, yet its causes are varied, with distinctions such as虚火 (empty fire) and实火 (full fire), tight throat and slow throat. Additionally, the throat is the gateway for the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys for respiration, as well as the pathway for food, sound, and excretion. This connection affects the entire body and can be harmful quickly. Hence, it is said, &quot;Look at the throat of a running horse,&quot; without delay. </p>
<p>In cases of empty fire, the color is pale with slight swelling, the pulse is thin and fine, urination is clear, and bowel movements are smooth. This is due to excessive thinking, insufficient central qi, and the spleen being unable to protect adequately, leading to easy ascent of empty fire. The discomfort first manifests as dryness in the throat, hindering food intake, causing coughs with phlegm, and difficulty in breathing, resulting in a coating that resembles moss, similar to shrimp skin, often irritating the throat. It feels like a hard object lodged in the throat, leading to vomiting of sour fluids and spitting out sweet saliva. In severe cases, there is a white coating on the tongue, pale lips, hoarseness of voice, and frequent coughing with phlegm. </p>
<p>All these symptoms arise from insufficient vitality of empty fire, and in treating this, one should not hastily use cooling medicines. For morning pain, it relates to qi deficiency, treated with Qi-invigorating decoction modified with Mai Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Niu Bang, and Yuan Shen. For afternoon pain, it relates to yin deficiency, treated with Four Substance Decoction modified with Huang Lian, Zhi Mu, Jie Geng, and Yuan Shen. If these do not prove effective, ginger should be added to guide the treatment, serving as an auxiliary method as well.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>Real fire arises from excessive consumption of rich wine, indulging in fatty foods, piling up heavy bedding, and eating spicy and hot meals, leading to an accumulation of heat within. Over time, this stirs the fire and generates phlegm, resulting in a swollen throat. In severe cases, wind phlegm clogs it up, closing off the throat&#39;s entrance. Soon, fluids cannot enter, and the voice cannot be heard; this manifests as a tight throat and throat wind. If medication is ineffective, one should first use acupuncture to prick the throat, draining toxic blood. Then, applying tung oil with chicken feathers, one can induce the expulsion of thick phlegm, ensuring the phlegm and toxins are fully eliminated, allowing the throat entrance to relax so that soups and medicines can enter, and the voice can return. </p>
<p>For those who experience tightly clenched teeth that are hard to open, one must urgently pierce the minor seal to draw blood, which will cause the closure to open. If the needle probing does not expel phlegm and the voice sounds like a creaking saw while the nose lifts with phlegm and gasps, with fluids unable to enter and the voice silent, that indicates a true life-threatening condition. </p>
<p>There are also conditions such as throat carbuncles, throat paralysis, milk moth, and palatal abscesses. Although the afflicted may swell causing the throat entrance to be partially obstructed, the condition can still appear serious while the throat passage remains both wide and tight. These are all standard conditions, and although severe, they are manageable. One should use a golden key to expel phlegm and saliva, and administer a clearing broth to promote the release of accumulated heat. For pus swelling, it should be drained, what is damaged and painful should be nourished, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In general, failing to let blood release for a closed throat, not eliminating phlegm for throat wind, not draining pus for throat carbuncles, and not needling or cauterizing for throat paralysis or milk moth are all improper practices. Furthermore, cases of phlegm fire causing coughs, which injure the throat, cannot be treated successfully.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>The initial onset of red, swollen pain, with a clear voice and no simultaneous internal or external evidence, is mild. Once it has become swollen and painful, with the throat half open and half closed, and there is slight expectoration of phlegm, along with some intake of food, it is manageable. If the throat is swollen and closed, with a tight jaw, unclear speech, phlegm obstructing airflow, and a weak voice, it is dangerous. If the throat is suddenly closed, phlegm and saliva are obstructing, the mouth cannot open, and there is difficulty in breathing, it is fatal. Following sores, if toxicity accumulates in the throat leading to swelling, pain, and decay, making breathing unbearable and the voice hoarse, it is serious. Chronic cough due to phlegm heat, with deficiency of Yang rising, causing injury to the throat, results in hoarseness and a red face, which is also fatal.</p>
<p>Treatment methods:<br>For initial swelling and pain, with alternating cold and heat, along with dizziness and tightness, the evil is exterior and should be dispersed. If swelling and pain are accompanied by heat and a strong pulse with constipation, it indicates an internal evil and should be purged. For swelling and pain with cold and heat, dry mouth and intense thirst, and a large, strong pulse, it is advisable to both release the exterior and purge from within. When there is swelling and pain in the throat with significant phlegm obstruction, a flushed face and dry mouth indicate the evil is above, thus, it should be expelled. For a closed throat with phlegm, obstructing airflow and difficulty opening the mouth, first puncture the Shaoshang point and then proceed with expulsion. If there is already swelling and pain, with throat obstruction and inability to ingest liquids, and pus has formed, it requires urgent needling. If the swelling and pain are slightly red, with a weak pulse, and pain occurs in the afternoon, it indicates Yin deficiency and should nourish Yin and reduce fire; if the swelling and pain are white, with excessive expectoration in the morning, suggesting Yang deficiency, then the treatment should strengthen the spleen and tonify the middle.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p>
<h3>Throat Abscess</h3>
<p>The throat abscess arises outside the pharynx, with swelling and pain in the center, hindering eating and drinking, with redness, swelling, and heat, requiring drainage of pus. If it is soft and painful, needling is indicated; internally take tonifying medication, and apply jade-red ointment to help heal and close the mouth. In cases of internal erosion with fluids oozing from the hole, treatment has been effective for several individuals, and it is harmless.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>In ancient texts, the condition of throat obstruction is distinguished into eighteen types, all being categorized as &quot;yang fire&quot; by ancient scholars. However, although many of these patterns arise from fire, some do not originate from fire and must be examined closely. Fire can be true or false; true fire symptoms can be cleared, while false fire symptoms cannot be cleared and indicate water deficiency. Furthermore, there can be cases of excessive yin obstructing yang, indicating true cold symptoms. Therefore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;The sun at the spring, cold dominance leads to pain in the throat and swelling of the jaw.&quot; This is precisely the meaning; why do later generations not investigate this? The throat obstruction involves various channels, including lesser yang, yangming, jueyin, and shaoyin, each with different manifestations of deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>The organs related to the Lesser Yang and Jueyin, being associated with wood and fire, indeed often manifest heat conditions. The Yangming, as the sea of food and water, allows the stomach qi to directly reach the throat, thus the fire of Yangming becomes the most abundant. To discern this, one only needs to observe that when emotional disturbances arise from frustration and anger, they mostly belong to the Lesser Yang and Jueyin, whereas those resulting from excessive consumption of rich, sweet, and spicy foods typically pertain to Yangming. For those suffering from this, it is generally appropriate to treat according to the principle of full fire.</p>
<p>As for the conditions related to the Lesser Yin, they are not comparable to these. The pulse of the Lesser Yin runs along the transverse bones, ending at the epiglottis, and is connected to the root of the tongue. When the Yin fire rises and causes a reverse flow upward, it often leads to throat obstruction. However, the fire of the Lesser Yin can either be empty or full and should not simply be classified as fire. If it indeed arises from full fire, there will be corresponding fire symptoms and clear pulse manifestations, which are also easy to identify. Conversely, if it is caused by excessive indulgence in alcohol and sexuality, leading to true Yin deficiency, this indicates a deficiency fire in the kidneys, and it cannot be supported by strong water.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>There is a vacuous fire below that clashes with the Yang above; this is the fire without a root, namely the true cold condition in the kidneys, which cannot be treated without warming and supplementing the life gate. Although these various scriptures differ significantly, the differences between deficiency and excess are rarely understood by later generations. Only the &quot;Chushi Yishu&quot; discusses the examination of the upper conditions in relation to the lower, which indeed reflects the words of the Dao.</p>
<p>The conditions of the throat are generally referred to as fire; though there are many terms, some do not require precise distinction, yet there are others that must be differentiated. For instance, the single and double breast swellings and the throat wind are different. The swelling on both sides of the throat is called double breast swelling, while swelling on one side is called single breast swelling. Their shape must be round and protruding like a pearl, and they belong to the category of abscesses that form in the throat; therefore, they often release toxins and may require lancing to expel the blood for recovery.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>If there is a wind that constricts the throat, the area will become red and swollen, not often purulent, and it need not bleed. Just reduce the heat, and the swelling will subside on its own. This is why the conditions differ, and there should be a proper method of treatment. </p>
<p>Pang said: The disease caused by repressed qi, in ancient texts, is referred to as kidney cold damage. This refers to those who have been suddenly exposed to intense cold, causing toxic qi to become trapped in the Shaoyin channel. Initially, there may be no illness, but after a period of ten days or months, symptoms may arise, with a faint pulse. The approach should be to treat it like cold damage, not as a throat blockage disease. </p>
<p>Next, there will likely be diarrhea. In my humble opinion, this symptom commonly occurs. It is necessary to utilize the fire of the Shaoyin and Shaoyang, along with the cold influence of the Taiyang and the dampness of the Taiyin, compounded with the evil of wind and cold, all of which can bring about this condition. Therefore, when treating this, there’s no need to specifically address the throat blockage; instead, focus on expelling the external evil, and the throat will heal on its own. For instance, many formulas containing Chai Hu and various scattered methods can be adjusted accordingly for use.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p>
<h3>On Treatment</h3>
<p>For fire-related throat obstruction, it is best to focus on drinking a decoction aimed at resolving it; if the fire is not severe, a shift in the decoction can help. When there is excess liver and gallbladder fire, the main ingredients should be peony, gardenia, and gentian. For excess stomach fire, gypsum should be the primary ingredient. If there is severe constipation, larger doses of rhubarb and Glauber&#39;s salt should be added to relieve the bowel and reduce the fire naturally. If the fire rises to the upper body and causes heat to accumulate in the head, face, and throat, it is crucial to clear and descend it; never use remedies to disperse wind or raise yang, as this will only cause the fire to further flare up from within. As the classics state, &quot;Suppress the high,&quot; which refers directly to this situation; it does not mean that obstructed fire should be released or that raising yang is needed. Scholars must discern this clearly and not mistake its essence.</p>
<p>Regarding external treatment for fire-related swelling and pain, it is best to grind the seeds of the bitter cucumber with vinegar, then use a goose quill to swab the throat to remove phlegm; alternatively, dilute it with some water to avoid excessive acidity, and periodically gargle without swallowing, expelling phlegm for better results. After gargling, use a spoon to blow the decoction, and still take the herbal medicine internally for guaranteed recovery. If the fire is trapped above, food remedies like snow pear juice or mung bean drinks are ideal. In regions where pears are scarce, good radish juice can be pounded and mixed with spring water, adding a little starch to blend it, and sipped slowly; this will both eliminate phlegm and clear heat.</p>
<p>For cases involving single or double moth larvae, if the toxicity is mild and there is no formation of pus, treatment can help disperse it; if the condition is severe and critical, it is essential to perform bloodletting to hasten recovery.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>This is due to urgency and thus cannot be helped but must be used. Furthermore, in ancient practices, using a three-edged needle to puncture the Shaoshang point to induce bleeding is said to treat throat obstruction and achieve immediate relief. </p>
<p>For throat obstruction due to Yin deficiency, symptoms include internal heat, thirst, dryness of the throat, and possibly red lips and flushed cheeks, with phlegm and saliva accumulating. However, the pulse must be weak, and although the six pulses may be rapid, they feel floating and soft with no strength. One should observe if there has been excessive indulgence in alcohol or erotic desires, or if the individual is naturally deficient in Yin energy, experiencing fatigue and weakness. This indicates a deficiency in kidney Yin, where water fails to restrain fire. When fire is severe, it is advised to use the Eight Ingredients Decoction for nourishing Yin, or modifications of the One Yin Decoction. If there is mild fire, a dislike for cold substances, soft stools, and urine that is not hot, then the Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Decoction or similar preparations should be applied. If caused by excessive worry and mental strain alongside active heart fire, the Two Yin Decoction should be used.</p>
<p>For throat obstruction due to Yang inversion, if the fire does not return to its source, the fire becomes a guest in the throat, leading to symptoms of heat above and cold below, distinctly different from typical fire patterns. In such cases, one should only find the six pulses weak, without a slippery or strong indication; moreover, there are no fire symptoms in the lower body and the abdomen dislikes cold. These signs typically arise from indulgence in lust harming essence, excessive diarrhea damaging the kidneys, or the absence of real fire combined with excessive consumption of cold substances which harms Yang energy. For this condition, urgent use of the Tranquil Yin Decoction is recommended, followed by the Eight-Ingredient Rehmannia Decoction; alternatively, dissolving honey with Aconite in the mouth is also effective. If further cold is employed, it will certainly lead to dire consequences.</p>
<p>Throat obstruction due to Yang deficiency does not arise from a throat issue caused by Yang deficiency; rather, it is throat obstruction stemming from pre-existing Yang deficiency.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>There are those whose throat ailments are caused by excessive aggression, resulting in harm to the stomach&#39;s energy; some struggle with food and drink, leading to empty storerooms, which also harms the stomach&#39;s energy; and there are others whose energy is inherently weak, and who cannot withstand fatigue, causing harm to the stomach&#39;s energy. Generally, when there is inner deficiency of middle energy and external pressure causing pain, it often results in the departure of original yang, with a floating and scattered pulse, or a weak and thin pulse, leading to a snoring-like sound and sputum as if being cut with a saw. This indicates a severe depletion of the lungs and stomach, and one should promptly restore the original energy by simmering ginseng alone, and sip it slowly with peace of mind; if there is excessive phlegm, bamboo juice or ginger juice may be added. If the remedy is delayed, there may be dire consequences; treating it with approaches for excess heat will bring disaster as quickly as a snap of the fingers.</p>
<p>For throat ulcer conditions, those who are generally weakened from yin deficiency often suffer from this illness; the symptoms include swollen and ulcerated throats that fail to heal over long periods. This is a case of substantial water deficiency and latent fire, and should be treated using methods for yin deficiency and throat ailments. If there is frequent coughing due to lung heat, the treatment should involve preparations like Si Yin Decoction. In cases where there are ulcers in the throat that are painful and broken, it is advisable to use Niuhuang Yijing Powder for blowing and applying, while also internally taking nourishing agents for true yin to facilitate complete recovery.</p>
<p>Plague-induced throat ailments arise from the atmospheric plague&#39;s influence, presenting with throat pain and swelling of the neck, particularly severe swelling of the head and face, especially in the northern regions. This illness is commonly referred to as &quot;toad plague&quot; among the people, or also called &quot;cormorant plague&quot; and &quot;big head plague.&quot; This condition, characterized by extreme dampness and heat, is most dangerous, and one should clear the accumulated heat from all meridians, or drain the heat of the Yangming channel, taking care to assess urgency in treatment. Dongyuan has a remedy called Pujixiaodong Decoction, specifically for treating plague-related throat ailments, which is highly effective.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>The condition known as &quot;Locked Throat Wind&quot; is often identified by symptoms such as swelling and pain in the throat, difficulty in eating and drinking, or phlegm and gas obstructing the passage, all of which are referred to as &quot;Locked Throat Wind.&quot; However, what truly constitutes Locked Throat Wind is exceedingly strange and urgent, and little is known about it. </p>
<p>While in Yandu, I once encountered a girl who had reached the age of maturity. One day in mid-autumn, she suddenly developed a tight and constricted throat without any preceding illness, and her breathing became labored. Within half a day, her condition worsened significantly. When I was called to treat her, I examined her pulse and found no sign of heat. When I asked about her throat, there was neither swelling nor pain. Observing her appearance, her face was pale and her eyes wide, unable to speak. Listening to her voice, it was as delicate as a needle, and her attempts to breathe were desperate like a thread; she strained her neck as if fighting for her life, in a state of pitiable distress. I was left in doubt, unable to comprehend the situation.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>The intention is to indicate that the wind pathogen obstructs the throat passages; it cannot be resolved without using pungent and warming herbs. Thus, I added fresh ginger to Erchen Decoction, brewed it, and administered it, but there was no effect at all. I intended to use Dushen Decoction to save the lungs; however, seeing the condition so dire, I feared it would stir grievances and slander, and I ultimately did not dare to take action. Other physicians, upon seeing this, could only stand by without taking any measures. In this way, one person passed away after a day and night. Subsequently, another person met the same fate. As for these two individuals, I still do not understand the cause of their illness, which remains a lifelong perplexity, and I feel deeply ashamed. Nevertheless, it must be that the lung qi was completely exhausted. If another case arises, I fear that Dushen Decoction alone cannot provide salvation. Therefore, I record this here, hoping that future gentlemen will take it to heart and consider it carefully.</p>
<p>When there is poison from the Yangmei fruit causing ulceration and pain in the throat that does not heal after a long time, this is not a case of throat blockage, but rather a Yangmei sore toxin. One should use Xianyi Liang Decoction; in severe cases, prepare a decoction of earth Poria and swallow Wubao Pill. </p>
<p><strong>Shishis Secret Manuscript</strong> 【Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo】<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p>
<h3>Swelling and Pain</h3>
<p>When a person has a throat condition with significant swelling, which is neither a goiter nor a tumor, the pain may come and go. Externally, there are colorful patterns visible, and when pressed, it feels both empty and solid. This is due to phlegm disease that manifests like a tumor but is neither truly one nor a goiter. The prescription consists of 9 grams each of seaweed, banxia (Pinellia), white mustard seed, fritillaria, ginseng, platycodon (bellflower), and nanking (south stars), 15 grams of poria, 3 grams each of kelp and licorice, and 0.3 grams of aconite, decocted in water for oral administration. This formula is a miraculous medicine to dissolve phlegm in the upper burner. Seaweed and kelp help remove external signs of the goiter and eliminate the strange colorful patterns. The key is to resolve phlegm without damaging qi, thereby keeping the stomach qi strong and facilitating the transformation of phlegm. With one dose, one knows; two doses can eliminate most of it; three doses can completely dissolve it; and four doses will prevent recurrence. This formula can also treat goiter symptoms and is remarkably effective.</p>
<p>If a person suddenly has swelling and pain in the throat, accompanied by double eyelids, such that they cannot eat, they could die within five days without food. However, this condition of real fire is easier to treat. For real fire, one can use mountain bean root, and herbs like qin (skullcap), lian (lotus), banxia, chaihu (bupleurum), licorice, platycodon, and tianhuafeng (trichosanthes) for immediate relief. Yet, the condition of false fire occurs when kidney fire does not settle in the mingmen (life gate) but floats between the throat. Its symptoms resemble those of real fire, but are heavier at night and lighter in the morning. Conversely, with real fire, symptoms are heavier in the morning and lighter at night. Real fire causes dryness and cracking in the mouth; false fire does not create much thirst but shows a slippery tongue without cracks. Use this method of distinguishing symptoms to avoid mistakes.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>These虚痛s (false pains), if treated with methods meant for real fire, are like a person who has fallen into a well and then adds stones to it. Therefore, not only should one avoid cold and cooling treatments, but one should also refrain from using dispersing methods, as虚火 (false fire) must be supplemented. However, merely supplementing kidney water, while water can control fire, may only alleviate the situation slightly, as the fire is too intense and hard to subdue. It is better to supplement fire with water, leading the fire back to its original source, causing its force to vanish in an instant. One should use the Y引火 Decoction: prepared Rehmannia and Fritillaria (each 1 tael), white mustard seed (3 qian), Chinese dogwood and yam (each 4 qian), northern spices and cinnamon (each 2 qian), poria (5 qian), then decoct with water and take as a dose, which will calm the phlegm, relieve the pain, and eliminate the swelling; two doses will bring complete recovery. The prepared Rehmannia, Chinese dogwood, and spices primarily reinforce kidney water; poria and yam also benefit essence and facilitate water, assisting the descent of cinnamon; Fritillaria dissipates the floating fire above; while white mustard seeds eliminate obstructive phlegm. Once the upper focus is relaxed and the lower focus receives the warmth of cinnamon, is there any chance that the fire of the dragon and thunder will not return to its root in the mingmen? One dose is effective. The unpredictable workings of spirits and ghosts are even better than the Eight-Flavored Rehmannia Decoction. If the throat is swollen and blocked, and not even a spoonful of water can be swallowed, how will this formula be applied? Furthermore, there is another method: use one piece of aconite, five qian of broken old paper, ground into powder, mix into a paste, shape it into a patch as large as a teacup, apply it to the center of the sole, and warm it with fire for a while. After one period, the throat will widen, opening a pathway to take medicine.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br><strong>Moth of Milk</strong></p>
<p>There are some who suffer from a dual moth condition, which others mistakenly attribute to heat. The throat swells painfully, phlegm incessantly thick like sawdust, and not a single drop of tea can be swallowed. Isn’t this a sign of heat? Yet, despite the intense pain, it becomes somewhat lighter by morning; although the throat is swollen, the tongue will not be dry; although there is abundant phlegm, it will not be yellow and clotted. This is a sign of false heat. If one hastily uses cold and cool medicines for urgent relief, it may seem to soothe the throat momentarily, but soon the heat intensifies even more. People assume that the cooling medicine was insufficient and add more cold remedies, which only aggravates the condition. It is urgent to prick the Shaoshang point to draw a little blood; this will surely open a line of passage in the throat. It is essential to use one qian of Aconite, one liang of Rehmannia, four qian of Cornus, three qian each of Ophiopogon, Chinese Amomum, and Achyranthes, and five qian of Poria; decoct and administer down the throat, and a sound shall resonate, causing the fiery heat to dissipate immediately.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>The fire of the Lesser Yin is like a galloping horse. When a person loses a significant amount of kidney water, the original Yang in the kidneys cannot settle down, as there is no water to nourish the fire, which must then rise. Daily, it surges upward and constricts the throat, making it unable to properly function, leading to swellings and pains resembling double moths, though they are not actually double moths. The key lies in using spicy and warm drugs like aconite to guide the fire of the dragon and thunder down into the dwelling. The fire of the dragon and thunder represents the fire of the heart; it enjoys water but dislikes fire. Therefore, herbs like cooked rehmannia and shan zhu yu, which are purely nourishing for Yin, are used to give the fire a place to return, preventing it from boiling over. This is due to counteracting its reverse tendencies. What it enjoys is the true Yin water, not the cold and cooling type; what it dislikes is the fire of邪气 (xieqi), not the spicy and warm fire. As for the condition of having heavier days and lighter nights, it is the easiest to treat.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>Using three qian of mountain bean root and balloon flower, and one qian each of pinellia and licorice, a single dose will cure immediately, provided it is not a case of reverse syndrome. For the symptoms of dual moths with yin deficiency, there are additional methods of treatment. Use one qian of aconite, fried with salt water into pieces; hold one piece in the mouth to immediately enable the use of decoction. Then, take one liang of Eight Flavor Pill with boiling water, and it can also cure immediately. </p>
<p>Moreover, the yin syndrome of dual moths is both the most difficult and the easiest to treat. Not knowing the key makes it very hard, but knowing the method makes it very easy. I often treat this illness using one piece of aconite, with one he of salt, boiled in water until thoroughly cooked, allowing the patient to hold one piece in the mouth, after which the fire will stop; then, take a large dose of Six Flavor Decoction, and it will not recur—this is a divine formula.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>The condition of the &quot;yin moth&quot; is due to a deficiency of kidney water, where the fire cannot be contained below and thus rises above. The throat is narrow, preventing the fire from being released directly, resulting in the formation of a &quot;moth,&quot; which resembles a moth but is not. The pain is lighter in the morning and heavier in the afternoon, exacerbating by dusk. It is relieved by heat and worsened by coolness. In severe cases, even a drop of water cannot go down the throat. If treated as an external wind-heat condition using herbs like mountain soy root, qin (scutellaria), lian (lotus), and gardenia, the pain may increase and the throat will remain obstructed, potentially leading to death. Only by nourishing the yin deficiency and employing methods that redirect fire to its source can the pain be alleviated. This is known as the &quot;Transforming Moth Pill,&quot; consisting of one liang each of reheated land (shudihuang), shanzhu yu (cornelian cherry), and mai dong (ophiopogon), along with 1 qian of fu zi (prepared aconite) and 3 qians of che qian zi (plantago) and 2 qians of bei wu wei zi (schisandra). These ingredients are decocted in water for ingestion. This formula greatly nourishes the kidney water, rather than treating the pain of the &quot;moth.&quot; Strengthening the water will quell the fire; thus, the pain dissipates, making this method exceptionally effective.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br><strong>Throat Gateway</strong></p>

Additionally, puncture the tip of the little finger to draw blood, and it will take effect immediately. The &quot;Eastern Garden Ten Books&quot; states: for throat closure, puncture the Shaoyang Jing points on the hands and feet, namely Guanchong and Qiaoyin. In cases of throat closure with a milky moth, use the Shaoshang point, inserting the needle one depth and keeping it prone at a backward angle of three depth; also needle Zhaohai and Taichong. The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; mentions that for throat closure, needle Shaoshang, Hegu, and Chize. For long-term throat obstruction, men treat the left side and women the right, applying moxibustion to the first segment of the thumb nail three times. The &quot;Effective Recipe&quot; states that if the throat remains closed, needling the Yangling point will result in immediate healing. For chronic throat issues, moxibustion should be applied seven times to a point half an inch below the earlobe and near the zygomatic bone, with two sets of seven being especially effective.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>For sore throat and swelling, needle Fengfu, which is effective for all diseases of the throat and conditions such as toxic qi returning to the heart. Additionally, needle Shàoshāng, which treats sore and swollen throat. Furthermore, needle Hégǔ and Shàngxīng to treat swelling of the cheeks and wind affecting the throat. Also, needle Zú Sānlǐ.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states that the acupuncture methods for throat obstruction from the &quot;Internal Canon&quot; have two types: one based on the meridians passing through the throat and the other relating to other diseases that cause throat obstruction, encompassing the six meridians. The first involves the hand and foot Yangming meridians. It specifies that for throat obstruction preventing speech, one should needle the foot Yangming, and if speech is possible, needle the hand Yangming. It further states that the Stomach Meridian of the Foot Yangming runs from Dàyíng in front to Rénjīng, circling the throat; the resulting diseases include swelling in the neck and throat obstruction, requiring treatment based on the conditions of excess, deficiency, heat, and cold. Another mention is that the branch of the Foot Yangming, known as Fēnglóng, is located eight cun above the ankle, diverging to the Taiyin; if the pathogenic qi reverses, it leads to acute throat obstruction and muteness, requiring treatment at this branch point.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>It is also said: The hand Yangming channel of the large intestine causes illnesses such as throat obstruction, from excessive heat or cold descending. </p>
<p>Secondly: For the hand Shaoyang, the classic states: The Sanjiao hand Shaoyang channel emerges above the clavicle, connecting behind the ear. When it is disturbed, it causes throat swelling and obstruction, from excessive heat or cold descending. It is further stated: When evil influences invade the hand Shaoyang collaterals, they cause throat obstruction. To treat this, needle the nails of the middle and index fingers, taking care to insert the needle as deep as a garlic leaf, with immediate effect in robust individuals, and delayed effect in the elderly. Treat the left side for the right side, and the right side for the left side.</p>
<p>Thirdly: The channels that pass through the throat are two. The classic states: The liver meridian of the foot Jueyin runs behind the throat, hence when there is pain behind the throat, this is the corresponding point. It also states: The kidney meridian of the foot Shaoyin traverses the diaphragm of the liver and runs along the throat.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>What Dou Hanqing refers to as &quot;必准&quot; (must be accurate) pertains to addressing the blockage in the throat. </p>
<p>Fourthly: There is a condition where other diseases cause throat paralysis. The classic text states: When the heart coughs, the throat feels tight and obstructed, and in severe cases it leads to swelling and paralysis of the throat. To treat this, one should stimulate the heart&#39;s associated point, which is the Daling point.</p>
<p>For treating throat paralysis, use Fenglong, Yongquan, and Guanchong. In severe cases, utilize a small three-edged needle alongside a writing brush to simulate applying medication directly to the paralyzed throat, then puncture to release purple blood immediately for recovery.</p>
<p>For throat blockage, use Shaoshang, Yinbai, Shaochong, and Yongquan.</p>
<p>In cases of throat paralysis, if the jaw swells like a surge and water cannot be swallowed: stimulate the Shaoshang to cause bleeding; on the back of the big toe, at the last joint, apply three punctures with a three-edged needle to draw blood; and at Yanggu, puncture three times.</p>
<p>For throat paralysis, needle the Shaoyin point, located at the wrist along the artery behind the little finger. Insert the needle three times and supplement.</p>
<p>According to the Inner Canon, there are two moxibustion and acupuncture methods for throat swellings and pains. The first involves using the foot Shaoyin point.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>The classic text states: The kidney channel corresponds to the lesser yin; the illnesses it causes are swelling of the throat, difficulty breathing, and pain in the throat. It also says: If there is swelling in the throat that cannot be ingested, and saliva cannot be expelled, one should puncture just before the bone to draw blood, which will immediately relieve the condition. Puncture the left side for the right side, and the right side for the left. Furthermore, it says: When evil energies affect the collateral of the lesser yin, it causes throat pain that makes it impossible to eat, anger without reason, and the upward flow of qi troubling the throat. Puncture centrally beneath the feet three times for a total of six punctures, which will immediately alleviate the condition. Puncture the left for the right, and the right for the left. </p>
<p>Secondly, one should access the hand taiyang. The classic states: The small intestine channel of the hand taiyang causes throat pain and swelling of the jaw if it is influenced by movement, which can be examined for its presence of deficiency or excess, cold or heat, and treated accordingly. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions moxibustion and puncturing the throat, specifically noting two techniques. The first technique involves accessing the Yanglingquan. It states: For those with gallbladder disease, who sigh frequently, experience a bitter mouth, vomit residual bile, and have a thick sensation in the throat resulting in frequent saliva secretion, one should access the Yanglingquan. This is the first technique. The second technique involves accessing the Daling.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>The scriptures say: The condition of heart cough manifests as a throaty sensation, feeling like a blockage. This indicates the need to treat the heart&#39;s corresponding acupoint. The &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states: When there is an accumulation of fire, one should induce bleeding through acupuncture, which is the same principle as sweating. The more blood is drawn, the better the recovery. For those with needle sores, ginger juice mixed with warm water should be sipped frequently. Generally, for blood blisters caused by tightness in the joints, it is most effective to use needles; for those not visible, have the patient hold water in their mouth and use a reed to prick the nostril to induce bleeding, which is quite effective.</p>
<p>The &quot;Examination of Medical Formulas&quot; mentions: In the case of acute throat obstruction, needle the area just outside the nail of the patient’s thumb, approximately the size of a chives leaf, with men on the left and women on the right—bleeding indicates effectiveness. If the situation is critical, needle both thumbs, which will yield prompt results. The throat is connected to the lungs, and the acupuncture point is Shaoshang, which is a lung aperture; hence, bleeding leads to recovery.</p>
<p>If the throat appears red and swollen, needle from the side to induce bleeding for recovery. It is essential to avoid piercing the Yamen point, as it could cause a loss of voice.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Collection&quot; states: To treat throat obstruction, have the patient bend their thumb at the second joint and keep it curled, then open their mouth and bite firmly. This will facilitate the flow of qi, disperse the blood vessels, and the swelling will subside. The &quot;Key Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; suggests that for throat wind, one can push on the affected area to clear the lung meridian and then breathe in while blowing out.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; in Hua Tuo&#39;s biography states: Tuo once traveled and saw someone suffering from a blocked throat. He told them: &quot;There used to be a pancake seller by the roadside whose pancakes were very sour; you can take three liters of his drink, and your ailment will surely disappear.&quot; Just as Tuo said, the patient immediately vomited a snake and then hung it on the cart to wait for Tuo. At that time, Tuo&#39;s young son was playing by the door and, seeing the situation, remarked to himself: &quot;There must be something by the guest&#39;s cart; it must be my grandfather.&quot; When the guest approached and looked, he saw a snake hanging on the wall, and realized its peculiarity.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br>The &quot;Rituals of Filial Piety&quot; states: A woman fell ill with a swollen and obstructed throat, unable to swallow gruel or porridge. For several days, the swelling did not subside, and medicine was difficult to take while acupuncture was ineffective. A person suggested using angelica, schizonepeta, and licorice decocted in hot water for gargling, and cooling water to treat her hands. Within five or six days, the pain lessened and the swelling disappeared, allowing her to eat and drink as usual. Throat ailments are very urgent and should not be treated recklessly with needles or medicines.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasure Mirror of Health&quot; mentions: A son of the Liang family, due to damage from excessive heat and dampness, suffered from overflowing heart fire affecting the lungs. Therefore, mulberry root and earth bone bark, which are slightly bitter and cool, were used to lower the internal fire in the lungs and replenish energy, serving as the chief remedy. Huangqin and Zhimu, both bitter and cold, were used to treat the foul, fishy breath and clear the lung qi, acting as the minister. To gather lung qi, it is urgent to consume sour foods; the sourness of Schisandra helps gather lung qi, while Mai Men Dong is sweet, bitter, and cool, treating thick, sticky phlegm and dryness in the mouth and tongue, serving as an assistant. Platycodon, light, acrid, and warm, treats phlegm reversal and benefits the throat, serving as a messager. In the spring of the Wucheng year, many in the village suffered from throat paralysis, likely due to the invasion of the qi at the end of the previous year and the beginning of this year, which brought about the dual fire evils. A sweet orange decoction was used, adding Huangqin, Lian, Banxia, Jangcan, Shucanzizi, and Pueraria to dispel it. For those who were weak, ginseng, astragalus, and angelica were added. When water and gruel could not enter, a detoxifying wax gourd pill was first used, administered as a liquid; after phlegm was expelled, ginger juice was given. None who took the previous medicine failed to see remarkable results. However, if cold, sour substances were used excessively, they would be ineffective, as the evil would be trapped and unable to be released.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>&quot;The Miraculous Remedies&quot; states: Yang Lizhi, returning to Chuzhou from his post in Guangfu, developed an abscess in his throat, which grew swollen and then burst, causing pus and blood to flow continuously both day and night. He could neither eat nor sleep, and the physicians were at a loss for how to treat him. Coincidentally, Elder Yang Ji was summoned by the governor, and Lizhi&#39;s two sons hurriedly went to invite him. Upon arriving, he looked carefully for a long time and said, “There is no need to take the pulse; I already know what it is. However, this illness is quite peculiar; you must first consume one pound of fresh ginger slices before any medication can be administered. Otherwise, there is no other way.” After saying this, he left. The sons had difficulty accepting this advice and said, “How can we eat fresh ginger when there is pus and pain in the throat?” Lizhi replied, “Elder Ji’s medical knowledge is profound, and his words are not in vain; try taking a slice and see if you can swallow it. If not, then it won’t cause harm to stop altogether.” They then consumed the ginger, finding it surprisingly sweet and fragrant. They gradually increased the amount to about half a pound, and the pain began to ease. Once they consumed a full pound, they finally felt a spicy taste, and the pus and blood ceased immediately. They could drink congee without any obstruction. The next day, they invited Elder Ji to thank him and inquire further. He responded, “You live in the south and often eat partridges. This bird likes to eat pinellia, which can be toxic over time, hence the use of ginger to counter it. Now that the source of the illness has been cleared, there is no need for other medications.” One son recalled that in a Tang dynasty novel, it was recorded that Duke Cui Wei suffered from a similar ailment, and a physician named Liang Xin diagnosed it as food poisoning. When asked what he had eaten, he said he often enjoyed bamboo chicken, which tends to eat pinellia sprouts, and this was likely the source of the toxin. The physician then ordered ginger juice to be mixed and administered to him, resulting in recovery. This case is indeed similar to that.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: Sun Yapban treated Pan Yuan, who was choking. Sun used half a coin&#39;s worth of medicine and blew it into his throat. After a moment, Pan coughed up pus and blood and was immediately healed. Pan visited Sun to express his gratitude, saying: &quot;This was a matter of great urgency, and without your esteemed self, I could not have been saved. In urgent situations, it is not medicine that can heal but a skilled hand.&quot; He offered a reward of one hundred taels of silver and requested the formula to help with emergencies. Sun replied: &quot;Use equal parts of pig&#39;s tooth, soapwort, and alum, place them on a new tile, and roast them dry to make a powder.&quot; After giving him the formula, he did not accept the offered reward.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>&quot;The Medical Case Records of Xue Ji&quot; states: </p>
<p>Tong Fu Li Chao experienced sore throat and mouth sores. This was due to wind-heat in the upper jiao. He first used two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du, and his throat pain gradually improved; then with the use of Yuan Shen Sheng Ma Decoction, his mouth and tongue healed completely.</p>
<p>Di Guan Huang Bei had a sore throat, excessive thirst, and constipation. This indicated heat in both the upper and lower regions. He was treated with Fang Feng Tong Sheng Powder and recovered quickly.</p>
<p>A man had a swollen sore throat, and I wanted to use acupuncture to release the poison; however, he feared needles and only took medicine. Eventually, he could not swallow even cooked food. I quickly performed acupuncture at the affected area to draw out toxic blood and then gave him a cleansing medicine for the throat, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Di Guan Hu Cheng Fu had a dry throat and pain, indicating deficiency-heat in the kidney and bladder pathways. I used Si Wu Decoction with additions of Huang Lian, Zhi Mu, and Yuan Shen. After four doses, he had slight improvement; then, with one dose of Ren Shen Gu Ben Pill, he did not relapse.</p>
<p>Zhi Fang Lu Yi Zhai had a swollen sore throat, blurry vision, and reddish, cloudy urine. This indicated damp-heat in the bladder. He was treated with Si Ling Powder plus Huang Lian, Zhi Mu, Yin Chen, and Fang Ji, and recovered quickly; later he also took Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to fully heal.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>A Confucian scholar, Wang Wenyuan, had a sore throat and ulcers in his mouth, which worsened with exertion. I diagnosed a deficiency in spleen and lung qi, with heat in the bladder. I prescribed a formula to tonify the middle and benefit qi, adding codonopsis, pan-roasted black phellodendron, and anemarrhena; upon slight improvement, I removed the phellodendron and anemarrhena, adding shan zhu and yam, resulting in complete recovery.</p>
<p>Another scholar, over fifty years old, experienced throat pain. Taking cooling medicine or overexertion exacerbated the pain, indicating deficiency of middle qi and heat. I prescribed a formula to tonify the middle and benefit qi, adding pan-roasted black scutellaria and bulbus, and he recovered after four doses; I then removed the scutellaria and bulbus, and after several more doses, he fully healed.</p>
<p>A scholarly gentleman found that when his feet felt hot, his throat would start to hurt, accompanied by internal heat, dry mouth, and phlegm rising. This indicated kidney deficiency with excess heat. I prescribed a formula to tonify the middle and benefit qi, adding wheat husk and five-flavor fruit, using a modified Eight Flavor Pill, which led to complete recovery.</p>
<p>An elderly man suffered from a sore throat and frequent, red urination, which worsened in the afternoon. This was indicative of bladder yin deficiency. I aimed to nourish the source, using a formula to tonify the middle and benefit qi, adding pan-roasted black phellodendron and anemarrhena. After four doses, his throat pain improved; I then removed the two components and added shan zhu, yam, wheat husk, and five-flavor fruit, resulting in immediate recovery.</p>
<p>A gentleman had throat swelling and was unable to swallow medication. Acupuncture at the painful area caused purple blood to emerge, and he felt slightly better. Using Po Guandan to dissolve, I then prescribed a clear throat and promote diaphragm formula, leading to prompt recovery.</p>
<p>A gentleman who regularly drank alcohol experienced throat pain, internal heat with thirst, and difficulty urinating, while his appetite remained normal. This indicated accumulated heat in the bladder. I prescribed a formula based on the Four Ling Decoction, adding yin chen and rhubarb. After four doses, his symptoms gradually receded, and I then provided a heart-clearing lotus seed drink for his comfort.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>A certain astrological scholar, exhausted and entering a room, felt his throat tightening with pain, phlegm rising, and his limbs suddenly becoming hot. This indicated a deficiency of yin with the upward excitement of yang. I prescribed a decoction of Ba-zhen Tang (Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction) with the addition of Fu Zi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In the winter of the Gui-Mao year, the Vice Minister Jiang Shichuan consulted me. His pulse was floating and slightly strong at the right inch, and he had sores in his mouth. I said, &quot;This is stomach fire affecting the lungs. You should have a light diet and be careful with your daily activities.&quot; In the autumn of the Jia-Chen year, he consulted me again, and his pulse at the chi position was flooding and rapid yet without strength. I said, &quot;This indicates that the lung metal cannot generate kidney water; you need to rest to nourish the source of transformation.&quot; He complained of dryness and pain in his throat and ears, and his limbs occasionally felt hot, saying that if there were a fire without root, his demise was certain. Later, he mentioned to Liu Guxia that Lizhai suspected his illness was doubtful. </p>
<p>Come the spring of the Yi-Si year, Guxia told me, &quot;Mr. Jiang&#39;s condition has already reached the critical point.&quot; We went to see him together, and indeed, his throat was swollen and ulcerated, with a more pronounced pulse. Some tried using hot herbs, which hastened his passing.</p>
<p>In another case, Wu Shangshe, over fifty years old, suffered from swollen and painful throat. Sometimes blood would be drawn with acupuncture. Though his mind was clear, his chi pulse was flooding and rapid, yet there was no regularity, and upon pressing it was weak as though nonexistent. I remarked, &quot;Though there is form, there is no pain; this is a manifestation of yang. You must supply the yin robustly. If you instead damage the yin blood, you will certainly die.&quot; Eventually, he did pass away. This condition was caused by kidney qi deficiency, with rootless fire flaring upwards. Only through the modified Bawei Pill could one hope to return the fire to its source and perhaps save him.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>Within the cloud bridge of the government academy, there was a case of postnatal throat pain, and taking heat-clearing medications only worsened the condition. Upon examination, I determined it was due to a deficiency in the urinary bladder meridian. The pulse of the bladder ascends, reaching the neck and returning. I administered Ba Zhen Decoction, along with peony root, Chai Hu, and toasted black and yellow berberine, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In another case, Shen Da Fang had occasional phlegm in the throat, which prompted him to look left and spit it out, resulting in neck pain so intense that he could not turn his head. By night, the symptoms worsened, including night sweats and cold, numb hands and feet. He required assistance to get up or lie down, and any movement caused pain radiating to the heart and abdomen, creating countless degrees of suffering for three to four days. When I examined him, I said: this is the result of anger provoking liver fire, causing the gallbladder to generate heat and the tendons to contract. I prescribed Liu Wei Di Huang Wan with added gardenia and Chai Hu to clear the liver fire and nourish gallbladder blood. Within a day, his laughter and movements returned to normal, and when he met with guests, they did not recognize him as the same person who had been ill just days before.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from throat pain that ulcerated after two months, followed by generalized pain in her muscles and bones. I suspected it was a case of Yangmei sore poison, so I first treated her with several doses of Bi Xie Decoction, which alleviated her condition. I then prescribed over twenty doses of Si Wu Decoction combined with Bi Xie and astragalus, leading to the resolution of all her symptoms.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>A child suffering from a mouth ailment for over a year, which spread to the whole body, was treated with powdered rhizoma of dioscorea mixed with milk.

<p>A man initially suffered from a sore throat, followed by the appearance of various sores that were treated with light powders, but the condition recurred. After taking the previous medications again, the sores worsened, leading to severe ulceration of the hard palate, connecting with the nasal cavity. He had several lumps the size of peaches on his arms and wrists, which did not heal for over a year, showing evident signs of deficiency. I prescribed a treatment primarily with powdered rhizoma of dioscorea, along with remedies to strengthen the spleen, and he was stable after a month.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Qidong Yeyu&quot;: the illness of throat closure is rapid and severe. It has been passed down by predecessors to use only one ingredient, alum, but sometimes it does not always prove effective. In the year of Xinchou, while I was attending to my parent and returning from Fujian, I encountered many cases of this ailment on the way, with one family of more than ten people succumbing in a single night. The roads were silent, and travelers were fearful. Upon reaching Nanpu, an old doctor advised using duckbill胆矾 (alum) finely ground and mixed with strong vinegar for administration, which gave us courage on the way back, though we still did not know its ultimate efficacy.</p>
<p>One day, while my first son was supervising by the riverside, an old soldier who had been careful came to me in tears, asking for help, saying his elderly wife had suffered from severe throat closure for three days and was on the brink of death. I happened to have a small amount of medicine in my medicine chest, so I gave it to him and instructed him to use it as directed. The next day, he joyfully bowed in the courtyard, saying: &quot;As soon as she swallowed the medicine, she vomited profusely, releasing several pounds of phlegm, and she was cured.&quot; After that, whenever I treated several others, all showed immediate evidence of recovery. However, genuine alum is hard to find; those dedicated to health should not neglect to stock it for future use.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>Court physician Zhang Ruhuan suffered from a severe sore throat as the day progressed, arising from a deficiency of qi and blood combined with heat.

He was prescribed a strengthening formula, supplemented with wheat husk, five-flavor herb, and Six Flavor Pill for regular use, after which he no longer experienced these issues.</p>
<p>Autumn official Ye Ren&#39;an, whose constitution was primarily Yin deficient, suffered sudden throat swelling and alternating cold and heat due to anger, along with headaches, neck stiffness, and involuntary urination—the signs of liver fire. The liver governs sinews and the fiery condition caused swelling; excessive fire leads to blood depletion and muscle spasms, and overactivity of the liver resulted in urgent eye strain and neck tension, as well as weakness in the bladder causing involuntary urination. Thus, he was treated by needling the affected area to release toxic blood, and given prescriptions including Four Substances, Bupleurum, Gardenia, Scrophularia, and Licorice, leading to recovery. Additionally, he was given the Six Flavor Pill to nourish liver blood and replenish kidney water, resolving all symptoms.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>The magistrate Ye Tianpei had a swollen and painful throat, with phlegm not being expelled, hot hands and feet, and a preference for cold food and drinks.

After a week, he coughed out foul pus and recovered.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar, after attending three lectures, suddenly had a swollen throat that obstructed his ability to speak, losing consciousness, with difficulty breathing and an influx of phlegm, sweating profusely, and experiencing weakness in his limbs. His pulse was floating, large, and rapid. This was due to overexertion and a rootless virtual fire flaring up. He was treated with a dose of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added cinnamon, which immediately revived him.</p>
<p>The righteous man Gu Keming experienced throat pain, which developed into a fever at night. This was due to excessive liver fire with a deficiency in yin. He was treated with Si Wu Decoction combined with fried black Coptis,zhi mu, wheat ears, and five flavors, leading to his recovery. Later, due to overexertion, his throat swelled and closed up again. Acupuncture in the affected area caused bleeding; he was treated with Jie Geng Decoction to expel phlegm, leading to improvement. During mid-summer, he had a dry cough, hoarseness, thirst, and fever, with hot feet in the afternoon. Using Zi Shen Wan and Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan, he intermittently took them for over three months, and was pleased to find his health restored.</p>
<p>A woman had a swollen and painful throat, accompanied by constipation. She was treated with one dose of Feng Yin Tong Sheng Powder, and all her symptoms receded. Following that, she took three doses of Jing Feng Bai Du Powder and was stable. For this condition, if it is mild, treat with Jing Feng Bai Du Powder or Chui Hou Powder; if more severe, the best effect comes from using a Golden Key along with bleeding at the affected area. Otherwise, it may not help. Acupuncture at the Shaoshang points is also effective, but it is not as rapid as directly treating the affected area.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>A man suffered from sore throat and swelling, with a rapid and full pulse. After administering a dose of Liangge San, the pain stopped. When combined with Jingfang Baidu San and added to Baipenzi in two doses, the swelling and pain subsided. Then, with another two doses of Jingfang Baidu San, and four doses of licorice, balloon flower, schizonepeta, saposhnikovia, and yuanshen, he regained stability.</p>
<p>A man had a swollen and obstructed throat, with excessive phlegm. After applying alum in the throat, he coughed up a bowl of phlegm. He then took Qingyan Lige Tang in four doses and felt at ease.</p>
<p>A man experienced pain in his throat, unable to swallow medication. After acupuncture at the affected area released a small amount of purple blood, he melted Po Guandan in his mouth, followed by taking Qingyan Xiaodu San, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A man suffered from dryness and pain in the throat. Administering a modified Siwu Decoction with Huanglian, Zhimu, and Yuanshen in four doses led to slight improvement. After taking Renshen Gudan Wan in one dose, he did not relapse.</p>
<p>A man had throat pain that worsened in the afternoon, with a rapid but weak pulse. A modified Siwu Decoction with Huanglian, Zhimu, Jing, and Fang was given in four doses, leading to recovery. The previous formula was adjusted to remove Jing and Fang, adding Yuanshen, licorice, and balloon flower; after several doses, he did not experience any further issues.</p>
<p>A court official from Putian suffered from throat closure, treated with Fangfeng Tongsheng San, but he could not swallow due to swelling. I suggested acupuncture was necessary, but his jaws were clenched. Therefore, I pierced the Shaoshang point, which drew blood, and his mouth opened immediately. I then applied alum to the affected area, resulting in the expulsion of about two bowls of phlegm, and he then recovered with the previous medication. I have often seen patients with this affliction, who fear needles and avoid acupuncture, often lead to death.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>An old man experienced a sore throat, which was particularly severe in the afternoon. He was cured by taking a decoction of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with a few pieces of pan-fried Huang Bo and Zhi Mu. </p>
<p>A man had painful swollen breasts, with a floating and rapid pulse, but no pus had formed yet. After needling to release bad blood, he took two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du San and the swelling resolved. </p>
<p>Another man also had painful swollen breasts and was unable to eat. The ulcer was white, and pus had formed. After needling, the pus came out, and he felt better. </p>
<p>A man experienced swelling and pain in the throat, with a pulse that was initially floating and rapid, then became deeper and more solid. After taking one dose of Fang Feng Tong Sheng San, he had a bowel movement, and the condition quickly improved. Following this, he took two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du San and the swelling disappeared. </p>
<p>One patient was almost breathless, but his heart was still warm. He urgently needled the affected area, and black blood was released, leading to his revival. Both Bao Fu Qing and Qiao Shi Yu had experienced this condition, and they were cured by needling to draw out the blood. Generally, throat conditions are caused by fire, which can be very harmful and act swiftly. It’s crucial to determine the urgency and whether pus has formed. </p>
<p>If there is swelling and blockage, death could occur in an instant; it&#39;s advisable to use a golden key to clear the affected area, expel phlegm and saliva, allowing air to flow freely. If, after expelling, it is still closed, then it is due to bad blood or toxic pus, and urgent needling is necessary; otherwise, it may not be treatable. </p>
<p>The ancients said: treating the fire causing throat blockage is akin to extinguishing a fire; there is no time to delay. Additionally, it’s said: “Ride a horse and inspect the throat closure.” Indeed! There are many methods for treating the throat, but only needling has the power to restore life. Even without needling, simply using the juice of Wan Nian Qing in the throat and expelling it can lead to recovery.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>A man experienced pain in his throat, with phlegm causing a blockage. I intended to treat him with Jingfang Baidu San, adding Lianqiao, Shanzhizi, Yuanshen, and Niubangzi. However, he had taken cool,甘寒 (sweet and cool) medicines to降火 (reduce fire), which instead intensified his fever and the swelling in his throat worsened. In an urgent move, I needled the Shaoshang points and continued with the previous medicine, adding Ma Huang to induce sweating, and all symptoms gradually subsided. Only a purple area in the throat remained painful, indicating it might lead to pus; thus, I removed Ma Huang from the previous medicine for one dosage, and once the pus discharged, he recovered. </p>
<p>For throat pain, if treated early or in mild cases, it is advisable to use Jingfang Baidu San to disperse it. If treatment is delayed or in severe cases, needling Shaoshang points is necessary. If blood stasis has formed, it must be needled at the affected area, and needling Shaoshang is also applicable. If the throat is still uncomfortable but not entirely resolved, it will surely lead to pus; however, once the pus is eliminated, recovery follows. If there is constipation, even after needling to release blood, one must use Fangfeng Tongsheng San to promote movement. Sweet and cool medicines should not be used unless there is true heat.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>In the case of a county magistrate suffering from a swollen and painful throat, with chills and fever, and a rapid pulse, it was determined that the illness stemmed from the interplay of the lesser yin heart fire and the lesser yang fire channels. This condition was particularly severe, and the best treatment was to bleed the affected area. However, he was fearful of needles, so I first treated him with a cooling decoction. The medicine emerged from his nose; in haste to perform acupuncture, his jaw had already stiffened, making it impossible to needle. Thus, I needled the two points at the lesser commerce, manually pressed out the black blood, and his mouth opened immediately. I then needled between his throat and treated it with the previous medicine and a gold key to blow the area, leading to instant relief. Additionally, I prescribed a decoction of ginseng and a detoxifying powder with the addition of scutellaria, coptis, and arnebia seeds. After four dosages, he stabilized. The classical text states: &quot;When fire is trapped, induce sweating or bleeding; it is one aspect of inducing sweat.&quot; The Hejian record states: &quot;The fire causing throat closure must be treated with the same urgency as rescuing a fire, with no negligence allowed.&quot; It is common to encounter cases where throat closure does not yield to bleeding, or throat wind persists without clearing phlegm, resulting in many being beyond help. For each case of throat swelling and pain, or ulceration and toxicity, I have successfully used a decoction of schizopeplus and detoxifying powder with the addition of scutellaria and coptis; for more severe cases, I prescribed a wind-dispersing detoxifying powder, which proved effective.</p>
<p>A Mr. Du experienced swelling and pain in the throat, with lesions on his tongue, and was initially treated with a cooling throat and detoxifying powder in two doses, followed by a ginseng and peony decoction, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A man in his thirties frequently suffered from ulcerations in his mouth and tongue, appearing as if lacking skin, or having throat-related conditions. After taking a cooling throat and stomach-purging powder, his symptoms worsened, so I treated him with a regulating middle decoction, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>Wang Wenyuan had a swollen throat and mouth sores, worsening with fatigue. He was treated with a modified Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, adding Yuan Shen, wine-fried Zhi Mu, and Huang Lian, and he recovered.</p>
<p>A man experienced throat pain with a rapid pulse. He was treated with Jing Fang Bai Du San, adding Qiang Huo and Lian Qiao for two doses, which improved slightly. After removing Qiang Huo and Lian Qiao, he received another two doses and recovered.</p>
<p>A man had a swollen and closed throat, with a tightly clenched jaw, preventing needles from penetrating. First, he was needled at the Shaoshang points, resulting in black blood discharge. His mouth immediately opened, allowing further needling at the affected area, and after taking a dose of Qing Yan Li Ge San, he recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: One day, Lord Wenlu had a swollen throat, and the Hanlin throat expert treated him. After three days, the condition worsened, and the Emperor appointed Sun to treat him. Sun said: &quot;If I had a pen tube from Your Excellency, I could use it to apply medicine directly to the throat, and your condition would improve.&quot; Sun hurried to prick the throat; the Lord fainted, causing panic among those present. Sun then laughed, saying, &quot;It is not that I cannot save him.&quot; In a moment, he vomited out purulent blood and, after ten days, returned to normal. The Emperor was pleased and praised Sun as an excellent doctor with remarkable skills. </p>
<p>I once treated a man with throat blockage by needling the Tai Xi point, causing half a cup of black blood to discharge, leading to recovery. Thus, it is said that throat blockage results from stagnant toxic blood. In treating this condition, one must first disperse the stagnant blood; if dispersing is ineffective, then phlegm should be addressed; if phlegm does not improve the condition, then the toxic blood must be expelled.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>&quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Systems&quot; states: A man brought two servants into the capital, and one of them suddenly suffered from throat wind, swelling and blocking the airway, on the verge of death. He inquired of the local people and learned that there was a family of physicians named Li who specialized in throat ailments, so he ordered his servant to seek their help. Li Hai said: The condition is very dangerous; fortunately, you came here; otherwise, there would be no doubt of death. He then took a piece of paper from a box, rolled it, ignited it, and when the smoke rose, he quickly blew it out, instructing the servant to open his mouth and pierce the throat. Soon, the servant coughed out half a cup of purple blood, and at that moment, his breathing eased, allowing him to speak and eat porridge. After administering a powdery medicine, he was cured immediately. The man admired his remedy and secretly inquired about his secret; it was because he had previously coated the paper with dadura oil, so it ignited upon use, delivering its poisonous gas directly to the ailment.</p>
<p>Another person suffered from throat swelling and pain, unable to eat, with a fever and headache, and constipation. The opinions of the many doctors were conflicting; they all believed the heat required cooling medicine. A skilled physician said: The tight and rapid pulse is due to cold. The many doctors disagreed. The skilled physician said: I have a method to test for cold and heat. In the room, he lit a fire and used a decoction of scallions to steam the patient. If it were a heat illness, warm conditions would surely cause sweating, but if it were a cold, there would be no sweat, even with the bath. The patient trusted his words and bathed without sweating. In the bathing room, he took a dose of ephedra decoction; after a short while, he broke into a profuse sweat, his bowels moved, and he was well again. The other doctors admired his skill. Generally, discerning heat illness from cold using this method is most excellent.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Formulation Examination&quot; states: The &quot;Record of Famous Physicians&quot; mentions that when Princess Li Wang suffered from a throat abscess, her pain and swelling lasted for several days, and she could not eat or drink. When the medical officials were summoned, they all advised that she must use acupuncture and incision. The princess, upon hearing of needles and knives, cried and refused treatment. Due to the pain and inability to ingest water or food, a country doctor said: &quot;I won&#39;t use any knives or needles; I will only dip a fine point of a brush in medicine and apply it to the abscess, and it will burst forth immediately.&quot; The princess was pleased and ordered him to be called. After applying the medicine twice, pus and blood spilled out more than a cup, and she felt relief. After two days, the sore showed no issues, and she instructed that his method be provided. The doctor explained: &quot;I simply tied a needle to the brush tip and gently scraped until it burst; there is no other method.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;Orthodox Surgery&quot; states: A man had a swollen and painful throat, felt cold and fatigued, and his pulse was thin and strong. This indicated an exterior condition. A formula of Jingfang Baidu San was used, adding Burdock and Scrophularia, and the exterior symptoms retreated, but the swelling and pain remained. Another two doses of Scrophularia Detoxifying Decoction were administered, reducing the swelling and pain by half; after two more doses, he became stable.</p>
<p>Another man had a swollen and painful throat, with excessive phlegm. A gold key was used to first expel the thick phlegm, and Qingyan Lihge Decoction was employed to clear the accumulated heat. The swelling and pain slightly reduced, but it remained very red, indicating heat. Two doses of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction were given, with added Platycodon, and both the redness and swelling receded, leading to stability.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>A man who frequently drank strong liquor suddenly found his throat swollen and blocked, unable to speak with a stiff tongue and obstructed phlegm, putting him in a perilous condition. He first used a needle to prick the Shaoshang acupoint; his mouth was able to open. Then, he used tung oil and chicken feathers to expel thick phlegm, bringing up several bowls’ worth before his voice returned. He also used a needle on the swelling, which drew out purple blood, then rinsed with warm water and applied ice borax powder. He added Liangge San with Glauber’s salt and Tianhuafen to alleviate the accumulated heat, and finally prescribed two doses of Lianqiao San for stabilization.</p>
<p>A woman had a slightly swollen throat with a pale complexion, struggling to swallow. Upon examining her pulse, it was also faint and weak, indicating a deficiency in middle Qi and false heat. She was given two doses of Lizhong Decoction, which immediately relieved her pain; then, she took Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with pan fried Huangbo and Zhi Mu several times, and she did not experience a recurrence.</p>
<p>Another woman was very stout, suffering from a swollen and painful throat due to summer heat, with upper phlegm obstruction preventing her from speaking, putting her in a serious state. First, she used a needle to draw out toxic blood; then, with a golden key, she expelled thick phlegm in five or six bowls, after which a dose of Qingyan Lige Decoction slightly reduced the swelling and pain. After removing the salt and sulfide, she took more medication and stabilized.</p>
<p>A man was very fatigued, with a swollen and painful throat. He tried taking a throat-soothing decoction without effect. Upon examination, his pulse was thin and weak, indicating a deficiency due to overwork and false heat. In the morning, he took Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Mai Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Jie Geng, and Yuan Shen, and in the evening, he took Si Wu Decoction with Huangbo, Zhi Mu (fried black), and Gan Jiang, adding child&#39;s urine with the doses. Within a few days, the swelling and pain disappeared, and his fatigue alleviated, restoring his throat.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>A man suffered from increasing swelling and pain. He took throat-clearing and digestive medicines, but they did not help. He was determined to produce pus. To counteract this, I administered the Feng Tong Sheng San, reducing the use of both nitrate and yellow medicine. His throat was swollen and painful, but after acupuncture, he was cured.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue,&quot; it says: A friend of mine, Wang Pengque, was in his thirties and initially unrecognizable. He had a throat affliction for more than ten days. Upon my examination, I saw that his face and head were swollen, his throat and neck were extremely thick, he breathed heavily and his voice was hoarse, with swelling and mouth sores, causing him intense pain. A servant had been unable to lie down for several days. Upon checking his pulse, it was very thin and weak; when he spoke, his voice was faint. Inquiring about the medicines he had taken, they were all related to herbs like Scutellaria, Coptis, Gardenia, and Rhubarb. This was likely due to damage to the Yin, compounded by the invasion of cold, leading to excess cold at the lower part and blocking Yang at the top. Consequently, water and drink could hardly enter, and he was particularly fearful of heat. I said: &quot;This is serious! If we delay half a day more, it will be too late for treatment.&quot; So I prepared a cooling Yin decoction with cold water and let him drink it slowly. After consuming one decoction, he had a swollen and painful head and neck, but all symptoms disappeared by morning.</p>
<p>The next day, when I saw him again, he had lost weight and looked emaciated, unlike his previous bloated self. I then continued treatment with several doses of the Five Blessings drink and he gradually recovered. Those who doubted were initially shocked, but later, they were grateful to me for bringing him back from the brink, resulting in a deep bond of friendship.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>A woman in her thirties came to my home, suffering from exhaustion and pain in her throat due to a sore. She had seen many doctors without success. Upon examining her pulse, I found it rapid and weak; her symptoms indicated frequent loose stools. While asking about the treatments she had tried, she mentioned that they all involved clearing heat and removing fire. However, the more they cleared the fire, the worse her throat pain became. Upon careful observation, I realized that her issue was not due to excess heat and that she had been using too many cold and cooling remedies, which led to an empty feeling in her abdomen. Thus, I decided to specifically use nourishing herbal formulas like the Yin Replenishing Decoction and the Great Tonifying Yuan Decoction. In less than half a month, her throat pain reduced, and in less than six months, she was completely cured.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　火证喉痹，悉宜以抽薪饮主之；火不甚者，宜徙薪饮主之。凡肝胆之火盛者，宜以芍药、栀子、草龙胆为主；阳明胃火盛者，宜以生石膏为主。若大便秘结不通，则宜加大黄、芒硝之属，通其便而火自降。如火浮于上，而热结于头面咽喉者，最宜清降，切不可用散风升阳等剂，盖此火由中得升愈炽。经曰：高者抑之，正此之谓，非火郁宜发及升阳散火之义，学者于此，最当体察，勿得误认其面目也。至于外治火证肿痛之法，宜以木鳖子磨酢，用鹅翎蘸搅喉中，引去其痰；或少和清水，免其太酸，时时呷漱喉中，不可咽下，引吐其痰为更善。漱后以代匙散吹之，仍内服煎药，自无不愈。若火壅于上，而食物之治，最宜雪梨浆、菉豆饮之属为妙。若南方少梨之处，或以好萝卜杵汁，和以清泉，少加元明粉搅匀，徐徐饮之，既可消痰，亦可清火。其单双乳蛾，若毒未甚，脓未成者，治之自可消散，若势甚而危者，必须砭出其血，庶可速退。<a id="orig-78p" href="#trans-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>此因其急，亦不得已而用之也。又古法，用三棱针刺少商穴出血，云治喉痹立愈。　　阴虚喉痹，其证亦内热口渴喉干，或唇红颊赤，痰涎壅盛，然必尺脉无神，或六脉虽数而浮软无力，但察其过于酒色，或素禀阴气不足，多倦少力者，是皆肾阴亏损，水不制火而然。火甚者，宜滋阴八味煎、加减一阴煎之类主之。如火微而不喜冷物，及大便不坚，小便不热者，宜六味地黄汤、　一阴煎之类主之。若因思虑焦劳，兼动心火者，宜二阴煎主之。　　格阳喉痹，由火不归原，则无根之火客于咽喉而然，其证则上热下寒，全非火证。凡察此者，但诊其六脉微弱，全无滑大之意，且下体绝无火证，腹不喜冷，即其候也。盖此证必得于色欲伤精，或泄泻伤肾，或本无实火而过服寒凉以伤阳气者，皆有此证，速宜用镇阴煎为上，八味地黄汤次之；或用蜜附子含咽，亦妙。若再用寒凉，必致不救。　　阳虚喉痹，非喉痹因于阳虚，乃阳虚因而喉痹也。<a id="orig-79p" href="#trans-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>盖有因喉痹而过于攻击，致伤胃气者；有艰于食饮，仓廪空虚，亦伤胃气者；又有气体素弱，不耐劳倦而伤胃气者。凡中气内虚，疼痛外逼，多致元阳飞越，脉浮而散，或弱而濇，以致声如鼾睡，痰如拽锯者，此肺胃随绝之候，速宜挽回元气，以人参一味浓煎，放心徐徐饮之；如痰多者，或加竹沥、姜汁亦可。如迟，多致不救；如作实火治之，则祸如反掌。　　喉癣证，凡阴虚劳损之人，多有此病，其证则满喉生疮红肿，久不能愈。此实水亏虚火证也，宜用前阴虚喉痹之法治之。若多咳嗽肺热，宜以四阴煎之类主之。若满喉生疮，破烂而痛者，宜用牛黄益金散吹敷之，仍内服滋补真阴之剂，自可全愈。　　瘟毒喉痹，乃天行瘟疫之气，其证则咽痛项肿，甚有颈面头项俱肿者，北方尤多。此病俗人呼为虾蟆瘟，又名鸬鹚瘟，亦名大头瘟。此湿热壅盛最凶之候，宜清诸经之火，或泻阳明之热，当察缓急而治之。东垣有普济消毒饮，专治瘟毒喉痹，百发百中。<a id="orig-80p" href="#trans-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>　　锁喉风证，时人以咽喉肿痛，饮食难入，或痰气壅塞不通者，皆称为锁喉风，而不知有真正锁喉风者，甚奇甚急，而人所未知也。余在燕都，尝见一女子，年已及笄，忽一日于仲秋时，无病而喉窍紧濇，息难出入，不半日而紧濇愈甚。及延余治，诊其脉，无火也；问其喉，则无肿无痛也；观其貌，则面青瞠目不能语也；听其声，则喉窍之细如针，探息之窘如线，伸颈挣命，求救不堪之状，甚可怜也。余见而疑之，不得解。<a id="orig-81p" href="#trans-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>然意谓风邪闭塞喉窍，非用辛温不能解散，遂以二陈汤加生姜，煎而与之，毫忽无效。意复用独参汤以救其肺，然见其势危若此，恐滋怨谤，终亦未敢下手。他医见之，亦但束手而已。如此者，一日夜而殁。后又一人亦如此而殁。若此二人者，余至今莫识其所以病，此终身之疑窦，殊自愧也。然意必肺气竭绝而然，倘再有值此者，恐非独参汤决不能救。故笔诸此，以俟后之君子虚心详酌焉。　　杨梅结毒，有喉间溃烂作痛，久而不愈者，此非喉痹之属，乃杨梅疮毒也。宜仙遗粮汤；甚者宜以土茯苓煎汤，吞五宝丹。<br>　　　　石室秘箓 【清　陈士铎】<a id="orig-82p" href="#trans-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p>
<p>　　　　　肿痛</p>
<p>　　人有喉患大肿，又非瘿瘤，忽痛忽不痛，外现五色之纹，中按之，半空半实，此乃痰病结成，似瘤非瘤，似瘿非瘿也。方用海藻、半夏、白芥子、贝母、人参、桔梗、南星各三钱，茯苓五钱，昆布、甘草各一钱，附子一分，水煎服。此方乃消上焦之痰圣药也。又有海藻、昆布，以去其瘿瘤之外象，消其五色之奇纹。妙在消痰而仍不损气，则胃气健而痰易化也。一剂知，二剂消大半，三剂则全消，四剂永不再发。此方兼可治瘿证，神效。　　凡人有咽喉忽肿作痛，生双蛾者，饮食不能下，五日不食即死矣。但此证实火易治，而虚火难医。实火方，如用山豆根、芩、连、半夏、柴胡、甘草、桔梗、天花粉治之，立消。惟虚火乃肾火不藏于命门，浮游于咽喉之间。其证亦如实火，惟夜重于日，清晨反觉少轻；若实火，清晨反重，夜间反轻。实火，口燥热干而开裂；虚火，口不甚渴舌滑而不裂也。以此辨证，断不差错。<a id="orig-83p" href="#trans-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>此等虚痛，若亦以治实火之法治之，是人已下井，而又益之石也。故不特不可用寒凉，并不可用发散，盖虚火必须补也。然徒补肾水，虽水能制火，可以少差，而火热太盛，未易制伏。又宜于水中补火，则引火归原，而火势顿消亡于顷刻矣。方用引火汤，熟地、元参各一两，白芥子三钱，山茱萸、山药各四钱，北五味、肉桂各二钱，茯苓五钱，水煎服一剂，而痰声静，痛顿除，肿亦尽消；二剂全愈。盖熟地、山茱萸、五味之类，纯是补肾水圣药；茯苓、山药又益精而利水，助肉桂之下行；元参以消在上之浮火；白芥子以消壅塞之痰。上焦既宽而下焦又得肉桂之热，则龙雷之火，有不归根于命门者乎？一剂便生。真有鬼神莫测之机，又胜于八味地黄汤也。倘喉肿闭塞，勺水不能下，此方将安施乎？更有一法，用附子一个，破故纸五钱，各研末，调如糊，作膏，布摊如膏药，大如茶锺，贴脚心中央，以火烘之，一时辰，喉即宽而开一线路，可以服药矣。<a id="orig-84p" href="#trans-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>　　　　　乳蛾</p>

<p>For those with the Yangming pattern, there is internal heat and dryness of the throat, frequent urination, and irritability. In severe cases, the tongue may curl up or the testicles may retract and end its function.<br><em>Annotation: The hand jueyin (pericardium) and foot jueyin (liver) are involved. The excess of wood and fire qi leads to internal heat and dryness of the throat, resulting in liver qi descending. Irritability indicates the elevation of pericardium qi. The liver is associated with tendons; tendons are concentrated in the genitals and connect to the root of the tongue, leading to symptoms such as a curling tongue and retraction of the sac.</em></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>In cases of heart coughing, coughing results in heart pain, and the throat feels obstructed like a block; in severe instances, there may be swelling of the throat and pharyngeal obstruction.<br><em>Annotation: The throat is an orifice of the lungs. The heart fire consumes metal, hence the throat feels obstructed.

<p><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>When someone suffers from wind in the spring, it is considered liver wind. Symptoms of liver wind include excessive sweating, sensitivity to wind, frequent sadness, a pale complexion, throat dryness, and irritability, with an occasional dislike for women; diagnosis may reveal a bluish hue below the eyes.<br><em>Annotation: The pulse of the foot jueyin circulates behind the throat and ascends to the jaw. When the wind from wood combines as a pathogen, it leads to excessive heat and dryness of the throat. Liver qi disorders cause irritability. Anger outweighs contemplation, resulting in occasional disdain for women. The eyes are associated with the liver, hence the examination reveals signs below the eyes.</em><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discourse on Counterflow</h3>
<p>Counterflow of the hand-Yangming and hand-Shaoyang causes throat numbness, swelling of the throat, and difficulties in swallowing, which are ailments treated by the main physician. [Note: Hand-Yangming refers to the Lung&#39;s bowels, while hand-Shaoyang refers to the Sanjiao. Yangming governs the throat, the Lung governs the voice, and the fire energy of the Sanjiao is in counterflow, leading to throat numbness and swelling. Yangming is a channel of dryness and heat, while Sanjiao is associated with the heat of dragon and thunder; the combined heat in counterflow causes difficulties in swallowing.]</p>
<h3>Explanation of Pulses</h3>
<p>In the case of Jueyin, if there is severe throat dryness and internal heat, it is because Yin and Yang are deficient, leading to heat. [Note: &quot;Severe&quot; indicates excessive Yang energy. The energy of Jueyin is diminished by excessive Yang, thus also making Yin hot, resulting in severe dryness and internal heat.]</p>
<h3>Major Discourse on the Six Fundamental Principles</h3>
<p>Shao Yang governs the heavenly authority; the three energies lead to common illnesses of internal heat, such as deafness, blurred vision, blood overflow from sores, coughing and vomiting, nasal bleeding, thirst, yawning, throat numbness, red eyes, and a susceptibility to sudden death. [Note: The ailments of the people suffering from internal heat are due to the influence of wind and fire energy. The intersection of the two fires and the arrival of wind heat cause the susceptibility to sudden death.] The golden-tinged symptoms lead to coughing up counterflow, fullness in the chest and ribs radiating to the lower abdomen, leading to sharp pain that cannot be countered or turned; dryness in the throat, a dusty face, and a ghastly complexion. [Note: Counterflow of coughing and dryness are ailments of the Lung.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>The kidney&#39;s lesser yin meridian, when ill, presents symptoms of a hot mouth, dry tongue, swollen throat with difficulty in breathing, and dryness and pain in the throat. The triple warmer&#39;s lesser yang meridian, when moved, results in throat swelling and muscle lock. The small intestine&#39;s greater yang meridian, when moved, causes throat pain.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> These are ailments corresponding to the parts along the meridians.</p>
<p><strong>Organ Section</strong></p>
<p>When the lung is enlarged, it results in excessive thirst and is prone to chest tightness and throat obstruction with reversed qi. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The lung is located in the chest, opening to the throat, and governs respiration; thus, when enlarged, it causes such ailments.</p>
<p><strong>Worry and Anger Without Words Section</strong></p>
<p>The throat is the passage for food and water. The larynx is the conduit for the upward and downward movement of qi. The epiglottis is the door to sound. The lips are like the fan of sound. The tongue is the instrument for sound. The uvula acts as a barrier for sound. The pharynx is where the control of qi is released. The horizontal bone governs the divine qi that directs the tongue&#39;s movement. If a person&#39;s nasal passages produce mucus and do not recover, the pharynx is obstructed, causing a loss of controlled qi. Hence, if the epiglottis is small and thin, it releases qi easily; its opening and closing are efficient, leading to a smooth outflow of qi. If the epiglottis is large and thick, its opening and closing are difficult, causing sluggish qi release and heavy speech. If a person suddenly loses their voice, it means cold qi has invaded the epiglottis, preventing it from producing sound; when sound cannot descend, complete closure and opening do not occur, therefore resulting in silence.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The upper passage of the stomach is the throat, which is responsible for the intake of food and drink; it lies behind the throat. The upper passage of the lungs is the throat, which governs the inhalation and exhalation of breath; it is located in front of the pharynx. The epiglottis is situated above the pharynx and is the junction of the throat; when a person eats or drinks, the epiglottis covers the throat, allowing the food to enter the pharynx. Thus, the throat&#39;s upper passage serves as the doorway for sound, from which vocal energy emanates. The mouth opens and closes to produce speech; hence it is called &quot;shàn&quot; (fan). The tongue must move to articulate speech, which is why it is referred to as &quot;jī&quot; (mechanism). The uvula is the soft palate between the throat, from which sounds emerge, thus referred to as &quot;guān&quot; (gate). The pharynx, known as &quot;pángcè,&quot; is the upper opening of the palate, through which breath, mucus, and saliva communicate; hence it is called the place where breath divides, as breath is expelled from the mouth and nose through it. The horizontal bone at the base of the tongue is where spirit and energy circulate; therefore, it is the primary control for articulating the tongue. The nasal cavity expels mucus and saliva without retention; if the pharynx does not open, the division of breath is lost. The opening and closing of the epiglottis govern the emission of sound and breath; consequently, if it is thin, sound is produced rapidly, but if it is thick, opening and closing becomes difficult, and breath escapes slowly, hence speech becomes heavy. The proper energy of the Lesser Yin rises, and only then does the sound manifest; if cold energy lingers in the epiglottis, it cannot produce sound; thus it cannot open. If the sound cannot descend, it means it cannot close. Therefore, if opening and closing do not occur, there will be no sound produced.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

<p>When all three levels are floating, there is wind in the lungs, with copious nasal discharge and thick saliva.

<p>The throat corresponds to the spleen and stomach. It weighs twelve taels, is one foot two inches long, and two inches wide. Its circumference is twelve times, corresponding to the twelve hours. It governs the pathways of water and grains, facilitating spirit and qi. If there is internal heat, the throat will swell and block qi. Yujin ointment alleviates this. If there is cold in the organs, the throat will feel obstructed as if there is something stuck, with a constant urge to choke and a feeling of itchiness and phlegm. If there is heat, it should be opened; if cold, it should be unblocked. If it is neither hot nor cold, it should be adjusted according to the organs.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　窦梦麟曰：咽喉为饮食精气之要路。肺与大肠表里之别，上通咽喉，下由大肠，出入之门户也。入谷则昌，绝谷则亡。生死须臾之间，变证不一。惟肺金主气而生津液，灌溉一身，流润百骸。生生不已，循环无端，顺则五脏华敷，百关通畅。若阳明燥金受火克而疾生，系乎太阳之标，故推而治之，可以解热除毒，祛风顺气，则金自然平。丹溪以米酢搅口中，以出痰涎，此收之之义也。愚以为太酸则燥。先用黄虀汁，加元明粉少许，灌喉中以吊其痰；次用酢水，仍前加元明粉灌之；后用蜜汤润之，渐渐探吐其痰，则咽喉间开利矣。复以冰片散滋之，无有不效。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>Dou Menglin said: The throat is the crucial pathway for the essence of food and drink. The lung and large intestine are interconnected; the lung opens above to the throat, while the large intestine allows for the passage below. When food enters, life flourishes; when it ceases, life ends. Between life and death, changes in symptoms are diverse. Only the lung, governed by metal, regulates qi and generates bodily fluids, nourishing the entire body and moistening every bone. The cycle of life continues indefinitely, and when it flows smoothly, the five organs thrive and all passages are clear. However, if the dryness of metal is afflicted by the fire&#39;s invasion, it manifests swiftly, indicating a solar disorder. Thus, we treat by resolving heat and eliminating toxins, expelling wind and harmonizing qi, thereby restoring balance to metal. Danxi advised using rice vinegar to stir in the mouth to expel phlegm, which signifies alleviation. I believe excessive sourness causes dryness. First, use a bit of yellow ginger juice, add a little powdered Yuanming, and irrigate the throat to draw out phlegm; secondly, use vinegar water, adding more Yuanming powder to irrigate; finally, use honeyed water to moisten it. Gradually, phlegm can be expelled, thus opening the throat effectively. Additionally, using borneol powder for nourishment yields universally effective results.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the wind obstructs the throat and the three initial medicines fail to expel phlegm, it is advisable to use raw tung oil to flush it, stirring with a goose feather, then use honeyed water to moisten it. Urgently take Niuhuang Qingxin Wan or Puo Tan Wan to descend the phlegm. Subsequently, take Erchen Decoction with adjustments; there is no case that does not heal. If the voice from the throat sounds like thunder, with anxiety from eating and swelling in the eyes, if the Tianzhu point is depressed, and the face is dark with lips scorched, the nose devoid of breath, eyes protruding, and sweating like beads, this indicates death. If it extends to the neck, the head and face become swollen, red like fire, and medicines cannot treat it, urgently use a magnetic needle to expel the bad blood. Use chicken egg white mixed with frankincense powder for immediate healing. Then use banana root juice to soothe the toxins. If the mouth and tongue are swollen and purplish-black, urgently prick to release blood. Blowing herbal powder afterward is highly effective, thus making this clear. </p>
<p>Breathing entails expelling yang and inhaling yin. During the intervals of breathing, the lungs govern it. Below the throat, if we speak of the six organs, it refers to the yin of the limbs; below the oropharynx, regarding the six bowels, it refers to the yang of the limbs. The organs are associated with yin as the internal, while the bowels are associated with yang as the external. Organs hide and store; they are where the spirits flow and circulate; bowels are repositories, governing the intake and distribution of food and essence. Below the throat, the six organs relate to the throat&#39;s response to the natural world; thus, they are connected to the lungs. Since lungs belong to metal and autumn represents heaven, and autumn&#39;s metal is thus, the path of natural phenomena allows for the unobstructed flow of breath.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The throat and the pharynx run parallel; they are actually two distinct parts, yet many people are confused about them. The throat serves as the air passage, while the pharynx is where food and water pass through, and the throat connects to the qi of the lungs below. It is said that the throat contains three orifices; this is incorrect. If the throat had three orifices, then food and qi would each pass through a separate orifice into the lungs, but since the lungs have no orifice below, how could they convey food and water to the lower energizers? The writings of the Yellow Emperor state: The lungs are the crown of the viscera, storing the true high qi within the lung meridian. Hence, clear yang emerges from the upper orifices, while turbid yin exits from the lower orifices. If people in the world do not know how to maintain themselves, the six qi of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and heat, along with the seven emotions of joy, anger, worry, thought, grief, fear, and shock, can lead to ailments as a result of mismanagement and overexertion, causing a hundred diseases to arise. Once diseases like sore throat, chronic cough, throat sores, and throat closure due to wind, toxins, or heat develop, one must seek their origin. When faced with these conditions—throat constriction, phlegm accumulation, or throat inflammation—appropriate measures should be taken, but one must not act indiscriminately; when there is a need to purge, one should do so appropriately, and should not treat rashly. Such conditions pertain to the very foundation of life and death; without recognizing their roots and branches, attacking them recklessly will lead to misfortune almost immediately. Danxi noted: The throat and pharynx are essential for the entire body, connecting with the stomach and serving as the exit of breath. If heat and toxins accumulate in the chest, they can generate wind phlegm, leading to stagnation and resulting in throat diseases.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Sores develop in the throat, sometimes resembling flesh, with red swelling causing obstruction and making it difficult to swallow, leading to severe cases where a heavy tongue emerges. The primary treatment first aims to eliminate wind and phlegm to clear the throat and diaphragm, then to resolve the heat and toxins, as delays may lead to irretrievable conditions. Additionally, heat and toxins may surge to the palate and cause sores, known as &quot;suspended boils.&quot; Along with internal cold, this can also cause difficulty in swallowing and expectoration, hence a resolving method should be employed. Some say that treatment depends on the intensity of fire; if mild, treat directly; if severe, take countermeasures, inspect for phlegm and blood, and treat accordingly. Blood can be drawn at the lesser merchant point of the thumb to circulate qi. For those conditions that reach the exterior, external application of medication is essential. I have previously dipped a goose feather in rice vinegar to extract phlegm from the throat, as the acidity can help consolidate phlegm and disperse stagnant blood. If there are moths that do not disperse, use a small knife to draw blood just off the moth and apply powdered lead carbonate to the throat to dispel heat evils; take herbs such as changshan, indigo, licorice, platycodon, scutellaria, gardenia, rhubarb, and alum, adjusting the formula according to the symptoms to clear heat from the upper burner. Externally, herbs such as raw rehmannia, dragon liver, and leek roots can be used. If there are sores in the throat, whether white or red and often with bleeding, this is largely due to phlegm heat. First expel it with tung oil, then use licorice decoction to resolve the qi of the tung oil.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The affliction known as &quot;choking wind&quot; is associated with phlegm heat; when both the inner and outer throat are swollen, this is the condition. If there is no swelling externally, the body will be warm and the face red, indicating an extreme presence of heat and toxins. When there is swelling externally, the body is also warm, which is the result of the evils of fire manifesting outwardly. Sometimes the jaw is not strong, and there is no external swelling, but the throat is red, which indicates sudden sensitivity, and heat is present in the heart. If the affliction shifts from the left side to the right side, this is due to the lingering toxins not having left the body.</p>
<p>The throat can present various conditions: there may be accumulated heat, wind heat, pathogenic heat, or residual toxins after an illness, causing changes resembling a double-breasted moth. For example, if the throat is swollen and red for several days, shining like a mirror, this indicates accumulated heat. If the throat is swollen, slightly white, and shaped like an arm, this is due to wind toxin throat obstruction; this occurs when heat toxins encounter wind and fight against each other. If there is swelling in the throat with a purplish hue, this represents pathogenic heat, suggesting that the person is suffering from sudden exposure to heat toxins which congest the throat. It is essential to use herbs such as Mutong, Yuanshen, Shengdi, Huangqin, Huanglian, and Shanzhizi to clear the heart fire.</p>
<p>If one experiences shifting changes in the tongue, this indicates that heat has accumulated in the chest, hence the foul phlegm in the mouth. It is important to take cooling medications and apply treatments with borneol for support; one might also use a small (gold non-)knife to prick it to release purplish blood or toxins.</p>
<p>Why does throat obstruction cause swelling both internally and externally? This is due to the accumulation of wind and toxins in the throat, which results in congestion, stemming from a clash between wind toxins and phlegm. As stated in the &quot;Suwen&quot;: without wind, phlegm does not move; without phlegm, one is not affected by wind.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

If the voice is hoarse or silent after illness, this signifies punishment of the lung meridian, and the outlook is grim.</p>
<p>If there is wind-heat closure of the throat, both internally and externally swollen, it means the person has long accumulated heat toxins and then contracted wind, resulting in wind and heat colliding and blocking the throat.

If after more than ten days the illness remains unresolved with transmission leading to sore throat, and external symptoms like blue lips and curled tongue appear, this condition belongs to the uterine meridian and is difficult to treat. A dry sore throat with no phlegm is untreatable. Sore throat with a curled lip is untreatable. Sore throat with sweating in the head is untreatable. A black mouth indicates difficulty in treatment. Nasal congestion is untreatable. </p>
<p>If there is swelling in the throat and sores on the tongue, this indicates heat affecting the heart. Prolonged heat in the heart can lead to closure of the throat, and residual toxins drying the heart can result in tongue sores. One should use Bingpian powder and modify the Yuantan Shengma decoction for treatment. Its form resembles that of the bayberry, hence it is called &quot;heavy palate.&quot; If there is closure of the throat due to alcohol poisoning, and the alcohol has impacted both the heart and spleen channels, leading to throat obstruction, the individual will have a flushed face and upward-looking eyes. The phlegm-extraction method remains the same, followed by the use of Bingpian powder for blowing and cooling drinks.</p>
<p>If suddenly there is swelling and enlargement in the mouth, it is known as &quot;flying ulcer,&quot; which can be fatal. Use a small knife to puncture for bleeding, and add moss to detoxify, along with safflower and peony root. Difficulty with nausea and abdominal bloating is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Generally, the treatment method is the same for men and women. However, if a woman has swelling in the throat that is red in color, this signifies menstrual irregularity.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Double Nipple Moth</strong></p>
<p>The throat divides into two pathways, each receiving different ailments. The left throat is soft and concerns swallowing; the right throat is for speaking. The classic text states: the throat can distribute air, and the pharynx can swallow things. Therefore, diseases in the throat are collectively referred to as pharynx and throat. Physicians can treat them separately. The symptoms vary in types and appearances, and it is essential to examine them carefully.</p>
<p>The Double Nipple Moth, also known as the Double Moth Wind, consists of two growths on either side of the throat, the size of beans. Quickly administer a little yellow juiced, honey, mixed with Yuanming powder, gargle to dispel wind and phlegm. Then, take a decoction of Angelica and Forsythia, seven pills of realgar to clear toxins, and wash down with clear tea. Next, use Borneol powder and blow it in several times for immediate effect. Afterwards, take the Angelica and Forsythia decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Single Nipple Moth</strong></p>
<p>When the left side is affected by rising yang, swelling appearing slightly red signifies a blockage of lung qi, with external symptoms such as coldness in the hands and feet, spontaneous phlegm and saliva, dizziness, and blurry vision. Quickly administer a sour juice of sour vegetables mixed with Yuanming powder to clear phlegm; then blow in Borneol powder and follow with a decoction of Perilla Seed to reduce qi, Erchen Decoction, and Sweet Orange Decoction. If there is severe obstruction leading to loss of consciousness and breath, urgently ground Evodia into a paste and apply it to the soles of the feet.</p>
<p>For the right side, if the rising yang is slightly yellow, the shape resembles a silkworm cocoon, hence called the Nipple Moth. Symptoms also include coldness in the hands and feet, treated similarly. If there is accompanying back pain, add dried ginger and red peony root.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

If the swelling is yellow, the blood is black, its shape resembles an arm, and the swelling appears like a pit, with external signs of a flushed face and upward gazing eyes, this indicates that heat poison is damaging the heart and spleen. The energies of the two channels connect to the mouth, circulating up and down, hence the sore throat.

<p>The swelling appears like a yellow sugar plum, slightly yellow with red veins on top. There are external symptoms of pain in the neck and toothache, indicating heat in the stomach channel.

Blow in medicine, using powdered borneol mixed with Yuanming powder; for decoction, add angelica and astragalus, with double the amount of honeysuckle.</p>
<p><strong>Mute Phlegm Wind</strong></p>
<p>This mute phlegm condition occurs when phlegm from wind invades between the throat and diaphragm, causing the inability to speak and locked jaws. Urgently use toad venom, ground into water and dropped into the nostrils to open it up. Then, drop tung oil into the throat, and use goose feathers to stir the wind and phlegm in the throat until it is expelled, after which use licorice soup to dispel the tung oil&#39;s influence, applying powdered borneol.

<p>This poison arises from the spleen channels, due to the consumption of fried, oily foods, excessive drinking, and sexual activity, causing toxic gases to be unable to circulate and to accumulate at the root of the throat.

The treatment method is first to use vinegar water and juice to eliminate phlegm, then to apply throat-blowing medicine, blowing several times, followed by taking the Ba Zheng Shun Qi powder.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Knot</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises in the middle of the sternum, initially appearing like a plum pit situated between the throat and diaphragm, unable to be expelled or swallowed. After three days, it gradually rises to the throat, known as a throat knot. This disease requires puncturing; afterward, use bile nitre pill and blow it into the throat; then take seven pills of arsenic detoxification pill; still use the Si Qi Tang for five doses; finally, blow in ice powder.</p>
<p><strong>Qi Obstruction and Closure</strong></p>
<p>This condition is caused by accumulated poison blocking the throat, with thick phlegm and fever. It is still divided into three sections: upper, middle, and lower.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This condition results from heat and toxin affecting the heart channel, causing dryness in the throat without phlegm. If there is choking, treatment is not advisable. Use Chuanjisi Powder. If there is stabbing pain in the heart and lung area, continue with Danggui Lianqiao Powder and increase the dose of Dahuang for purgation. If left untreated for a long time, it can turn into a severe and deadly toxin that can harm life.</p>
<p><strong>Emotion-Induced Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This toxin arises from emotions such as joy, anger, worry, thought, sadness, fear, and shock, which injure the seven emotions, causing them to stagnate and form an abscess. The toxin then develops in the throat, and without prompt treatment, there is concern about the toxin attacking from within. If the throat bones protrude, pus will certainly emerge inside the mouth. Although it may not endanger life, it can lead to chronic conditions like a cold fistula. Use Shiqi Powder to treat it.</p>
<p><strong>Heel Wind</strong></p>
<p>This condition begins at the heel and extends to the throat, potentially recurring once a year or every six months. Avoid hot substances and do not be harmed by anger. The illness travels through one acupuncture point each day, and after seven days, seven points would be affected. Although it is not detrimental, it must be expressed. Use throat-soothing medicine and continue taking antidote powder. If there are foul-smelling bubbles, it can be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Closure</strong></p>
<p>This condition arises from external cold evil and internal heat harm, or from washing in hot water after a severe cold, forcing cold air into the lung channel, obstructing cold air in the middle jiao, and evil heat lodging in the heart channel, resulting in this illness. Urgently use a three-edged needle to prick the purple vein at the wrist or cause bleeding from the Shaoshang point; then use realgar detoxification pills crushed with cold tea for administration; also blow powdered Bingsh片 into the throat and wait for the expulsion of thick phlegm as a sign of recovery.

<p>The throat tumors appear on either side of the throat, either single or double, resembling large round eyes, wrapped in blood vessels; hence they are named. This condition arises when the lung meridian is overheated, often due to excessive talking that damages qi, explosive shouting when angry, hurried recitation, excessive drinking of strong alcoholic beverages, or overeating roasted and grilled foods. If provoked, it causes pain; if not, there is no pain. It is essential to calm the mind and breathe gently, using medication to combat it, which will lead to the disappearance of this condition. Do not attempt to break it open with a knife; it is advisable to take nourishing qi and wind-dispelling decoction, and apply musk powder.</p>
<p><strong>Suspended Abscess</strong></p>
<p>This toxin forms in the upper palate, resembling a purple plum, and descends to the tongue. The person cannot speak, cannot extend the tongue, cannot lower the head, and must stand upright with the face up; red nasal discharge may occur. If not treated promptly, the toxin may penetrate into the brain, leading to death. The treatment involves using a copper spoon to open the mouth, and a bamboo needle to puncture the head of the abscess, cleaning it with salt water until all blood has been expelled. Ice powder is then blown into the affected area, and the mouth is closed to allow the medicine to work and be swallowed naturally. This process should be repeated three to five times; one should also take a decoction of Schizonepeta and Forsythia, followed by three pills of toxic transformation powder, and drink cold tea to cleanse. Despite appearing externally, this condition originates in the upper palate inside the mouth.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>One Principle, Many Particulars</strong></p>
<p>The throat connects to the stomach, and the pharynx is an opening for lung qi. The throat swallows food, while the pharynx allows for the flow of qi. This unity is manifested in various distinctions.</p>
<p><strong>Suspended Sore</strong></p>
<p>A suspended sore in the throat is connected to vital areas; if the condition is not treated urgently, it can be fatal. The sore arises from the hard palate and is related to the throat. Therefore, if there is sudden swelling, it is also due to excessive heat.</p>
<p><strong>Plum-pit Qi</strong></p>
<p>When emotions are stagnant, phlegm and saliva accumulate, forming solid masses in the chest and abdomen that can block the throat like a plum pit. This prevents swallowing and leads to choking, harming the intake of food and drink. It is advisable to use the medicine &quot;Si Qi Decoction.&quot; Men and women with this condition should avoid anger and cold foods.</p>
<p><strong>Corpse Throat</strong></p>
<p>Corpse throat arises from imbalanced yin and yang, excess spleen and lung energy, and the invasion of wind, heat, and toxins, which cannot circulate normally. This causes parasites to activate, eroding the throat, causing itching or pain, akin to symptoms of hidden pests within. It should be differentiated from conditions like typhus and treated accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Grain Thief</strong></p>
<p>Grain thief refers to the sharp husks concealed within rice that, if mistakenly consumed, obstruct the throat and cannot be processed. Wind and heat combine with stagnant qi and blood, leading to swelling and pain. Urgent treatment is required, as it can also be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Pain</strong></p>
<p>Throat pain occurs when wind evil invades the throat, causing qi stagnation and heat, resulting in pain.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A sore throat is caused by excess heat in the stomach area, which disrupts the three burners, manifesting as white heads and red roots. It is advisable to disperse the condition with sound.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>The throat refers to the act of swallowing, while the larynx is related to the breath. The interaction between substances and air is contingent on the throat and larynx. When yin and yang are balanced, and the protective and nourishing energies are well-regulated, the pathways of qi flow freely. However, if one neglects nourishment, favors consuming minerals, indulges in overly roasted foods, or drinks excessively hot alcohol, it causes stagnation in the chest, leading to the accumulation of hot toxic energies that cannot be expelled, resulting in throat ailments. These ailments can present as swelling, pain, pharyngitis, or obstruction, leading to sores that cannot be swallowed or expelled, resembling flesh, all caused by wind, heat, and toxic energies. Additionally, there could be residual heat rising and burdening the soft palate, which may become enlarged. The soft palate pertains to the upper palate. There may also be cold in the internal organs, leading to an inability to swallow. Treatment should be approached with discernment.</p>
<p>The throat allows for the intake of substances, also known as the epiglottis. It is a critical passage for the flow of qi, connected to the stomach and governed by the earth&#39;s energies. The larynx is the space that allows for the passage of breath, connecting to the lungs and governed by heavenly energies. If the organ energies are balanced, illness does not arise; if they are imbalanced, with cold and heat leading to stagnation, disease develops. The key to treatment is to clear heat, warm cold, and harmonize the system when temperatures are neither hot nor cold according to the principles of classical texts.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Throat Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Throat obstruction: &quot;Obstruction&quot; means lack of sensation. It is often written as &quot;closure,&quot; akin to blockage. Fire governs swelling, hence heat affects the upper part and causes swelling of the throat.</p>
<p><strong>Ming Theory by Cheng Wujì</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pain, Itch, and Blockage</strong></p>
<p>When the throat is not functioning well, it may either be painful or itchy, and one may be unable to eat, all resulting from toxic energy rising. The classics state: if a person with a Taiyang condition has a tight pulse, they will surely have throat pain; this happens as Taiyang evil strikes the Shaoyin. The Shaoyin pulse runs along the throat and surrounds the base of the tongue. In cases of Shaoyin throat pain, the pulse is floating and slow; there may be chilling symptoms, or diarrhea, which are also related to Shaoyin. It is inappropriate to induce sweating or purging. Use a mixture of Platycodon decoction or Pigskin decoction; in severe cases, add Banxia powder, Tongmai Sini decoction without Peony, but add Platycodon. If sweating does not stop, apply a warm powder. For ulcers in the throat where one cannot speak, use a bitter wine decoction. If a person suffers from cold damage for six to seven days followed by significant purging, with a deep and slow pulse, absent pulse in the wrists, throat issues, blood and pus in the saliva, and persistent cold extremities, it is difficult to treat. One should use a Mahuang Shengma decoction. In cases of kidney cold damage, usually resulting from unexpected cold damaging the Shaoyin channels, with headache and back pain, the pulse is weak, initially throat pain due to cold damage, followed by diarrhea and throat pain. Banxia Guizhi decoction is recommended, which is the same as Banxia Sini decoction. For throat blockage, use Wufan decoction. For oral ulcers that are red and rotting, soak Huangbo in honey and dissolve it in the mouth. If throat pain is severe, use Shengma Liuwu decoction.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Confucian Duty to Parents</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Throat and Tongue Explanation</strong></p>
<p>The throat and tongue function differently, much like various remedies. The pharynx and throat, epiglottis and tongue, are all part of the same system, yet their roles are distinct. The throat allows for the passage of air, thus connecting to the heavens; the pharynx facilitates swallowing, hence connecting to the earth. The epiglottis and throat work together to manage openings; when food descends, the epiglottis closes to prevent aspiration, and during breathing, it opens to release air, allowing the tongue to touch the hard palate, thus enabling the epiglottis to seal off the pharynx. These four components interact and are essential; if one is absent, the processes of eating and drinking cease, leading to death. These four are indeed the gates through which air and food enter and exit, hence the critical nature of the “seven orifices” mentioned in the “Nan Jing,” with the epiglottis functioning as the door for inhalation. </p>
<p>When ailments arise, they can be summarized in one word: fire. The “Nei Jing” states: &quot;When yin and yang are in conflict, it is called throat obstruction.&quot; The commentary by Wang Taifu explains that &quot;one yin&quot; refers to the lesser yin of the hand, which is governed by the heart&#39;s fire; &quot;one yang&quot; refers to the lesser yang of the hand, related to the fire of the three heaters. Both fires govern the collaterals and channels in the throat; if heat accumulates, it leads to obstruction, and if obstruction worsens, it results in swelling, which can lead to blockage, ultimately resulting in death. The lesser yin of the foot follows the throat and envelops the root of the tongue, while the lesser yin of the hand encloses the pharynx; these two elements are indeed significant.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

In the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it speaks of one yin and one yang, referring to throat obstruction; why is this? It is because when people study the twelve meridians, many do not read the &quot;Lingshu&quot; text. The eleven chapters of the classic clearly record the principles of the twelve meridians, stating: The main pathway of the foot shaoyang circles the thigh and enters the hairline, connecting to the jueyin; the others enter the lateral costal region, follow through the chest, belong to the gallbladder, spreading above the liver, penetrating above the heart, and connect to the throat, emerging at the lower jaw.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The palm of the hand governs the heart, distinguishing it from the depths of the liquid three inches below, entering the chest, associated with the sanjiao, emerging through the throat and exiting behind the ears, merging beneath the bony region of the lesser yang. This is the qi of the hand&#39;s lesser yang sanjiao, combined with the qi of the heart&#39;s lesser yin, traveling through the throat. Examining the twelve meridians, only the foot taiyang diverges beneath the neck; the rest converge in the throat. Yet, why does the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; specifically mention the union of one yin and one yang resulting in throat obstruction? The essence lies in the governance of the two fires: when one prevails alone, it generates a heat-induced blockage, causing pain and rapidity. I argue that one can sum this up as fire. Therefore, in the twelve meridians, symptoms like throat dryness and pain, swelling of the pharynx, and strength at the base of the tongue, are all manifestations of the sovereign fire. Only the urgent throat obstruction arises from the fire of the minister. The sovereign fire resembles human fire; the minister fire resembles dragon fire. Human fire consumes wood slowly, while dragon fire does so rapidly. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; refers to throat obstruction, which situates the pharynx and tongue in between, as their ailments are both related to fire, hence they are not distinctly separated.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

When heat accumulates in the throat, swelling occurs externally, becoming both numb and itchy; if large, it is termed缠喉风. The condition of immediate death from throat obstruction is called走马喉痹. </p>
<p>Though these eight names are detailed, if they do not originate from heat, they are fundamentally different. Mild cases can be treated with softening methods, while severe cases require pungent dispersal; modern doctors have corresponding remedies such as mint, aconite, silkworms, white alum, and similar substances. As for走马喉痹, no such remedies are needed; it can swiftly lead to death. The most reliable method for treatment is bloodletting with a needle; once blood flows, the illness resolves. The Book of Changes states: &quot;When blood is expelled, healing occurs.&quot; </p>
<p>In the past, I treated a woman with木舌胀, her tongue filling her mouth, and various medicines proved ineffective. I used a small, sharp needle for bloodletting, resulting in significant reduction in swelling after five or seven attempts; it took three days to fully return to normal. The amount of blood expelled was nearly a斗 (a measure).<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In general, treating throat phlegm by drawing blood with needles is the most effective method. However, people fear needles, and seeking alternatives can lead to immediate death. If there are needle wounds from using needles, it is advisable to crush a piece of fresh ginger and mix it with hot white soup, sipping on it periodically to help the wound close easier. The &quot;Copper Man&quot; also mentions moxibustion, but it is only suitable for mild cases; for severe cases, delay may be deadly. Therefore, treating the fire of throat phlegm should be treated with urgency, akin to extinguishing a fire. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that when fire is stagnated, it must be released, referring to inducing sweat. However, how can one induce sweating in the throat? Thus, drawing blood is a form of inducing sweat. Future practitioners should not cling to narrow methods, claiming that their treatment does not affect the internal organs, which is superior to bloodletting. If they are fortunate enough to succeed with minor ailments, they may unfortunately encounter serious illnesses and face fatal consequences.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Throat Wind</strong></p>
<p>Throat wind is associated with phlegm heat. Dai Sigong states that when both the inside and outside of the throat are swollen, it is so. Throat wind, and the symptoms of throat closure, arise from the presence of phlegm and saliva in the diaphragm or from unregulated alcohol, lust, and emotions. When fire agitates the phlegm and obstructs the throat, it leads to swelling and pain both internally and externally, making it impossible for fluids to be ingested; this can be considered dangerous and urgent. The symptoms of throat wind appear first with a tight feeling in the chest and diaphragm, shortness of breath, and suddenly swelling and pain in the throat, along with coldness in the hands and feet, leading to obstructed breath if left untreated for even a moment.</p>
<p><strong>Breast Moth</strong></p>
<p>The single moth wind appears round, about the size of a small chopstick head, located above the throat, either on the left or right side, and is difficult to treat below the throat. The double moth wind consists of two similar round formations on either side of the throat, also about the size of a small chopstick head, which is likewise difficult to treat below.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Wind</strong></p>
<p>Throat wind is identified by red coloration from the area around the jaw to beneath the jaw. Generally, both the inside and outside being swollen indicates throat wind. In cases of throat closure, where toxic energy returns to the heart, leading to fullness in the chest, accelerated breath, and persistent diarrhea from below, it is fatal.</p>
<p><strong>Suspended Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Suspended abscess is referred to as &quot;Emperor&#39;s Bell.&quot; When the abscess is swollen and hangs down several inches, it is called &quot;Emperor&#39;s Bell Wind.&quot; It is advisable to use a salt and alum powder; it should not be pricked, as doing so can be fatal.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Treatise: An Overview</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The convergence of one Yin and one Yang is called throat obstruction. Wang&#39;s commentary explains that one Yin refers to the Jueyin liver and the pericardium, while one Yang refers to the Shaoyang gallbladder and the Sanjiao. All four channels contain the relative fire. Shuhe stated that the gallbladder and Sanjiao seek fire treatment, while the liver and pericardium are no different. Dongyuan remarked that fire and vital energy do not coexist; where one prevails, the other diminishes. When vital energy is deficient, relative fire can arise, causing sudden outbreaks of throat obstruction and similar ailments.</p>
<p>The epiglottis, referred to as the &#39;door of breath&#39; in the classics, is a crucial gateway for the elevation and descent of respiration in the human body. When there is sudden swelling and pain, with water and liquid unable to enter, and speech hindered, death can occur in an instant, which is truly alarming. Swelling on both sides of the epiglottis is colloquially known as &quot;double breast moth,&quot; which is easy to treat. Swelling on one side is called &quot;single breast moth&quot; and is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Ancient formulas referred to throat obstruction, which is caused by the rebellion of relative fire. The classics say: One water cannot overcome two fires; moreover, two waters cannot overcome five fires. This suggests the ease with which true water can be depleted and relative fire can become active. For instance, great anger can cause fire to rise from the liver, sexual indulgence can cause fire to rise from the kidneys, and irregular diet can incite fire from the spleen and stomach. Thus, fire is the root of phlegm, and phlegm is the manifestation of fire. Fire is characterized by its rapid nature, hence illnesses can erupt violently.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The method of treatment must first involve expelling the phlegm, or using a gold needle to puncture the swollen area; this is an urgent, symptomatic treatment. When using medicine, one must adhere to the treatment principles from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; employing herbs such as Platycodon, Licorice, Scrophularia, Cimicifuga, Saposhnikovia, Notopterygium, Schizonepeta, Ginseng, Atractylodes, and Poria, with a small addition of dried Ginger and Aconite, administered gradually and frequently, never taken in a single dose. This is the fundamental method of treatment. One must absolutely avoid taking cold and cooling medicines, as not only are they unhelpful, but they may also hasten death. The common people are often unaware of this principle and hastily resort to strong herbs like Scutellaria, Coptis, Gardenia, and Rhizoma Picrorhiza, believing they are treating the condition. Worse yet, they mix in very bitter and cold medicines, taking them frequently and in large doses, perceiving only a slight reduction in swelling or slightly improved speech, celebrating the effects with the physician, unaware that the underlying heat has not been resolved while cold has re-entered, allowing toxins to invade the abdomen, which may ultimately lead to persistent cough, becoming untreatable—how lamentable this is! </p>
<p>There is an external condition called &quot;big head disease,&quot; commonly known as &quot;pinched head plague,&quot; which is quite severe, with a mortality rate of eight or nine out of ten among those infected. Treatment should focus on regulating Qi, and the methods are not vastly different. A remarkable remedy is the &quot;Universal Detoxifying Drink&quot; by Dongyuan, proven to be effective, deserving of thorough study and expansion by practitioners, as it aims to save lives in this world, which is indeed fortunate!<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<p>For throat pain due to heat obstructing, or coughing with blood, use Jinfeicao powder, supplemented with cinnabar phlegm-dissolving pills. If throat pain does not improve with all cooling medicines, use Zhi Nan decoction. </p>
<p>For throat obstruction causing pain, swelling, and inability to speak, with foreign sensation in the throat (named &quot;throat wind&quot;), use sweet mandarin peel decoction. If heat obstructs the upper jiao, causing sore throat, and swallowing dry substances feels less moist than usual, with a dry mouth while sleeping, use Holy Decoction with half a part of ginseng and seven parts of original ginseng, or be supplemented with Bingyun powder and chicken-suet pills. </p>
<p>For concurrent upper obstruction and irritability in the heart, use the five spirit powder with cinnabar.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Treatise</strong> 【Ming Dynasty - Lou Ying】</p>
<p><strong>Regarding Pain and Sores from Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;throat obstruction&quot; refers to the inability to breathe properly through the throat, resulting in a blockage of speech and air. The term for &quot;throat pain&quot; and &quot;pharyngeal pain&quot; indicates the throat&#39;s incapacity to swallow saliva and food, associated with blockages of the earth&#39;s energy. &quot;Throat obstruction combined with pharyngeal pain&quot; denotes an illness affecting both the throat and pharynx, leading to blockage of both celestial and earthly energies. It is evident that one suffering from throat obstruction must also experience pharyngeal pain, while those with isolated pharyngeal pain cannot simultaneously suffer from throat obstruction.</p>
<p>Throat obstruction accompanied by aversion to cold, and a weak pulse at the wrist, are considered exterior symptoms. In such cases, it is appropriate to use sweet tangerine decoction or a mixture of pinellia, cinnamon twig, and licorice to address the aspects of cold, heat, and dispersion. If one is unable to consume liquids, use the detoxifying xionghuang pill (realgar pill), grinding four or five pills in highly sour vinegar, administering it into the mouth, and then expectorate the thick phlegm. Follow this by sucking on the natural juice of fresh ginger, which has a remarkable effect.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In cases of throat obstruction accompanied by chills, it is caused by cold defeating heat—cold confined externally and heat stagnating internally. Ginger juice disperses the external cold, allowing the internal heat to be released and thus lead to recovery. One must avoid using bile and copper sulfate, which are cold agents applied to the throat, as they can cause the yang to stagnate and not extend; also to avoid using cooling agents like nitre and yellow sulfur, as they would lead to the sinking of yang into the interior, resulting in disaster in no time. Han Zhihe states that when the pulse at the inch is weaker than that at the guan and chi, it is necessary to dissipate yin and assist yang. Dongyuan states that when the pulse at the two inches is insufficient, it indicates a deficiency of yang qi; thus, exterior medications are used to lift its energy to support yang. If all three positions have small and weak pulses, the same method can be applied.</p>
<p>Throat obstruction, which is common in rural areas, generally resembles one another, as they belong to the malady of the atmospheric influence of heaven. Therefore, treatment must first disperse the exterior, and it is highly forbidden to apply sour medicines or cold medicines, as they would cause the evil to remain internally and not be released. There are two types of illness: The first belongs to fire. The classic states: &quot;The lesser yang leads to throat obstruction.&quot; It also states that the lesser yang governs the affairs of heaven; when the summer heat arrives, the people suffer from throat obstruction. Treatment should follow Zhongjing’s syrup of platycodon. If there are red spots on the face, it indicates yang toxin, and one should utilize remedies for yang toxin to induce sweating. The second belongs to dampness.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

If the face is bluish-black, it pertains to Yin poison, and it is suitable to sweat out the Yin poison using various prescriptions. </p>
<p>In the spring of the fifth year of Hongwu, there were many cases of throat obstruction in the villages, which was due to the qi at the end of the previous year and the beginning of this year, the two fires causing evils.

Han Zhihe said: If the pulse at the inch is larger than that at the guan and chi, it is advisable to disperse yang and assist yin. Dongyuan states: If the two-inch pulse is solid, it indicates an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; if treated, it will improve. Therefore, I often employ this method to treat acute throat obstruction, as one would respond to a drum. If all three positions are solid, this method can also be applied.</p>
<p>In cases of acute throat obstruction, if the voice resembles snoring, as if there is phlegm resonating in the throat, this indicates a severe condition of the lungs. Immediate use of ginseng paste is necessary, consumed with ginger juice or bamboo juice. If ginseng paste is not available, first boil ginseng soup for relief. Taking it early leads to an almost full recovery; later, it results in a partial recovery and, if delayed, only minimal improvement.</p>
<p>For throat pain, there is a significant deficiency of yin and an excessive escaping of yang, with phlegm accumulating above, leading to the pain. The pulse must be floating and large, with a heavy touch yielding a roughness. Immediate treatment should restore balance between yin and yang, using only ginseng, boiled to a rich decoction and consumed slowly.</p>
<p>Throat ulcers tend to have excessive fire, roaming without restraint, troubling the throat. It is advisable to use ginseng, honey-fried yellow bitter herb, and schizonepeta to treat it.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Chen)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Throat Diseases Belong to Fire</strong></p>
<p>The respiration and the intake and output of food through the throat are the gateways of the human body. In later generations, there are eighteen named types of throat diseases, which, although diverse, all return to the element of fire. This is because the lesser yin provides the sovereign fire, and the lesser yang provides the ministerial fire; these two channels converge in the throat. If the sovereign fire is weak, it leads to heat accumulation, resulting in pain and swelling. If the ministerial fire is strong, it results in severe swelling and insensitivity, potentially leading to obstruction that may result in death. Hence, it is said: “The union of one yin and one yang leads to throat obstruction.” Both the liver and pericardium belong to yin, while the gallbladder and sanjiao belong to yang; all four channels have ministerial fire. Fire is the origin of phlegm, and phlegm is the manifestation of fire. Therefore, when mentioning fire, phlegm is inherently present; and when speaking of the throat, the teeth and tongue are also included.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fire Differentiates Between Reality and Illusion</strong></p>
<p>Real fire is caused by overeating fried and roasted foods, leading to the accumulation of heat and toxins, resulting in thirst, constipation, phlegm, and wind attacking upwards, which can cause throat obstruction. There must be three days of discomfort in the chest and diaphragm, with a tight and rapid pulse. The treatment should first eliminate wind and phlegm, followed by detoxifying heat, cooling the diaphragm with a formula adding Huang Lian (Coptis), Jing Jie (Schizonepeta), and Shi Gao (Gypsum). Alternatively, one can use Gu Jing Huang Decoction, Fang Feng Tong Sheng Powder, or San Huang Pills to dissolve in the mouth. If wind dries the throat making it parched and spiky, causing difficulty in swallowing, use Bai Du San with added Huang Qin (Scutellaria), Ban Xia (Pinellia), and increase the amount of Jie Geng (Platycodon), Bo He (Mint), and Sheng Jiang (Ginger) for decoction. If phlegm is excessive, add Shi Gao. For these medications, take them at midday or later. If there is vomiting or damage due to consuming hot foods and prickly grains, along with swelling and pain from wind-heat clashing with blood and qi, use Xiao Feng San adding Bo He, Yuan Shen, and Quanfeng, or She Gan Decoction or Niu Bang Zi Decoction. For a heavy tongue, it is like a sacred golden ingot. For swelling at the root of the tongue, use She Xiang Zhu Sha Wan.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those experiencing sore throat, use the Puji Xiaodu drink. Excess heat from drinking alcohol stirs the spleen&#39;s fire; anger stirs the liver&#39;s fire; lust stirs the kidney&#39;s fire. When the fire rises and attacks, the throat and esophagus become dry, but urination remains normal, with a faint pulse in the lesser yin. Treatment should focus on tonifying deficiency and lowering heat. For those with blood deficiency, use Siwu Decoction with additional Platycodon, Schizonepeta, Anemarrhena, and Coptis; for those with qi deficiency, use Si Junzi Decoction with added Licorice, Platycodon, Radical Scrophulariae, and Cimicifuga, possibly with dry ginger and Aconite as guiding herbs, taken gradually. If phlegm is excessive, add a fresh fish gallbladder to Erchen Decoction, prepared with glutinous rice and dried into powder, and taken with ginger juice; consider also the Tanhutu or Qianjin decoctions. For those who have previously taken cooling medicines and have sound issues, use the Secret Transmission Decoction to regulate qi. </p>
<p>For sudden cold-induced throat constriction, use Chaiqiao Banxia Decoction or Pigskin Decoction. For kidney-related cold and yin conditions, use Banjiao Decoction with honey and Aconite. </p>
<p>Common remedies include Ganjiao Decoction, Ligao Decoction, Bingmei Pill, and Rhinoceros Horn and Amber Ointment; alternatively, use a single herbal powder mixed with honey to form pills the size of peanuts, taking three pills with freshly drawn water. </p>
<p>Generally, cooling medicines should not be used alone for the throat. A rapid effect may mask residual heat, leading to renewed cold symptoms. When toxic qi invades the abdomen, it can cause swelling in the chest, shortness of breath, diarrhea, and cyanosis of the hands and feet. If after seven days one cannot eat and the mouth resembles that of a fish, it can lead to death.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Jiao Method:</strong> Use powdered bile from a blue fish three times, and the swelling will disperse.<br><strong>Tu Method:</strong> Use the bile of a blue fish in winter, mixed with dry alum; when in use, add some finely roasted herbal powder and a little salt, mixed with vinegar, and use a goose feather to dip in the medicine to induce vomiting until all phlegm is expelled. If fish bile is not available, use half a pound of white alum and ten pieces of croton seed meat, combined with dry alum, then remove the croton, and induce vomiting; this is remarkably effective. After vomiting, use a golden key to blow it; regularly drinking sweet orange soup is most excellent. If the jaw is tightly clenched, use a jaw-opening medicine afterward, or two immortal powder; for those who are unconscious, use a one-character powder.</p>
<p><strong>Expelling Fire through Sweating</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Expelling fire through sweating&quot; means to induce sweat. Throat ulcers should avoid sweating to prevent worsening the condition. Only when using a needle to draw blood is the essence of sweating applicable. If a lot of blood is drawn, healing occurs. For those with needle sores, ginger juice mixed with warm water should be sipped at intervals. If the patient fears needles, apply a gentle needle technique. In cases where there are severe blood blisters on the upper body and none visible on the lower body, have the patient hold a mouthful of water and use a sharpened bamboo tube to prick the nostril and draw blood, which is effective. However, for those who have kidney damage from cold or swollen with Emperor&#39;s bell, needles should be avoided. Burn snake bed seeds in a bottle, and have the patient inhale the smoke into the throat for healing.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Remarkable and Effective Formulas</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Fang Xian)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Dai Ren Yun: The throat and the larynx, the epiglottis and the tongue, these four exist within one system, yet their causes differ. The throat is for taking in air, thus the throat&#39;s air communicates with heaven; the larynx is for taking in food, thus the larynx&#39;s air communicates with the earth. The epiglottis and the larynx work in conjunction to control opening and closing; when food descends, it is sucked in and covered, and when air rises, it is exhaled. Hence, when the tongue presses against the hard palate, the epiglottis can close off the throat. These four interact in function; if one is missing, eating and drinking cease, leading to death. These four are the portals for the circulation of air and food, being in the most critical area, which is why they cause illness; signs of throat pain and laryngeal obstruction are difficult to treat. Mild cases may be cured through treatment, but severe cases often result in peril. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;A blockage of one yin and one yang is termed laryngeal obstruction.&quot; Wang&#39;s commentary states that one yin refers to the Hand Shaoyin’s Heart channel, while one yang refers to the Hand Shaoyang’s San Jiao channel. Both fires govern the channels and are interconnected in the larynx; when air is hot, it can lead to internal blockages, which, if severe, cause swelling; excessive swelling leads to obstruction, and if obstruction becomes extreme, it can result in death. It&#39;s not just these two channels causing this illness; according to the twelve channels, only the Foot Taiyang diverges below the neck, while the others converge at the throat. Hence, when the two fires (the Ruler and Officer) dominate, the heat causes blockages, leading to pain and rapid onset.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the twelve meridians, pain in the throat, swelling in the jaw, and swelling of the tongue are primarily caused by the Emperor Fire. However, a sudden closure of the throat is attributed to the Minister Fire. The Emperor Fire is akin to human fire; the Minister Fire is similar to dragon fire. Human fire burns wood slowly; dragon fire burns wood rapidly. The texts state that a throat obstruction involves both the throat and tongue, and since the affliction is due to fire, they are not differentiated. Later scholars should examine its details; here are eighteen symptoms of throat and pharynx disorders:</p>

<li>Cicada Tongue Wind (Chan She Feng), also known as &quot;Re-grown Tongue&quot; - a second tongue regenerating from below the original tongue.</li>
<li>Toothworm Wind (Ya Qi Feng) - swelling on the gums leading to pus-filled sores.</li>
<li>Wood Tongue Wind (Mu She Feng) - the tongue gradually enlarges, resembling a cooked pig tongue, unable to move.</li>
<li>Yellow Tongue Wind (She Huang Feng) - swelling and pain on the tongue with a yellow color.</li>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although the eighteen types of ailments are distinct in name, their treatment should not be far removed from the concept of fire. Minor ailments can be alleviated with softness, while more serious ones can be resolved with sharpness. For treating these conditions, the world has methods such as mint, aconite, silkworms, alum, nitrum, and verdigris. As for the throat affliction caused by running horse, what need is there for these remedies? The difference between life and death is as close as a person&#39;s palm. The least harmful method is bloodletting with a needle; once blood flows, the illness is resolved. Yet, people fear needles and seek other means. If one persists in this, they risk losing their life in an instant. When using needles, if one chokes, it is advisable to crush a piece of fresh ginger and mix it with hot white soup to sip occasionally, which will mitigate the choking. Treating throat afflictions is akin to firefighting; it cannot be taken lightly. According to various texts, for a swollen tongue, urgently use a small and sharp needle to draw blood five to seven times to alleviate the condition. For wind swelling in the throat that cannot be relieved by medicine, instill cool medicine through the nose to expel it, while also applying a detoxifying poultice outside; once heat diminishes, the swelling will subside. Throat afflictions are related to dragon fire; even when using cooling agents, one should frequently sip on an intensely hot decoction. This medicine acts with heat to guide out the cold, not as a rejection of heat illnesses. Additionally, frequently pricking the Lesser Shang point with a small needle to draw blood can lead to recovery. Future practitioners must distinguish between human fire and dragon fire ailments; effective treatments will follow.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

<p>The throat swallows substances, while the larynx awaits the wind; its essence is clear and void, allowing no trace of turbidity. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: the qi of the three jiao connects to the throat, hence vocal sounds arise. Nevertheless, the three jiao pertains to the fire of the yang, and fire leads to diseases appearing rapidly, thus a sudden swelling in the throat is called &quot;throat obstruction&quot; in ancient texts. There may also be phlegm-fire rising from the stomach, causing obstruction in the patient. Generally, if it arises abruptly, it must be phlegm-fire, and the urgent remedy is to induce vomiting, while needling to dispel toxic blood is superb. Those ignorant are fearful and hesitant, often leading to unfortunate outcomes, showcasing a lack of understanding of the correct principles.</p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Cases (Ming - Xue Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obstruction Pain Syndromes</strong></p>
<p>Master Danxi said: throat pain is due to blood deficiency, treated with Si Wu Decoction plus bamboo juice; for yin deficiency with rising fire, one must use Yuan Shen; for qi deficiency, add ginseng and bamboo juice. Furthermore, for swelling and pain in the throat, if there is yin deficiency and yang energy surging, with phlegm binding above, the pulse must be floating and large, while the heavy pulse should be thin. To expel the dead, one should use ginseng decocted strongly and drunk slow. If one treats it with methods for solid symptoms, the calamity is at hand. This is something previously unrecognized by others, saving countless lives from premature demise. Additionally, I mention the conditions related to upper jiao wind-heat and bladder yin deficiency briefly afterward. Pain or cold and heat indicate the pathogen is at the surface, thus it should be dispersed. For swelling, pain, and an abundance of phlegm and saliva, the pathogen is above.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is pain with a rapid and weak pulse, it indicates a deficiency of Yin; one should nourish Yin and clear heat. If there is swelling, pain, fever, and constipation, this indicates a condition of excess both inside and outside; one should resolve the exterior and attack the interior. If the symptoms are urgent, one may puncture the affected area or needle the Shaoshang point. </p>
<p>Mr. Xiaoshan says: In cases of throat obstruction without aversion to cold, with a pulse that is large and slippery at the cun and guan positions, these indicate a lower condition; it is advisable to use cold medicines such as Niter or Indigo to reduce it, or sour agents like copper sulfate to collect it. Mr. Han Zhihe states: If the cun pulse is larger than the guan and chi pulses, one should disperse Yang and assist Yin. Mr. Dongyuan notes: Both cun pulses being solid indicates excessive Yang and deficient Yin; by purging it, one can promote recovery. Therefore, I respect this method for treating the aforementioned conditions, akin to the response of a drum.</p>
<p>Chen Zangqi often treats interior cold and throat obstruction, causing difficulty in swallowing and expectoration, using prepared Aconite without skin and navel, coated with honey and roasted, so that the honey can enter; one should hold it in the mouth without swallowing. It is said to be very effective.</p>
<p><strong>Meiheqi</strong></p>
<p>Meiheqi refers to a sensation of blockage in the throat, where one cannot cough it out or swallow it down, resembling a plum pit. This is caused initially by excess joy and anger, which accumulates heat and leads to phlegm and fluid stagnation, resulting in this ailment. One should use a modified version of the Siqi Decoction and a modified version of the Erchen Decoction.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Phlegm-Heat in the Throat</strong></p>
<p>Heat accumulates in the throat, causing swelling around the outside, resulting in numbness and itchiness. Severe swelling is termed &quot;Wind Phlegm in the Throat.&quot; If the throat is closed and suddenly leads to death, it is called &quot;Running Horse Throat Phlegm.&quot; </p>
<p>Phlegm-Heat arises when heat rises and affects both sides of the throat, creating external swelling. It resembles the shape of a butterfly, with one side being singular and the other double. The smaller variety of this phlegm is called &quot;Throat Closure.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang)</p>
<p><strong>Throat Abscess</strong></p>
<p>If one asks about the occurrence of abscesses on both sides of the throat, the response is: This is called &quot;夹疽&quot; (Throat Abscess), which pertains to the Heart Channel of the Lesser Yin, the Spleen Channel of the Greater Yin, and the Liver Channel of the Jueyin, resulting from hot toxic energies rising. It is advisable to use amber and rhinoceros horn ointment, rhinoceros horn powder, Huanglian Disinfectant Decoction, and Huoming Decoction with added Yan Shen, Jie Geng, and Huang Lian. Those with internal suppuration are difficult to treat. If there is rising fire from deficiency and phlegm blockage with an inability to eat, death may ensue.</p>
<p><strong>Throat Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>If one asks about the occurrence of a carbuncle in the throat, the response is: It is termed &quot;Throat Carbuncle,&quot; also known as &quot;Severe Carbuncle.&quot; Due to its intense heat and toxicity, it is fearsome. It belongs to the Ren Channel as well as the Hand Taiyang and Hand Shaoyin, resulting from accumulated heat and worry. It is urgent to clear heat and attack toxins, using amber and rhinoceros horn ointment, Huanglian Disinfectant Decoction, Ziyin Dan, and Wujin San as options. For those who are robust, one gold pill should be administered. If treatment is delayed and it ruptures through the throat, it may lead to death.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion of Swelling and Pain in the Throat</strong></p>
<p>The throat and the pharynx are not the same. The throat is the gateway for breathing from the lungs, primarily responsible for exhalation rather than inhalation; the pharynx is the pathway for food and water from the stomach, primarily responsible for inhalation rather than exhalation. The throat and pharynx regulate breathing and control ascending and descending, acting as critical gateways of the body. The classics say: &quot;The illness arising from the foot&#39;s lesser yin manifests as thirst, dry tongue, swollen pharynx, shortness of breath, dry throat, and pain.&quot; The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: &quot;Evil influences on the foot&#39;s lesser yin channels cause swelling and pain in the throat, preventing food intake.&quot; Additionally, it says: &quot;The channels of the foot&#39;s lesser yin run through the throat and connect to the root of the tongue.&quot; Therefore, any throat pain is a disease of the lesser yin, with distinctions of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess. The fire of the lesser yin surges upward like galloping horses, clashing at the throat where the energies are tightly locked. This causes the qi to become stagnant, resulting in swelling or pain. The symptoms must include internal heat, dry mouth, reddened face, and phlegm surging upward; the pulse at the wrist will be rapid yet weak. This is due to the depletion of kidney water, leaving the fire of the yuan (original) unchecked. One must use a large dose of Six-Flavor Rehmannia, Asparagus, and Five-Flavor remedy to be taken as a decoction. If there is excessive desire leading to depletion of the original yang with unrooted fire wandering uncontrolled in the throat, one must use a large dose of Eight-Flavor Kidney Qi Pill, decocted and cooled to drink, to draw fire back to its source for a chance of rescue. This treatment method for throat pain due to yin deficiency aligns with what Zhu says about treating upper body diseases by addressing the lower body.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The throat of a person resembles a curved pipe; when the fire burns within, if water is poured in from above, the pipe will explode violently. Only below the stove, when a basin of water is reflected, the above fire will extinguish; this is one proof of treating an upper ailment by addressing the lower part. </p>
<p>Among these conditions, there are milk worms and throat worms, which have different names. Swelling on both sides of the throat is called double worm, while swelling on one side is called single worm. The treatment involves dipping a goose feather in rice vinegar to clear the phlegm from the throat, then using the goose feather to induce a cough, aiming to expel the purple blood from the worm for resolution; or grinding a purple gold ingot would also work. If it doesn&#39;t disperse, a small knife can be used to pierce and release the purple blood for recovery. </p>
<p>There is an ancient method to puncture the lesser shang point, which is very effective. Bloodletting with a knife or needle should be used in urgent cases, but there are also situations where it is not advisable. Xue refers to a case of a fifty-year-old man with a swollen and painful throat; when blood was drawn with a needle, his mind was clear, but his pulse was rapid and obscure, pressing it felt faint as if absent. It was said: &quot;There is form but no pain, it resembles a yang condition, and thus one should strongly nourish the yin. But if one injures the yin blood, he is bound to perish.&quot; Subsequently, he indeed passed away. This case serves as a warning against careless use of blades or needles.</p>
<p>For throat wind conditions, the swelling penetrates outward, causing numbness, itching, and pain; in such cases, the antidote called xionghuang pills may be used. </p>
<p>An ancient method involves soaking paper in castor oil, twisting it into a wick, igniting it, then extinguishing it to create smoke that can be inhaled. Instantly, saliva will flow from the mouth and nose, and the jaw will relax, allowing for treatment directly at the afflicted area to ensure recovery.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For conditions of slight yin deficiency accompanied by guest heat, diarrhea, sore throat, fullness in the chest, and irritability, use Pigskin Decoction. People generally recognize heat associated with sore throats but are unaware of the existence of cold sore throats. The classics state: when the sun is at its zenith, cold dampness prevails, and people suffer from sore throats with swelling in the jaw. Chen Zangqi utilized prepared aconite peeled at the navel, sliced, and coated with honey, to allow the honey to penetrate the throat. The sweet taste diminishes, and it can be replaced. In the winter, cold accumulates in the kidney channel, leading to sore throats and diarrhea; aconite decoction warms the channel and thus provides relief. </p>
<p>Furthermore, during severe weather, if there are many cases of severe cold in the villages, it indicates violent exposure to cold, suppressing heat externally while trapping it internally. One must avoid using cold medicines like alum and sulfur to prevent further constricting yang energy. Also, avoid nitrate powder and other cold tonics, as these can push cold deep into the body, leading to serious consequences. Instead, one should use dispersing formulas, similar to Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Sweet Tangerine Decoction.</p>
<p>There are also cases of yang toxin sore throats treated with Shengma Decoction, and yin toxin sore throats treated with Licorice Decoction. If medications for the sore throat prove ineffective, this is not actually a throat issue but pertains to a single red thread that appears in the nose like hair, with a black bubble the size of a cherry dangling to the throat&#39;s entrance, preventing the intake of food and drink. In this case, use a straight and solitary root of ox knee, clean it thoroughly, and mix three to five drops of quality vinegar. Grind finely and apply two or three drops into the nostrils. This will sever the thread and burst the bubble, bringing immediate relief.</p>
<p>Should there be persistent pain in the throat with chronic sores that refuse to heal, this is likely due to Yumberry ulcerative toxin, which should be primarily treated with Bi Xie Decoction.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Throat Closure Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The throat is the passageway for qi; when it is open, it is beneficial, but when it is blocked, it causes harm, regardless of its primary or secondary causes. Therefore, it requires urgent treatment. Now, if we examine the various teachings of the ancients, and draw connections accordingly, we find the vital means for saving lives emerge clearly.</p>
<p>For emergencies involving severe throat closure, the prescription of Xiong Huang Jie Du Wan is advised. This condition directly relates to life and death; urgent treatment results in survival, whereas delayed treatment leads to death. The herbs in this formula—Xiong Huang can break down stagnant qi, Ba Dou helps expel thick phlegm, and Yu Jin disperses stagnant blood—can effectively address this closure.</p>
<p>For those with throat closure lasting several days that prevents eating, Xie Yan San can induce vomiting to clear phlegm, and once the phlegm is expelled, the illness is resolved. The sharp properties of Zao Jiao can break down stagnant qi, while the salty and bitter nature of Bai Fan can promote the release of thick phlegm; repeated expulsion will lead to the resolution of the illness.</p>
<p>For throat pain, Gan Ju Fang Feng Tang is recommended. The sweetness of Gan Cao mitigates urgent sensations in the throat; the bitterness of Jie Geng helps lower qi in the throat; the spiciness of Fang Feng can disperse blockage in the throat.</p>
<p>For throats affected by wind, applying Ba Dou oil on paper, twisting it into a strip, igniting it, and extinguishing it immediately after smoke rises allows the patient to open their mouth and apply the smoky end to the throat. After a moment, the expulsion of dark blood will alleviate the symptoms, and the patient can then eat porridge and drink. This approach, where heat from the fire reaches the Ba Dou oil, disperses blockages with the fire, flushes with Ba Dou, and expels through smoke, is a comprehensive strategy for effective relief.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>External Medicine Authentic Text</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shigong (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>It is asked: Sore throat pertains to the lungs, yet its causes are varied, with distinctions such as虚火 (empty fire) and实火 (full fire), tight throat and slow throat. Additionally, the throat is the gateway for the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys for respiration, as well as the pathway for food, sound, and excretion. This connection affects the entire body and can be harmful quickly. Hence, it is said, &quot;Look at the throat of a running horse,&quot; without delay. </p>
<p>In cases of empty fire, the color is pale with slight swelling, the pulse is thin and fine, urination is clear, and bowel movements are smooth. This is due to excessive thinking, insufficient central qi, and the spleen being unable to protect adequately, leading to easy ascent of empty fire. The discomfort first manifests as dryness in the throat, hindering food intake, causing coughs with phlegm, and difficulty in breathing, resulting in a coating that resembles moss, similar to shrimp skin, often irritating the throat. It feels like a hard object lodged in the throat, leading to vomiting of sour fluids and spitting out sweet saliva. In severe cases, there is a white coating on the tongue, pale lips, hoarseness of voice, and frequent coughing with phlegm. </p>
<p>All these symptoms arise from insufficient vitality of empty fire, and in treating this, one should not hastily use cooling medicines. For morning pain, it relates to qi deficiency, treated with Qi-invigorating decoction modified with Mai Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Niu Bang, and Yuan Shen. For afternoon pain, it relates to yin deficiency, treated with Four Substance Decoction modified with Huang Lian, Zhi Mu, Jie Geng, and Yuan Shen. If these do not prove effective, ginger should be added to guide the treatment, serving as an auxiliary method as well.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Real fire arises from excessive consumption of rich wine, indulging in fatty foods, piling up heavy bedding, and eating spicy and hot meals, leading to an accumulation of heat within. Over time, this stirs the fire and generates phlegm, resulting in a swollen throat. In severe cases, wind phlegm clogs it up, closing off the throat&#39;s entrance. Soon, fluids cannot enter, and the voice cannot be heard; this manifests as a tight throat and throat wind. If medication is ineffective, one should first use acupuncture to prick the throat, draining toxic blood. Then, applying tung oil with chicken feathers, one can induce the expulsion of thick phlegm, ensuring the phlegm and toxins are fully eliminated, allowing the throat entrance to relax so that soups and medicines can enter, and the voice can return. </p>
<p>For those who experience tightly clenched teeth that are hard to open, one must urgently pierce the minor seal to draw blood, which will cause the closure to open. If the needle probing does not expel phlegm and the voice sounds like a creaking saw while the nose lifts with phlegm and gasps, with fluids unable to enter and the voice silent, that indicates a true life-threatening condition. </p>
<p>There are also conditions such as throat carbuncles, throat paralysis, milk moth, and palatal abscesses. Although the afflicted may swell causing the throat entrance to be partially obstructed, the condition can still appear serious while the throat passage remains both wide and tight. These are all standard conditions, and although severe, they are manageable. One should use a golden key to expel phlegm and saliva, and administer a clearing broth to promote the release of accumulated heat. For pus swelling, it should be drained, what is damaged and painful should be nourished, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In general, failing to let blood release for a closed throat, not eliminating phlegm for throat wind, not draining pus for throat carbuncles, and not needling or cauterizing for throat paralysis or milk moth are all improper practices. Furthermore, cases of phlegm fire causing coughs, which injure the throat, cannot be treated successfully.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The initial onset of red, swollen pain, with a clear voice and no simultaneous internal or external evidence, is mild. Once it has become swollen and painful, with the throat half open and half closed, and there is slight expectoration of phlegm, along with some intake of food, it is manageable. If the throat is swollen and closed, with a tight jaw, unclear speech, phlegm obstructing airflow, and a weak voice, it is dangerous. If the throat is suddenly closed, phlegm and saliva are obstructing, the mouth cannot open, and there is difficulty in breathing, it is fatal. Following sores, if toxicity accumulates in the throat leading to swelling, pain, and decay, making breathing unbearable and the voice hoarse, it is serious. Chronic cough due to phlegm heat, with deficiency of Yang rising, causing injury to the throat, results in hoarseness and a red face, which is also fatal.</p>
<p>Treatment methods:<br>For initial swelling and pain, with alternating cold and heat, along with dizziness and tightness, the evil is exterior and should be dispersed. If swelling and pain are accompanied by heat and a strong pulse with constipation, it indicates an internal evil and should be purged. For swelling and pain with cold and heat, dry mouth and intense thirst, and a large, strong pulse, it is advisable to both release the exterior and purge from within. When there is swelling and pain in the throat with significant phlegm obstruction, a flushed face and dry mouth indicate the evil is above, thus, it should be expelled. For a closed throat with phlegm, obstructing airflow and difficulty opening the mouth, first puncture the Shaoshang point and then proceed with expulsion. If there is already swelling and pain, with throat obstruction and inability to ingest liquids, and pus has formed, it requires urgent needling. If the swelling and pain are slightly red, with a weak pulse, and pain occurs in the afternoon, it indicates Yin deficiency and should nourish Yin and reduce fire; if the swelling and pain are white, with excessive expectoration in the morning, suggesting Yang deficiency, then the treatment should strengthen the spleen and tonify the middle.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Throat Abscess</h3>
<p>The throat abscess arises outside the pharynx, with swelling and pain in the center, hindering eating and drinking, with redness, swelling, and heat, requiring drainage of pus. If it is soft and painful, needling is indicated; internally take tonifying medication, and apply jade-red ointment to help heal and close the mouth. In cases of internal erosion with fluids oozing from the hole, treatment has been effective for several individuals, and it is harmless.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>In ancient texts, the condition of throat obstruction is distinguished into eighteen types, all being categorized as &quot;yang fire&quot; by ancient scholars. However, although many of these patterns arise from fire, some do not originate from fire and must be examined closely. Fire can be true or false; true fire symptoms can be cleared, while false fire symptoms cannot be cleared and indicate water deficiency. Furthermore, there can be cases of excessive yin obstructing yang, indicating true cold symptoms. Therefore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;The sun at the spring, cold dominance leads to pain in the throat and swelling of the jaw.&quot; This is precisely the meaning; why do later generations not investigate this? The throat obstruction involves various channels, including lesser yang, yangming, jueyin, and shaoyin, each with different manifestations of deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="interlaced-block original">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>盖少阳、厥阴木火之脏，热证固多，阳明为水谷之海，而胃气直透咽喉，故又惟阳明之火为最盛。欲辨此者，但察其以情志郁怒而起者，多属少阳、厥阴，以口服肥甘辛热太过而起者，多属阳明。凡患此者，多宜以实火论治。至若少阴之候，则非此之比，盖少阴之脉，络于横骨，终于会厌，系于舌本。凡阴火逆冲于上，多为喉痹，但少阴之火，有虚有实，不得类从火断。若果因实火，自有火证火脉，亦易知也。若因酒色过度，以致真阴亏损者，此肾中之虚火证也，非壮水不可。<a id="orig-75p" href="#trans-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The organs related to the Lesser Yang and Jueyin, being associated with wood and fire, indeed often manifest heat conditions. The Yangming, as the sea of food and water, allows the stomach qi to directly reach the throat, thus the fire of Yangming becomes the most abundant. To discern this, one only needs to observe that when emotional disturbances arise from frustration and anger, they mostly belong to the Lesser Yang and Jueyin, whereas those resulting from excessive consumption of rich, sweet, and spicy foods typically pertain to Yangming. For those suffering from this, it is generally appropriate to treat according to the principle of full fire.</p>
<p>As for the conditions related to the Lesser Yin, they are not comparable to these. The pulse of the Lesser Yin runs along the transverse bones, ending at the epiglottis, and is connected to the root of the tongue. When the Yin fire rises and causes a reverse flow upward, it often leads to throat obstruction. However, the fire of the Lesser Yin can either be empty or full and should not simply be classified as fire. If it indeed arises from full fire, there will be corresponding fire symptoms and clear pulse manifestations, which are also easy to identify. Conversely, if it is caused by excessive indulgence in alcohol and sexuality, leading to true Yin deficiency, this indicates a deficiency fire in the kidneys, and it cannot be supported by strong water.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is a vacuous fire below that clashes with the Yang above; this is the fire without a root, namely the true cold condition in the kidneys, which cannot be treated without warming and supplementing the life gate. Although these various scriptures differ significantly, the differences between deficiency and excess are rarely understood by later generations. Only the &quot;Chushi Yishu&quot; discusses the examination of the upper conditions in relation to the lower, which indeed reflects the words of the Dao.</p>
<p>The conditions of the throat are generally referred to as fire; though there are many terms, some do not require precise distinction, yet there are others that must be differentiated. For instance, the single and double breast swellings and the throat wind are different. The swelling on both sides of the throat is called double breast swelling, while swelling on one side is called single breast swelling. Their shape must be round and protruding like a pearl, and they belong to the category of abscesses that form in the throat; therefore, they often release toxins and may require lancing to expel the blood for recovery.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is a wind that constricts the throat, the area will become red and swollen, not often purulent, and it need not bleed. Just reduce the heat, and the swelling will subside on its own. This is why the conditions differ, and there should be a proper method of treatment. </p>
<p>Pang said: The disease caused by repressed qi, in ancient texts, is referred to as kidney cold damage. This refers to those who have been suddenly exposed to intense cold, causing toxic qi to become trapped in the Shaoyin channel. Initially, there may be no illness, but after a period of ten days or months, symptoms may arise, with a faint pulse. The approach should be to treat it like cold damage, not as a throat blockage disease. </p>
<p>Next, there will likely be diarrhea. In my humble opinion, this symptom commonly occurs. It is necessary to utilize the fire of the Shaoyin and Shaoyang, along with the cold influence of the Taiyang and the dampness of the Taiyin, compounded with the evil of wind and cold, all of which can bring about this condition. Therefore, when treating this, there’s no need to specifically address the throat blockage; instead, focus on expelling the external evil, and the throat will heal on its own. For instance, many formulas containing Chai Hu and various scattered methods can be adjusted accordingly for use.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Treatment</h3>
<p>For fire-related throat obstruction, it is best to focus on drinking a decoction aimed at resolving it; if the fire is not severe, a shift in the decoction can help. When there is excess liver and gallbladder fire, the main ingredients should be peony, gardenia, and gentian. For excess stomach fire, gypsum should be the primary ingredient. If there is severe constipation, larger doses of rhubarb and Glauber&#39;s salt should be added to relieve the bowel and reduce the fire naturally. If the fire rises to the upper body and causes heat to accumulate in the head, face, and throat, it is crucial to clear and descend it; never use remedies to disperse wind or raise yang, as this will only cause the fire to further flare up from within. As the classics state, &quot;Suppress the high,&quot; which refers directly to this situation; it does not mean that obstructed fire should be released or that raising yang is needed. Scholars must discern this clearly and not mistake its essence.</p>
<p>Regarding external treatment for fire-related swelling and pain, it is best to grind the seeds of the bitter cucumber with vinegar, then use a goose quill to swab the throat to remove phlegm; alternatively, dilute it with some water to avoid excessive acidity, and periodically gargle without swallowing, expelling phlegm for better results. After gargling, use a spoon to blow the decoction, and still take the herbal medicine internally for guaranteed recovery. If the fire is trapped above, food remedies like snow pear juice or mung bean drinks are ideal. In regions where pears are scarce, good radish juice can be pounded and mixed with spring water, adding a little starch to blend it, and sipped slowly; this will both eliminate phlegm and clear heat.</p>
<p>For cases involving single or double moth larvae, if the toxicity is mild and there is no formation of pus, treatment can help disperse it; if the condition is severe and critical, it is essential to perform bloodletting to hasten recovery.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is due to urgency and thus cannot be helped but must be used. Furthermore, in ancient practices, using a three-edged needle to puncture the Shaoshang point to induce bleeding is said to treat throat obstruction and achieve immediate relief. </p>
<p>For throat obstruction due to Yin deficiency, symptoms include internal heat, thirst, dryness of the throat, and possibly red lips and flushed cheeks, with phlegm and saliva accumulating. However, the pulse must be weak, and although the six pulses may be rapid, they feel floating and soft with no strength. One should observe if there has been excessive indulgence in alcohol or erotic desires, or if the individual is naturally deficient in Yin energy, experiencing fatigue and weakness. This indicates a deficiency in kidney Yin, where water fails to restrain fire. When fire is severe, it is advised to use the Eight Ingredients Decoction for nourishing Yin, or modifications of the One Yin Decoction. If there is mild fire, a dislike for cold substances, soft stools, and urine that is not hot, then the Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Decoction or similar preparations should be applied. If caused by excessive worry and mental strain alongside active heart fire, the Two Yin Decoction should be used.</p>
<p>For throat obstruction due to Yang inversion, if the fire does not return to its source, the fire becomes a guest in the throat, leading to symptoms of heat above and cold below, distinctly different from typical fire patterns. In such cases, one should only find the six pulses weak, without a slippery or strong indication; moreover, there are no fire symptoms in the lower body and the abdomen dislikes cold. These signs typically arise from indulgence in lust harming essence, excessive diarrhea damaging the kidneys, or the absence of real fire combined with excessive consumption of cold substances which harms Yang energy. For this condition, urgent use of the Tranquil Yin Decoction is recommended, followed by the Eight-Ingredient Rehmannia Decoction; alternatively, dissolving honey with Aconite in the mouth is also effective. If further cold is employed, it will certainly lead to dire consequences.</p>
<p>Throat obstruction due to Yang deficiency does not arise from a throat issue caused by Yang deficiency; rather, it is throat obstruction stemming from pre-existing Yang deficiency.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are those whose throat ailments are caused by excessive aggression, resulting in harm to the stomach&#39;s energy; some struggle with food and drink, leading to empty storerooms, which also harms the stomach&#39;s energy; and there are others whose energy is inherently weak, and who cannot withstand fatigue, causing harm to the stomach&#39;s energy. Generally, when there is inner deficiency of middle energy and external pressure causing pain, it often results in the departure of original yang, with a floating and scattered pulse, or a weak and thin pulse, leading to a snoring-like sound and sputum as if being cut with a saw. This indicates a severe depletion of the lungs and stomach, and one should promptly restore the original energy by simmering ginseng alone, and sip it slowly with peace of mind; if there is excessive phlegm, bamboo juice or ginger juice may be added. If the remedy is delayed, there may be dire consequences; treating it with approaches for excess heat will bring disaster as quickly as a snap of the fingers.</p>
<p>For throat ulcer conditions, those who are generally weakened from yin deficiency often suffer from this illness; the symptoms include swollen and ulcerated throats that fail to heal over long periods. This is a case of substantial water deficiency and latent fire, and should be treated using methods for yin deficiency and throat ailments. If there is frequent coughing due to lung heat, the treatment should involve preparations like Si Yin Decoction. In cases where there are ulcers in the throat that are painful and broken, it is advisable to use Niuhuang Yijing Powder for blowing and applying, while also internally taking nourishing agents for true yin to facilitate complete recovery.</p>
<p>Plague-induced throat ailments arise from the atmospheric plague&#39;s influence, presenting with throat pain and swelling of the neck, particularly severe swelling of the head and face, especially in the northern regions. This illness is commonly referred to as &quot;toad plague&quot; among the people, or also called &quot;cormorant plague&quot; and &quot;big head plague.&quot; This condition, characterized by extreme dampness and heat, is most dangerous, and one should clear the accumulated heat from all meridians, or drain the heat of the Yangming channel, taking care to assess urgency in treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The intention is to indicate that the wind pathogen obstructs the throat passages; it cannot be resolved without using pungent and warming herbs. Thus, I added fresh ginger to Erchen Decoction, brewed it, and administered it, but there was no effect at all. I intended to use Dushen Decoction to save the lungs; however, seeing the condition so dire, I feared it would stir grievances and slander, and I ultimately did not dare to take action. Other physicians, upon seeing this, could only stand by without taking any measures. In this way, one person passed away after a day and night. Subsequently, another person met the same fate. As for these two individuals, I still do not understand the cause of their illness, which remains a lifelong perplexity, and I feel deeply ashamed. Nevertheless, it must be that the lung qi was completely exhausted. If another case arises, I fear that Dushen Decoction alone cannot provide salvation. Therefore, I record this here, hoping that future gentlemen will take it to heart and consider it carefully.</p>
<p>When there is poison from the Yangmei fruit causing ulceration and pain in the throat that does not heal after a long time, this is not a case of throat blockage, but rather a Yangmei sore toxin. One should use Xianyi Liang Decoction; in severe cases, prepare a decoction of earth Poria and swallow Wubao Pill. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Swelling and Pain</h3>
<p>When a person has a throat condition with significant swelling, which is neither a goiter nor a tumor, the pain may come and go. Externally, there are colorful patterns visible, and when pressed, it feels both empty and solid. This is due to phlegm disease that manifests like a tumor but is neither truly one nor a goiter. The prescription consists of 9 grams each of seaweed, banxia (Pinellia), white mustard seed, fritillaria, ginseng, platycodon (bellflower), and nanking (south stars), 15 grams of poria, 3 grams each of kelp and licorice, and 0.3 grams of aconite, decocted in water for oral administration. This formula is a miraculous medicine to dissolve phlegm in the upper burner. Seaweed and kelp help remove external signs of the goiter and eliminate the strange colorful patterns. The key is to resolve phlegm without damaging qi, thereby keeping the stomach qi strong and facilitating the transformation of phlegm. With one dose, one knows; two doses can eliminate most of it; three doses can completely dissolve it; and four doses will prevent recurrence. This formula can also treat goiter symptoms and is remarkably effective.</p>
<p>If a person suddenly has swelling and pain in the throat, accompanied by double eyelids, such that they cannot eat, they could die within five days without food. However, this condition of real fire is easier to treat. For real fire, one can use mountain bean root, and herbs like qin (skullcap), lian (lotus), banxia, chaihu (bupleurum), licorice, platycodon, and tianhuafeng (trichosanthes) for immediate relief. Yet, the condition of false fire occurs when kidney fire does not settle in the mingmen (life gate) but floats between the throat. Its symptoms resemble those of real fire, but are heavier at night and lighter in the morning. Conversely, with real fire, symptoms are heavier in the morning and lighter at night. Real fire causes dryness and cracking in the mouth; false fire does not create much thirst but shows a slippery tongue without cracks. Use this method of distinguishing symptoms to avoid mistakes.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>These虚痛s (false pains), if treated with methods meant for real fire, are like a person who has fallen into a well and then adds stones to it. Therefore, not only should one avoid cold and cooling treatments, but one should also refrain from using dispersing methods, as虚火 (false fire) must be supplemented. However, merely supplementing kidney water, while water can control fire, may only alleviate the situation slightly, as the fire is too intense and hard to subdue. It is better to supplement fire with water, leading the fire back to its original source, causing its force to vanish in an instant. One should use the Y引火 Decoction: prepared Rehmannia and Fritillaria (each 1 tael), white mustard seed (3 qian), Chinese dogwood and yam (each 4 qian), northern spices and cinnamon (each 2 qian), poria (5 qian), then decoct with water and take as a dose, which will calm the phlegm, relieve the pain, and eliminate the swelling; two doses will bring complete recovery. The prepared Rehmannia, Chinese dogwood, and spices primarily reinforce kidney water; poria and yam also benefit essence and facilitate water, assisting the descent of cinnamon; Fritillaria dissipates the floating fire above; while white mustard seeds eliminate obstructive phlegm. Once the upper focus is relaxed and the lower focus receives the warmth of cinnamon, is there any chance that the fire of the dragon and thunder will not return to its root in the mingmen? One dose is effective. The unpredictable workings of spirits and ghosts are even better than the Eight-Flavored Rehmannia Decoction. If the throat is swollen and blocked, and not even a spoonful of water can be swallowed, how will this formula be applied? Furthermore, there is another method: use one piece of aconite, five qian of broken old paper, ground into powder, mix into a paste, shape it into a patch as large as a teacup, apply it to the center of the sole, and warm it with fire for a while. After one period, the throat will widen, opening a pathway to take medicine.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Moth of Milk</strong></p>
<p>There are some who suffer from a dual moth condition, which others mistakenly attribute to heat. The throat swells painfully, phlegm incessantly thick like sawdust, and not a single drop of tea can be swallowed. Isn’t this a sign of heat? Yet, despite the intense pain, it becomes somewhat lighter by morning; although the throat is swollen, the tongue will not be dry; although there is abundant phlegm, it will not be yellow and clotted. This is a sign of false heat. If one hastily uses cold and cool medicines for urgent relief, it may seem to soothe the throat momentarily, but soon the heat intensifies even more. People assume that the cooling medicine was insufficient and add more cold remedies, which only aggravates the condition. It is urgent to prick the Shaoshang point to draw a little blood; this will surely open a line of passage in the throat. It is essential to use one qian of Aconite, one liang of Rehmannia, four qian of Cornus, three qian each of Ophiopogon, Chinese Amomum, and Achyranthes, and five qian of Poria; decoct and administer down the throat, and a sound shall resonate, causing the fiery heat to dissipate immediately.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fire of the Lesser Yin is like a galloping horse. When a person loses a significant amount of kidney water, the original Yang in the kidneys cannot settle down, as there is no water to nourish the fire, which must then rise. Daily, it surges upward and constricts the throat, making it unable to properly function, leading to swellings and pains resembling double moths, though they are not actually double moths. The key lies in using spicy and warm drugs like aconite to guide the fire of the dragon and thunder down into the dwelling. The fire of the dragon and thunder represents the fire of the heart; it enjoys water but dislikes fire. Therefore, herbs like cooked rehmannia and shan zhu yu, which are purely nourishing for Yin, are used to give the fire a place to return, preventing it from boiling over. This is due to counteracting its reverse tendencies. What it enjoys is the true Yin water, not the cold and cooling type; what it dislikes is the fire of邪气 (xieqi), not the spicy and warm fire. As for the condition of having heavier days and lighter nights, it is the easiest to treat.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition of the &quot;yin moth&quot; is due to a deficiency of kidney water, where the fire cannot be contained below and thus rises above. The throat is narrow, preventing the fire from being released directly, resulting in the formation of a &quot;moth,&quot; which resembles a moth but is not. The pain is lighter in the morning and heavier in the afternoon, exacerbating by dusk. It is relieved by heat and worsened by coolness. In severe cases, even a drop of water cannot go down the throat. If treated as an external wind-heat condition using herbs like mountain soy root, qin (scutellaria), lian (lotus), and gardenia, the pain may increase and the throat will remain obstructed, potentially leading to death. Only by nourishing the yin deficiency and employing methods that redirect fire to its source can the pain be alleviated. This is known as the &quot;Transforming Moth Pill,&quot; consisting of one liang each of reheated land (shudihuang), shanzhu yu (cornelian cherry), and mai dong (ophiopogon), along with 1 qian of fu zi (prepared aconite) and 3 qians of che qian zi (plantago) and 2 qians of bei wu wei zi (schisandra). These ingredients are decocted in water for ingestion. This formula greatly nourishes the kidney water, rather than treating the pain of the &quot;moth.&quot; Strengthening the water will quell the fire; thus, the pain dissipates, making this method exceptionally effective.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states that the acupuncture methods for throat obstruction from the &quot;Internal Canon&quot; have two types: one based on the meridians passing through the throat and the other relating to other diseases that cause throat obstruction, encompassing the six meridians. The first involves the hand and foot Yangming meridians. It specifies that for throat obstruction preventing speech, one should needle the foot Yangming, and if speech is possible, needle the hand Yangming. It further states that the Stomach Meridian of the Foot Yangming runs from Dàyíng in front to Rénjīng, circling the throat; the resulting diseases include swelling in the neck and throat obstruction, requiring treatment based on the conditions of excess, deficiency, heat, and cold. Another mention is that the branch of the Foot Yangming, known as Fēnglóng, is located eight cun above the ankle, diverging to the Taiyin; if the pathogenic qi reverses, it leads to acute throat obstruction and muteness, requiring treatment at this branch point.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is also said: The hand Yangming channel of the large intestine causes illnesses such as throat obstruction, from excessive heat or cold descending. </p>
<p>Secondly: For the hand Shaoyang, the classic states: The Sanjiao hand Shaoyang channel emerges above the clavicle, connecting behind the ear. When it is disturbed, it causes throat swelling and obstruction, from excessive heat or cold descending. It is further stated: When evil influences invade the hand Shaoyang collaterals, they cause throat obstruction. To treat this, needle the nails of the middle and index fingers, taking care to insert the needle as deep as a garlic leaf, with immediate effect in robust individuals, and delayed effect in the elderly. Treat the left side for the right side, and the right side for the left side.</p>
<p>Thirdly: The channels that pass through the throat are two. The classic states: The liver meridian of the foot Jueyin runs behind the throat, hence when there is pain behind the throat, this is the corresponding point. It also states: The kidney meridian of the foot Shaoyin traverses the diaphragm of the liver and runs along the throat.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What Dou Hanqing refers to as &quot;必准&quot; (must be accurate) pertains to addressing the blockage in the throat. </p>
<p>Fourthly: There is a condition where other diseases cause throat paralysis. The classic text states: When the heart coughs, the throat feels tight and obstructed, and in severe cases it leads to swelling and paralysis of the throat. To treat this, one should stimulate the heart&#39;s associated point, which is the Daling point.</p>
<p>For treating throat paralysis, use Fenglong, Yongquan, and Guanchong. In severe cases, utilize a small three-edged needle alongside a writing brush to simulate applying medication directly to the paralyzed throat, then puncture to release purple blood immediately for recovery.</p>
<p>For throat blockage, use Shaoshang, Yinbai, Shaochong, and Yongquan.</p>
<p>In cases of throat paralysis, if the jaw swells like a surge and water cannot be swallowed: stimulate the Shaoshang to cause bleeding; on the back of the big toe, at the last joint, apply three punctures with a three-edged needle to draw blood; and at Yanggu, puncture three times.</p>
<p>For throat paralysis, needle the Shaoyin point, located at the wrist along the artery behind the little finger. Insert the needle three times and supplement.</p>
<p>According to the Inner Canon, there are two moxibustion and acupuncture methods for throat swellings and pains. The first involves using the foot Shaoyin point.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classic text states: The kidney channel corresponds to the lesser yin; the illnesses it causes are swelling of the throat, difficulty breathing, and pain in the throat. It also says: If there is swelling in the throat that cannot be ingested, and saliva cannot be expelled, one should puncture just before the bone to draw blood, which will immediately relieve the condition. Puncture the left side for the right side, and the right side for the left. Furthermore, it says: When evil energies affect the collateral of the lesser yin, it causes throat pain that makes it impossible to eat, anger without reason, and the upward flow of qi troubling the throat. Puncture centrally beneath the feet three times for a total of six punctures, which will immediately alleviate the condition. Puncture the left for the right, and the right for the left. </p>
<p>Secondly, one should access the hand taiyang. The classic states: The small intestine channel of the hand taiyang causes throat pain and swelling of the jaw if it is influenced by movement, which can be examined for its presence of deficiency or excess, cold or heat, and treated accordingly. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions moxibustion and puncturing the throat, specifically noting two techniques. The first technique involves accessing the Yanglingquan. It states: For those with gallbladder disease, who sigh frequently, experience a bitter mouth, vomit residual bile, and have a thick sensation in the throat resulting in frequent saliva secretion, one should access the Yanglingquan. This is the first technique. The second technique involves accessing the Daling.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The scriptures say: The condition of heart cough manifests as a throaty sensation, feeling like a blockage. This indicates the need to treat the heart&#39;s corresponding acupoint. The &quot;Introduction to Medicine&quot; states: When there is an accumulation of fire, one should induce bleeding through acupuncture, which is the same principle as sweating. The more blood is drawn, the better the recovery. For those with needle sores, ginger juice mixed with warm water should be sipped frequently. Generally, for blood blisters caused by tightness in the joints, it is most effective to use needles; for those not visible, have the patient hold water in their mouth and use a reed to prick the nostril to induce bleeding, which is quite effective.</p>
<p>The &quot;Examination of Medical Formulas&quot; mentions: In the case of acute throat obstruction, needle the area just outside the nail of the patient’s thumb, approximately the size of a chives leaf, with men on the left and women on the right—bleeding indicates effectiveness. If the situation is critical, needle both thumbs, which will yield prompt results. The throat is connected to the lungs, and the acupuncture point is Shaoshang, which is a lung aperture; hence, bleeding leads to recovery.</p>
<p>If the throat appears red and swollen, needle from the side to induce bleeding for recovery. It is essential to avoid piercing the Yamen point, as it could cause a loss of voice.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Collection&quot; states: To treat throat obstruction, have the patient bend their thumb at the second joint and keep it curled, then open their mouth and bite firmly. This will facilitate the flow of qi, disperse the blood vessels, and the swelling will subside. The &quot;Key Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; suggests that for throat wind, one can push on the affected area to clear the lung meridian and then breathe in while blowing out.</p>

<p>The &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; in Hua Tuo&#39;s biography states: Tuo once traveled and saw someone suffering from a blocked throat. He told them: &quot;There used to be a pancake seller by the roadside whose pancakes were very sour; you can take three liters of his drink, and your ailment will surely disappear.&quot; Just as Tuo said, the patient immediately vomited a snake and then hung it on the cart to wait for Tuo. At that time, Tuo&#39;s young son was playing by the door and, seeing the situation, remarked to himself: &quot;There must be something by the guest&#39;s cart; it must be my grandfather.&quot; When the guest approached and looked, he saw a snake hanging on the wall, and realized its peculiarity.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Rituals of Filial Piety&quot; states: A woman fell ill with a swollen and obstructed throat, unable to swallow gruel or porridge. For several days, the swelling did not subside, and medicine was difficult to take while acupuncture was ineffective. A person suggested using angelica, schizonepeta, and licorice decocted in hot water for gargling, and cooling water to treat her hands. Within five or six days, the pain lessened and the swelling disappeared, allowing her to eat and drink as usual. Throat ailments are very urgent and should not be treated recklessly with needles or medicines.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasure Mirror of Health&quot; mentions: A son of the Liang family, due to damage from excessive heat and dampness, suffered from overflowing heart fire affecting the lungs. Therefore, mulberry root and earth bone bark, which are slightly bitter and cool, were used to lower the internal fire in the lungs and replenish energy, serving as the chief remedy. Huangqin and Zhimu, both bitter and cold, were used to treat the foul, fishy breath and clear the lung qi, acting as the minister. To gather lung qi, it is urgent to consume sour foods; the sourness of Schisandra helps gather lung qi, while Mai Men Dong is sweet, bitter, and cool, treating thick, sticky phlegm and dryness in the mouth and tongue, serving as an assistant. Platycodon, light, acrid, and warm, treats phlegm reversal and benefits the throat, serving as a messager. In the spring of the Wucheng year, many in the village suffered from throat paralysis, likely due to the invasion of the qi at the end of the previous year and the beginning of this year, which brought about the dual fire evils. A sweet orange decoction was used, adding Huangqin, Lian, Banxia, Jangcan, Shucanzizi, and Pueraria to dispel it. For those who were weak, ginseng, astragalus, and angelica were added. When water and gruel could not enter, a detoxifying wax gourd pill was first used, administered as a liquid; after phlegm was expelled, ginger juice was given. None who took the previous medicine failed to see remarkable results. However, if cold, sour substances were used excessively, they would be ineffective, as the evil would be trapped and unable to be released.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Miraculous Remedies&quot; states: Yang Lizhi, returning to Chuzhou from his post in Guangfu, developed an abscess in his throat, which grew swollen and then burst, causing pus and blood to flow continuously both day and night. He could neither eat nor sleep, and the physicians were at a loss for how to treat him. Coincidentally, Elder Yang Ji was summoned by the governor, and Lizhi&#39;s two sons hurriedly went to invite him. Upon arriving, he looked carefully for a long time and said, “There is no need to take the pulse; I already know what it is. However, this illness is quite peculiar; you must first consume one pound of fresh ginger slices before any medication can be administered. Otherwise, there is no other way.” After saying this, he left. The sons had difficulty accepting this advice and said, “How can we eat fresh ginger when there is pus and pain in the throat?” Lizhi replied, “Elder Ji’s medical knowledge is profound, and his words are not in vain; try taking a slice and see if you can swallow it. If not, then it won’t cause harm to stop altogether.” They then consumed the ginger, finding it surprisingly sweet and fragrant. They gradually increased the amount to about half a pound, and the pain began to ease. Once they consumed a full pound, they finally felt a spicy taste, and the pus and blood ceased immediately. They could drink congee without any obstruction. The next day, they invited Elder Ji to thank him and inquire further. He responded, “You live in the south and often eat partridges. This bird likes to eat pinellia, which can be toxic over time, hence the use of ginger to counter it. Now that the source of the illness has been cleared, there is no need for other medications.” One son recalled that in a Tang dynasty novel, it was recorded that Duke Cui Wei suffered from a similar ailment, and a physician named Liang Xin diagnosed it as food poisoning. When asked what he had eaten, he said he often enjoyed bamboo chicken, which tends to eat pinellia sprouts, and this was likely the source of the toxin. The physician then ordered ginger juice to be mixed and administered to him, resulting in recovery. This case is indeed similar to that.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A certain astrological scholar, exhausted and entering a room, felt his throat tightening with pain, phlegm rising, and his limbs suddenly becoming hot. This indicated a deficiency of yin with the upward excitement of yang. I prescribed a decoction of Ba-zhen Tang (Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction) with the addition of Fu Zi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In the winter of the Gui-Mao year, the Vice Minister Jiang Shichuan consulted me. His pulse was floating and slightly strong at the right inch, and he had sores in his mouth. I said, &quot;This is stomach fire affecting the lungs. You should have a light diet and be careful with your daily activities.&quot; In the autumn of the Jia-Chen year, he consulted me again, and his pulse at the chi position was flooding and rapid yet without strength. I said, &quot;This indicates that the lung metal cannot generate kidney water; you need to rest to nourish the source of transformation.&quot; He complained of dryness and pain in his throat and ears, and his limbs occasionally felt hot, saying that if there were a fire without root, his demise was certain. Later, he mentioned to Liu Guxia that Lizhai suspected his illness was doubtful. </p>
<p>Come the spring of the Yi-Si year, Guxia told me, &quot;Mr. Jiang&#39;s condition has already reached the critical point.&quot; We went to see him together, and indeed, his throat was swollen and ulcerated, with a more pronounced pulse. Some tried using hot herbs, which hastened his passing.</p>
<p>In another case, Wu Shangshe, over fifty years old, suffered from swollen and painful throat. Sometimes blood would be drawn with acupuncture. Though his mind was clear, his chi pulse was flooding and rapid, yet there was no regularity, and upon pressing it was weak as though nonexistent. I remarked, &quot;Though there is form, there is no pain; this is a manifestation of yang. You must supply the yin robustly. If you instead damage the yin blood, you will certainly die.&quot; Eventually, he did pass away. This condition was caused by kidney qi deficiency, with rootless fire flaring upwards. Only through the modified Bawei Pill could one hope to return the fire to its source and perhaps save him.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Within the cloud bridge of the government academy, there was a case of postnatal throat pain, and taking heat-clearing medications only worsened the condition. Upon examination, I determined it was due to a deficiency in the urinary bladder meridian. The pulse of the bladder ascends, reaching the neck and returning. I administered Ba Zhen Decoction, along with peony root, Chai Hu, and toasted black and yellow berberine, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>In another case, Shen Da Fang had occasional phlegm in the throat, which prompted him to look left and spit it out, resulting in neck pain so intense that he could not turn his head. By night, the symptoms worsened, including night sweats and cold, numb hands and feet. He required assistance to get up or lie down, and any movement caused pain radiating to the heart and abdomen, creating countless degrees of suffering for three to four days. When I examined him, I said: this is the result of anger provoking liver fire, causing the gallbladder to generate heat and the tendons to contract. I prescribed Liu Wei Di Huang Wan with added gardenia and Chai Hu to clear the liver fire and nourish gallbladder blood. Within a day, his laughter and movements returned to normal, and when he met with guests, they did not recognize him as the same person who had been ill just days before.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from throat pain that ulcerated after two months, followed by generalized pain in her muscles and bones. I suspected it was a case of Yangmei sore poison, so I first treated her with several doses of Bi Xie Decoction, which alleviated her condition. I then prescribed over twenty doses of Si Wu Decoction combined with Bi Xie and astragalus, leading to the resolution of all her symptoms.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child suffering from a mouth ailment for over a year, which spread to the whole body, was treated with powdered rhizoma of dioscorea mixed with milk. The mother also used boiled water for administration, and after a month, the child recovered.</p>
<p>A man initially suffered from a sore throat, followed by the appearance of various sores that were treated with light powders, but the condition recurred. After taking the previous medications again, the sores worsened, leading to severe ulceration of the hard palate, connecting with the nasal cavity. He had several lumps the size of peaches on his arms and wrists, which did not heal for over a year, showing evident signs of deficiency. I prescribed a treatment primarily with powdered rhizoma of dioscorea, along with remedies to strengthen the spleen, and he was stable after a month.</p>
<p>According to &quot;Qidong Yeyu&quot;: the illness of throat closure is rapid and severe. It has been passed down by predecessors to use only one ingredient, alum, but sometimes it does not always prove effective. In the year of Xinchou, while I was attending to my parent and returning from Fujian, I encountered many cases of this ailment on the way, with one family of more than ten people succumbing in a single night. The roads were silent, and travelers were fearful. Upon reaching Nanpu, an old doctor advised using duckbill胆矾 (alum) finely ground and mixed with strong vinegar for administration, which gave us courage on the way back, though we still did not know its ultimate efficacy.</p>
<p>One day, while my first son was supervising by the riverside, an old soldier who had been careful came to me in tears, asking for help, saying his elderly wife had suffered from severe throat closure for three days and was on the brink of death. I happened to have a small amount of medicine in my medicine chest, so I gave it to him and instructed him to use it as directed. The next day, he joyfully bowed in the courtyard, saying: &quot;As soon as she swallowed the medicine, she vomited profusely, releasing several pounds of phlegm, and she was cured.&quot; After that, whenever I treated several others, all showed immediate evidence of recovery. However, genuine alum is hard to find; those dedicated to health should not neglect to stock it for future use.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a></p></div>

<p>Autumn official Ye Ren&#39;an, whose constitution was primarily Yin deficient, suffered sudden throat swelling and alternating cold and heat due to anger, along with headaches, neck stiffness, and involuntary urination—the signs of liver fire. The liver governs sinews and the fiery condition caused swelling; excessive fire leads to blood depletion and muscle spasms, and overactivity of the liver resulted in urgent eye strain and neck tension, as well as weakness in the bladder causing involuntary urination. Thus, he was treated by needling the affected area to release toxic blood, and given prescriptions including Four Substances, Bupleurum, Gardenia, Scrophularia, and Licorice, leading to recovery.

<p>A Confucian scholar, after attending three lectures, suddenly had a swollen throat that obstructed his ability to speak, losing consciousness, with difficulty breathing and an influx of phlegm, sweating profusely, and experiencing weakness in his limbs.

He was treated with a dose of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added cinnamon, which immediately revived him.</p>
<p>The righteous man Gu Keming experienced throat pain, which developed into a fever at night. This was due to excessive liver fire with a deficiency in yin. He was treated with Si Wu Decoction combined with fried black Coptis,zhi mu, wheat ears, and five flavors, leading to his recovery. Later, due to overexertion, his throat swelled and closed up again. Acupuncture in the affected area caused bleeding; he was treated with Jie Geng Decoction to expel phlegm, leading to improvement. During mid-summer, he had a dry cough, hoarseness, thirst, and fever, with hot feet in the afternoon.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>An old man experienced a sore throat, which was particularly severe in the afternoon. He was cured by taking a decoction of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with a few pieces of pan-fried Huang Bo and Zhi Mu. </p>
<p>A man had painful swollen breasts, with a floating and rapid pulse, but no pus had formed yet. After needling to release bad blood, he took two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du San and the swelling resolved. </p>
<p>Another man also had painful swollen breasts and was unable to eat. The ulcer was white, and pus had formed. After needling, the pus came out, and he felt better. </p>
<p>A man experienced swelling and pain in the throat, with a pulse that was initially floating and rapid, then became deeper and more solid. After taking one dose of Fang Feng Tong Sheng San, he had a bowel movement, and the condition quickly improved. Following this, he took two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du San and the swelling disappeared. </p>
<p>One patient was almost breathless, but his heart was still warm. He urgently needled the affected area, and black blood was released, leading to his revival. Both Bao Fu Qing and Qiao Shi Yu had experienced this condition, and they were cured by needling to draw out the blood. Generally, throat conditions are caused by fire, which can be very harmful and act swiftly. It’s crucial to determine the urgency and whether pus has formed. </p>
<p>If there is swelling and blockage, death could occur in an instant; it&#39;s advisable to use a golden key to clear the affected area, expel phlegm and saliva, allowing air to flow freely. If, after expelling, it is still closed, then it is due to bad blood or toxic pus, and urgent needling is necessary; otherwise, it may not be treatable. </p>
<p>The ancients said: treating the fire causing throat blockage is akin to extinguishing a fire; there is no time to delay. Additionally, it’s said: “Ride a horse and inspect the throat closure.” Indeed! There are many methods for treating the throat, but only needling has the power to restore life. Even without needling, simply using the juice of Wan Nian Qing in the throat and expelling it can lead to recovery.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man experienced pain in his throat, with phlegm causing a blockage. I intended to treat him with Jingfang Baidu San, adding Lianqiao, Shanzhizi, Yuanshen, and Niubangzi. However, he had taken cool,甘寒 (sweet and cool) medicines to降火 (reduce fire), which instead intensified his fever and the swelling in his throat worsened. In an urgent move, I needled the Shaoshang points and continued with the previous medicine, adding Ma Huang to induce sweating, and all symptoms gradually subsided. Only a purple area in the throat remained painful, indicating it might lead to pus; thus, I removed Ma Huang from the previous medicine for one dosage, and once the pus discharged, he recovered. </p>
<p>For throat pain, if treated early or in mild cases, it is advisable to use Jingfang Baidu San to disperse it. If treatment is delayed or in severe cases, needling Shaoshang points is necessary. If blood stasis has formed, it must be needled at the affected area, and needling Shaoshang is also applicable. If the throat is still uncomfortable but not entirely resolved, it will surely lead to pus; however, once the pus is eliminated, recovery follows. If there is constipation, even after needling to release blood, one must use Fangfeng Tongsheng San to promote movement.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of a county magistrate suffering from a swollen and painful throat, with chills and fever, and a rapid pulse, it was determined that the illness stemmed from the interplay of the lesser yin heart fire and the lesser yang fire channels. This condition was particularly severe, and the best treatment was to bleed the affected area. However, he was fearful of needles, so I first treated him with a cooling decoction. The medicine emerged from his nose; in haste to perform acupuncture, his jaw had already stiffened, making it impossible to needle. Thus, I needled the two points at the lesser commerce, manually pressed out the black blood, and his mouth opened immediately. I then needled between his throat and treated it with the previous medicine and a gold key to blow the area, leading to instant relief. Additionally, I prescribed a decoction of ginseng and a detoxifying powder with the addition of scutellaria, coptis, and arnebia seeds. After four dosages, he stabilized. The classical text states: &quot;When fire is trapped, induce sweating or bleeding; it is one aspect of inducing sweat.&quot; The Hejian record states: &quot;The fire causing throat closure must be treated with the same urgency as rescuing a fire, with no negligence allowed.&quot; It is common to encounter cases where throat closure does not yield to bleeding, or throat wind persists without clearing phlegm, resulting in many being beyond help. For each case of throat swelling and pain, or ulceration and toxicity, I have successfully used a decoction of schizopeplus and detoxifying powder with the addition of scutellaria and coptis; for more severe cases, I prescribed a wind-dispersing detoxifying powder, which proved effective.</p>
<p>A Mr. Du experienced swelling and pain in the throat, with lesions on his tongue, and was initially treated with a cooling throat and detoxifying powder in two doses, followed by a ginseng and peony decoction, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A man in his thirties frequently suffered from ulcerations in his mouth and tongue, appearing as if lacking skin, or having throat-related conditions.

<p>I once treated a man with throat blockage by needling the Tai Xi point, causing half a cup of black blood to discharge, leading to recovery.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>　　《古今医统》曰：一人携二仆入京，其一忽患喉风胀满，气塞不通，命在须臾，询诸郡人云：有李家世医喉痹，即令仆往就医。李骇曰：证候甚危，犹幸来此，不然即死何疑。乃于笥中取一纸捻，用火点着，才烟起吹灭之，令仆张口刺于喉间，俄吐出紫血半合，即时气宽能言，及啖粥饮。掺药付之，立愈。其人神其药，窃访其秘，盖预以巴豆油涂纸，故施火即着，藉其毒气，往赴病处。<br>　　一人患咽喉肿痛，下食不得，身热头疼，大便不通。众医之论纷然，皆以为热当服凉药。一善医云：脉紧数是感寒所致。众医不从。善医者曰：我有法验得寒热。室中生火，用煎葱汤淋浴，若是热病，则此暖处必有汗而咽喉痛不减；若是感寒，虽浴无汗。患者信其言，遂人浴洗而无汗，就浴室中服麻黄汤一服，须臾大汗出，大便通，即时无事。众医服其神。凡辨热病感寒，用此法最妙。<a id="orig-167p" href="#trans-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;Ancient and Modern Medical Systems&quot; states: A man brought two servants into the capital, and one of them suddenly suffered from throat wind, swelling and blocking the airway, on the verge of death. He inquired of the local people and learned that there was a family of physicians named Li who specialized in throat ailments, so he ordered his servant to seek their help. Li Hai said: The condition is very dangerous; fortunately, you came here; otherwise, there would be no doubt of death. He then took a piece of paper from a box, rolled it, ignited it, and when the smoke rose, he quickly blew it out, instructing the servant to open his mouth and pierce the throat. Soon, the servant coughed out half a cup of purple blood, and at that moment, his breathing eased, allowing him to speak and eat porridge. After administering a powdery medicine, he was cured immediately. The man admired his remedy and secretly inquired about his secret; it was because he had previously coated the paper with dadura oil, so it ignited upon use, delivering its poisonous gas directly to the ailment.</p>
<p>Another person suffered from throat swelling and pain, unable to eat, with a fever and headache, and constipation. The opinions of the many doctors were conflicting; they all believed the heat required cooling medicine. A skilled physician said: The tight and rapid pulse is due to cold. The many doctors disagreed. The skilled physician said: I have a method to test for cold and heat. In the room, he lit a fire and used a decoction of scallions to steam the patient. If it were a heat illness, warm conditions would surely cause sweating, but if it were a cold, there would be no sweat, even with the bath. The patient trusted his words and bathed without sweating. In the bathing room, he took a dose of ephedra decoction; after a short while, he broke into a profuse sweat, his bowels moved, and he was well again. The other doctors admired his skill. Generally, discerning heat illness from cold using this method is most excellent.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Formulation Examination&quot; states: The &quot;Record of Famous Physicians&quot; mentions that when Princess Li Wang suffered from a throat abscess, her pain and swelling lasted for several days, and she could not eat or drink. When the medical officials were summoned, they all advised that she must use acupuncture and incision. The princess, upon hearing of needles and knives, cried and refused treatment. Due to the pain and inability to ingest water or food, a country doctor said: &quot;I won&#39;t use any knives or needles; I will only dip a fine point of a brush in medicine and apply it to the abscess, and it will burst forth immediately.&quot; The princess was pleased and ordered him to be called. After applying the medicine twice, pus and blood spilled out more than a cup, and she felt relief. After two days, the sore showed no issues, and she instructed that his method be provided. The doctor explained: &quot;I simply tied a needle to the brush tip and gently scraped until it burst; there is no other method.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;Orthodox Surgery&quot; states: A man had a swollen and painful throat, felt cold and fatigued, and his pulse was thin and strong. This indicated an exterior condition. A formula of Jingfang Baidu San was used, adding Burdock and Scrophularia, and the exterior symptoms retreated, but the swelling and pain remained. Another two doses of Scrophularia Detoxifying Decoction were administered, reducing the swelling and pain by half; after two more doses, he became stable.</p>
<p>Another man had a swollen and painful throat, with excessive phlegm. A gold key was used to first expel the thick phlegm, and Qingyan Lihge Decoction was employed to clear the accumulated heat. The swelling and pain slightly reduced, but it remained very red, indicating heat. Two doses of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction were given, with added Platycodon, and both the redness and swelling receded, leading to stability.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man who frequently drank strong liquor suddenly found his throat swollen and blocked, unable to speak with a stiff tongue and obstructed phlegm, putting him in a perilous condition. He first used a needle to prick the Shaoshang acupoint; his mouth was able to open. Then, he used tung oil and chicken feathers to expel thick phlegm, bringing up several bowls’ worth before his voice returned. He also used a needle on the swelling, which drew out purple blood, then rinsed with warm water and applied ice borax powder. He added Liangge San with Glauber’s salt and Tianhuafen to alleviate the accumulated heat, and finally prescribed two doses of Lianqiao San for stabilization.</p>
<p>A woman had a slightly swollen throat with a pale complexion, struggling to swallow. Upon examining her pulse, it was also faint and weak, indicating a deficiency in middle Qi and false heat. She was given two doses of Lizhong Decoction, which immediately relieved her pain; then, she took Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with pan fried Huangbo and Zhi Mu several times, and she did not experience a recurrence.</p>
<p>Another woman was very stout, suffering from a swollen and painful throat due to summer heat, with upper phlegm obstruction preventing her from speaking, putting her in a serious state. First, she used a needle to draw out toxic blood; then, with a golden key, she expelled thick phlegm in five or six bowls, after which a dose of Qingyan Lige Decoction slightly reduced the swelling and pain. After removing the salt and sulfide, she took more medication and stabilized.</p>
<p>A man was very fatigued, with a swollen and painful throat. He tried taking a throat-soothing decoction without effect. Upon examination, his pulse was thin and weak, indicating a deficiency due to overwork and false heat. In the morning, he took Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Mai Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Jie Geng, and Yuan Shen, and in the evening, he took Si Wu Decoction with Huangbo, Zhi Mu (fried black), and Gan Jiang, adding child&#39;s urine with the doses. Within a few days, the swelling and pain disappeared, and his fatigue alleviated, restoring his throat.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from increasing swelling and pain. He took throat-clearing and digestive medicines, but they did not help. He was determined to produce pus. To counteract this, I administered the Feng Tong Sheng San, reducing the use of both nitrate and yellow medicine. His throat was swollen and painful, but after acupuncture, he was cured.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue,&quot; it says: A friend of mine, Wang Pengque, was in his thirties and initially unrecognizable. He had a throat affliction for more than ten days. Upon my examination, I saw that his face and head were swollen, his throat and neck were extremely thick, he breathed heavily and his voice was hoarse, with swelling and mouth sores, causing him intense pain. A servant had been unable to lie down for several days. Upon checking his pulse, it was very thin and weak; when he spoke, his voice was faint. Inquiring about the medicines he had taken, they were all related to herbs like Scutellaria, Coptis, Gardenia, and Rhubarb. This was likely due to damage to the Yin, compounded by the invasion of cold, leading to excess cold at the lower part and blocking Yang at the top. Consequently, water and drink could hardly enter, and he was particularly fearful of heat. I said: &quot;This is serious! If we delay half a day more, it will be too late for treatment.&quot; So I prepared a cooling Yin decoction with cold water and let him drink it slowly. After consuming one decoction, he had a swollen and painful head and neck, but all symptoms disappeared by morning.</p>
<p>The next day, when I saw him again, he had lost weight and looked emaciated, unlike his previous bloated self. I then continued treatment with several doses of the Five Blessings drink and he gradually recovered. Those who doubted were initially shocked, but later, they were grateful to me for bringing him back from the brink, resulting in a deep bond of friendship.<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman in her thirties came to my home, suffering from exhaustion and pain in her throat due to a sore. She had seen many doctors without success. Upon examining her pulse, I found it rapid and weak; her symptoms indicated frequent loose stools. While asking about the treatments she had tried, she mentioned that they all involved clearing heat and removing fire. However, the more they cleared the fire, the worse her throat pain became. Upon careful observation, I realized that her issue was not due to excess heat and that she had been using too many cold and cooling remedies, which led to an empty feeling in her abdomen. Thus, I decided to specifically use nourishing herbal formulas like the Yin Replenishing Decoction and the Great Tonifying Yuan Decoction. In less than half a month, her throat pain reduced, and in less than six months, she was completely cured.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a></p></div>
