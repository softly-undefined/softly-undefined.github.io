<p>Huangdi’s Spiritual Pivot</p>
<p>Chapter on True and False Evils of Needle Insertion</p>
<p>When the external evils invade the body, they penetrate deeply. Cold and heat clash; if they linger too long and settle within, if cold triumphs over heat, it results in bone pain and withered flesh. If heat surpasses cold, it leads to decayed flesh and corrupted muscle, causing pus. Internal damage occurs to the bones, resulting in bone erosion. </p>
<p>If there is an ailment in a tendon, the tendon may bend and cannot extend. The evil qi resides therein, and does not revert, manifesting as a tendon knot. If there is a blockage, qi is directed towards it, and defensive qi remains, unable to revert. Fluids linger for an extended time, merging into intestinal knots, and over many years it may form. When pressed, it feels soft. </p>
<p>If a blockage is already present, with qi directed to it and fluids remaining, if evil qi penetrates it, the congestion will worsen over time, connecting and compounding into a former tumor, which feels hard to the touch. </p>
<p>If a blockage occurs deep within the bones, the qi derives from the bones; when the bones and qi are coupled, it will progressively enlarge, becoming a bone carbuncle. </p>
<p>If a blockage is in the flesh, the vital qi is directed towards it, with evil remaining and not departing. If there is heat, it transforms into pus; if there is no heat, it results in flesh carbuncle. </p>
<p>All of these types of qi manifest without a consistent external location but have fixed names such as withered flesh, bone erosion, tendon knots, and former tumors. </p>
<p>[Note: This text states that physical injury leads to sickness in qi, and injury to qi leads to sickness in the body. The blockages of qi are influenced by the clash of cold and heat, returning to the form where evils stagnate. These types of qi may arise from variable locations, but have defined names like withered flesh, bone erosion, tendon knots, and former tumors.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Comprehensive Treatise on Sores and Ulcers</strong> [Song Dynasty, Dou Hanqing]</p>
<p><strong>Various Tumors</strong></p>
<p>This condition is caused by influences within the six organs, flowing through the meridians. Wind, cold, dampness, and heat harm the heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys, leading to the accumulation of blood that does not disperse, gradually increasing in size. If there is any rupture, apply plum blossom powder to the area; for those that have formed a mass, first apply a topical medication to the center of the tumor, and after seven days, the malignant tissue may be removed. Afterwards, apply a medicinal plaster and internally treat with a secret recipe for dispelling qi. This should not be taken lightly.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>Sparrow Spots</h3>
<p>This condition originates from the lung meridian. It may occur when the mother, during conception, does not observe taboos, and due to drunkenness or exposure to wind in a room, she becomes susceptible to malefic energies. The lung is considered the cover of the five organs; therefore, lung wind manifests externally as sparrow spots. It is advisable to use a wind-dispelling herbal ointment for treatment.<br>— <em>Three Causes Prescription</em> [Song Dynasty, Chen Wuze]</p>
<hr>
<h3>Goiter</h3>
<p>Goiters are often located on the shoulders and neck, and they form due to the accumulation of Qi. These conditions typically develop over many years, gradually increasing in size and becoming hard and immovable, referred to as stone goiters. If the skin color does not change, it is termed a flesh goiter; if the veins protrude, it is again called a stone goiter; if there are red, intertwined veins, it is a blood goiter; and if it fluctuates with worries, it is known as a qi goiter. All five types of goiter should not be rashly incised; if ruptured, it can lead to pus and blood loss, often resulting in early death. There are six types of tumors: bone tumor, lipoma, gas tumor, flesh tumor, pus tumor, and blood tumor, which should also not be incised. The flesh tumor is particularly dangerous to cut; should it be treated in such a way, it may be fatal. Only the lipoma can be cut and, once the fatty tissue is removed, it can heal.<br>— <em>Ruminations on Filial Piety</em> [Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng]</p>
<hr>
<h3>Goiter</h3>
<p>Goiters are cysts that cause pressure. As Ji Shuye stated in his &quot;On Health Preservation&quot;: &quot;When the neck resembles a hazard due to goiter, it is due to water.&quot; One may use a ginseng goiter-dissolving pill to alleviate it. Additionally, three ingredients — kelp, seaweed, and kombu — all from the sea, if two of these are placed in a jar of water and consumed regularly, can also help in resolving the issue.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty - Zhu Zhenheng)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Goiter</strong>  </p>
<p>To treat goiter, one must first eliminate rich flavors.<br>A lump, whether located in the neck, arm, or body, often resembles an abscess. This is mostly due to damp phlegm accumulation, resulting in a lump that does not disperse.  </p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Cases</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Xue Ji)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Tumors</strong>  </p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the liver governs tendons and stores blood; the heart encapsulates blood and controls the vessels; the spleen governs flesh and regulates blood; the lungs dominate qi and manage the pores; the kidneys govern bones and manage water. If anger stirs the liver fire, causing blood depletion and muscle contraction, it may result in swelling of the tendons, which, upon palpation, feels like tendons and may eventually develop blood threads; this is called a tendon tumor, treated with Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill, Four Substance Decoction, and herbal remedies like gardenia and papaya. If anger stirs the liver fire, causing yin blood to boil and external pathogens to clash and swell, it may result in muscle swelling, eventually appearing red, and the skin may also appear red; this is termed a blood tumor, treated with Four Substance Decoction, Poria, and herbal remedies like polygala. If stagnation injures the spleen, leading to thin and wasted muscles, and external pathogens strike and cause swelling, causing soft swelling of the muscles upon palpation; this is called a flesh tumor, treated with Restore the Spleen and Tonify Qi Decoction. If labor injures lung qi, making the pores loose, and external pathogens clash and cause an obstruction and swelling, causing soft swelling of the skin upon palpation; this is called a qi tumor, treated with revitalizing remedies.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>If the kidneys&#39; water is damaged due to overstrain, causing the bones not to be nourished and resulting in swelling, and if the swelling originates from the bones and is hard to the touch, it is called a bone tumor. This can be treated with the Rehmannia Pill and the Renowned Qi-boosting Decoction. A tumor indicates stagnation, arising from injuries to the organs, leading to disharmony of qi and blood; thus, one should seek to treat the root cause. Generally, if it belongs to the liver and gallbladder meridians, the Eight Treasures Decoction with gardenia and gentian can be used to nourish qi and blood and clear liver fire. The Six Flavors Pill can nourish lung metal to generate kidney water. If it pertains to liver fire and blood dryness, one needs to cool and nourish the blood with the Four Substances, two types of Rehmannia, peony, wine-fried black gentian, and gardenia. For those with weakened central qi, the Renowned Qi-boosting Decoction should be taken in tandem. If treatment is not applied correctly, it may lead to spleen and stomach deficiency, weakened nutritive qi, and an inability to nourish the affected area; or if cold stagnates at the sore, the nourishing qi may fail to nourish the area, resulting in failure to regenerate muscle and leading to a chronic sore. In this case, one must adjust and tonify the spleen and stomach to strengthen qi and blood, allowing the muscles to regenerate naturally. If one becomes careless with diet, lifestyle, the six excesses, or the seven emotions, or uses cooling and corrosive medicines, such as applying spider silk or convolvulus, to treat the exterior, it is indeed a mistake.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Warts</strong></p>
<p>Warts belong to the category of wind-heat and blood dryness associated with the gallbladder and lesser yang channel. They may arise from liver anger causing fire, or from the pernicious influences of lust affecting the liver. The heat in the liver dries up its moisture, leading to insufficient kidney energy, which results in the depletion of essence and muscle spasms. It is advisable to use Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water, thereby generating liver blood. If one resorts to wrapping with spider silk, using mantis bites, or applying moxibustion, it will likely lead to many mistakes. Generally, this condition resembles the dryness and clumping of blood; therefore, external corrosive methods and internal consumption of drying blood and detoxifying substances will worsen the depletion of essence and blood. The liver&#39;s tendons will be injured, and the wound will bulge and open unexpectedly, leading to failure of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Nodular Goiter Warts (Disease Nine)</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, there are five types of goiter and six types of tumors, but Xue Lizhai only mentions five tumors. Essentially, goiters and tumors are one kind; both are formed by phlegm and qi clumping, differing only in size and their location on the neck and body. Lizhai states: the liver manages the tendons; when anger stirs the liver fire, blood becomes dry and the tendons contract, resulting in what is called a tendon tumor. The heart governs blood; when overexerted, fire stirs, yin fire boils, and external pathogens invade, causing swelling, termed a blood tumor. The spleen governs flesh; when it is blocked and injured, the flesh becomes thin, and when external pathogens strike, it results in swelling, termed a flesh tumor. The lungs govern qi; when exerted, original qi weakens, pores are loose, and external pathogens strike, leading to swelling, termed a qi tumor. The kidneys govern bones; when they are overworked, renal water cannot nourish the bones, resulting in swelling, termed a bone tumor. These are the five names for tumors.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>The Book of Ren Zhai states: When tendons and veins protrude, it is called tendon goiter; when red veins intertwine, it is called blood goiter; when the skin color does not change, it is called flesh goiter; when it grows and shrinks with worries and sorrows, it is called qi goiter; when it is hard and immovable, it is called stone goiter. These are the five names for goiter. Goiters correspond to the five internal organs, and their treatment with medicine is the same.</p>
<p>The reason why goiters have two names is that their shape resembles a cherry, with one side enlarged like a cherry, the skin sagging wide and not urgent. They are caused by worries and anger, hence they are also called qi goiter; what is now referred to as a shadow sack is this. Initially, the tumor appears like a plum or a peach, with tender and smooth skin, gradually resembling a pomegranate or gourd. This is due to the labor of the seven emotions and the influence of external pathogens leading to phlegm accumulation and stagnation of qi. Therefore, it is also called a tumor. In summary, these are all formed by the stagnation and congealing of qi and blood. Worries and anger deplete the heart and lungs, hence goiters are often found on the neck and shoulders. Labor and external pathogenic influences take advantage of the deficiency in the meridians, thus tumors can occur anywhere.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Tumors may be hard or soft, painless and itchless. For solid types, use Hai Zao San Jian Wan or Kelp Pill; for those with excess phlegm and heat, use Shi Zhang San or Shen Xiao Kai Jie San. These are all remedies to transform phlegm, regulate qi, and break down hardness, but should not be used recklessly in cases of prolonged deficiency. For deficiency types: use Jin Liu, Shen Qi Wan, or Ba Wu Decoction with added Gardenia, Papaya, and fried Black Gentian; for excess liver fire, occasionally take Aloe Vera Pills. For blood tumors, use Si Wu Decoction with Poria and Yuan Zhi. For flesh tumors, use Gui Pi Decoction or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. For bone tumors, use Shen Qi Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. General treatments: for early stages, use Shi Liu Wei Liu Qi Yin or Dan Zhizhu Fang; for those that have persisted, use Wax Alum Pill, taking it regularly to gradually reduce size. Externally, apply Nan Xing ointment, but absolutely avoid using needles or knives, as breaking it will lead to pus and blood bursting out, leaking uncontrollably, which could be fatal.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>There is a type of lipoma that is red and resembles phlegm; it can be cured by cutting it open with a sharp knife. Some, resembling a hanging eggplant with very small roots, should have their stems treated with medicine, and once the eggplant falls off, one should apply a wound healing medicine to prevent bleeding. </p>
<p>Warts commonly appear on the backs of the hands and between the fingers, varying in size from that of a yellow soybean to clustered grains, or like ripe mulberries. When pulled, they may leave strands several inches long; they are also called &quot;back of the hand growths.&quot;</p>
<p>For conditions caused by wind-heat, blood dryness, and muscle contraction, one should use Ba Wei Xiao Yao San with added Huang Lian, or Qing Gan Yi Rong Tang. If liver fire is provoked by anger, one should use Chai Hu Qing Gan Tang. For cases where essence is lost and the kidneys are withered, use Shen Qi Wan. Be cautious of improperly using cool or fire-reducing medicines, as well as methods like mantis bites, spider silk entanglement, Goryeo flower juice application, or moxa burning, as these can exacerbate mild cases and lead severe ones to result in major ulceration, swelling, pain, fever, hemorrhage, and death. </p>
<p>(Cancer Nine) Sores that appear like fish scales or spots are similar to thousand-day sores and often arise on the hands and feet; they are also called &quot;unlucky sores.&quot; It is advisable to apply moxibustion to the initial stage, as this will cause the remaining ones to fall off, yielding miraculous effects.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Tumors</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang】<br><strong>Methods of Treating Tumors</strong></p>
<p>For tumors, when Qi condenses within the skin, they suddenly swell, resembling plums and peaches, with soft and shiny skin, gradually forming shapes like cups or eggs. If they are soft and painless, they are blood tumors; if they gradually swell without significant heat and cause occasional pulling pain, they are Qi tumors. When Qi is slightly blocked and remains swollen for a long time, it may eventually turn to pus. All tumors and growths will self-resolve naturally with age. Treatment in young adults may prevent future concerns. If upon palpation they can be moved, one may consider removing them. If they cannot be moved, they should not be removed. Tumors come in all sizes, and one should not recklessly decide on removal without proper assessment, as this could endanger life. Common wisdom suggests that tumors should be left alone; they should not be lightly removed, which is not without reason.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Method of Treatment: First, apply iron pot salve to the top of the tumor, allowing the flesh to blacken and rot without pain, so that it can then be cut away. Additionally, apply medicine to cause the flesh to rot completely, making it ready for cutting. Alternate between applying and cutting until the root of the tumor is entirely removed. If one fears needles or knives, instead apply Jinjinsan to darken the flesh to an extreme degree and cause complete rotting before using knives or scrapers. If any flesh remains not fully blackened, it may not be dead; if the flesh is not dead, the blood is also alive, and if the blood is alive, it cannot be cut or scraped, as this may lead to excessive bleeding and cause fainting. Only when the flesh is entirely blackened and significantly rotted, to the point that it can be moved, is it truly dead. Once the flesh is dead, the blood is also dead, and the dead blood can be cut or scraped away without issue. Even when treating blood tumors or flesh tumors, it is permissible to remove them. Small tumors can be removed for immediate recovery. For large tumors, if there is muscle numbness for half a year, it is advisable to take tonic medicines to nourish the qi and blood, which will eventually lead to healing over time.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Goiter</strong></p>
<p>In humans, the condition of goiter arises not from the stagnation of Yin and Yang正气 (vital energy) but from the stasis of blood and the accumulation of turbid Qi and phlegm within the five internal organs. Goiter is associated with Yang, characterized by red color and protrusion, sometimes with a small stalk hanging down. A tumor, on the other hand, is associated with Yin, characterized by a white color and diffuse swelling, usually without itch or pain, unnoticeable to the person. Xue Lizhai provides a detailed distinction. The liver governs tendons; when anger provokes liver fire, causing dryness in the blood and spasms in the tendons, it is termed a tendon tumor; the heart governs blood; excessive suddenness can cause the fire to stir the blood to boil, additionally affected by external pathogens leading to swelling, referred to as a blood tumor; the spleen governs muscles; if there is stagnation harming the spleen, the muscles become thin and weak, with Earth Qi failing to circulate, resulting in swelling within the flesh, called a flesh tumor; the lungs govern Qi; overwork damages the original Qi, with pores not being tightly sealed, and external cold leading to swelling, termed a Qi tumor; the kidneys govern bones; excessive indulgence can harm the kidneys, causing kidney fire to be constrained, leading to insufficient nourishment of the bones, resulting in swelling referred to as a bone tumor.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>I say: A muscle tumor is firm and purple, with blue veins winding. In severe cases, it may knot like a earthworm. Treatment should clear the liver and relieve depression, nourish the blood and relax the muscles; this is achieved with the Aloe Vera Liver Clear Pill. A blood tumor is slightly purple, slightly red, with a mix of soft and hard; the skin is subtly entwined like red threads, and if scratched, it bleeds and cannot be contained. Treatment should nourish the blood and cool it, suppress heat and nourish yin, calm the mind, and harmonize the blood vessels; this is achieved with the Qinjian Ermu Pill. A flesh tumor is soft like cotton, high like a steamed bun, with unchanged skin color, neither tight nor loose, merely covering the liver all year round. Treatment should regulate the spleen and alleviate dampness, unblock the earth element, relieve depression and resolve phlegm, adjust diet; this is achieved with the Modified Return to Spleen Pill. A gas tumor is soft but not hard, the skin color remains the same, may shrink or grow, with no heat or cold present. Treatment should clear lung energy, regulate the meridians, treat fatigue, harmonize the protective and nourishing energies; this is achieved with the Gas Unblocking and Firming Pill.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>A bone tumor presents as purple-black in color, hard as stone, elevated like a lump, immobile upon pressure, firmly attached to the bone. The treatment should focus on replenishing kidney energy, nourishing blood, promoting circulation, dispersing swelling, breaking down hardness, and unblocking pathways; the formula for this is the Tiaoyuan Shenqi Pill. This describes the five types of tumors and their five treatment methods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, &quot;Lizhai&quot; states: when tendons and bones are exposed, it is called muscle goiter; tangled red veins are called blood goiter; unchanged skin color indicates flesh goiter; growth influenced by emotional states is termed qi goiter; and one that is hard and immovable is referred to as stone goiter. These are the five names of goiter.</p>
<p>General treatment: for newly emerged tumors with sufficient vital energy, use Hai Zao Yu Hu Decoction or Liu Jun Wan. If the vital energy has been depleted over time, choose Hu Po Hei Long Dan or Shi Quan Liu Qi Decoction. Taking these medicines will gradually reduce and dissolve the tumor. It is crucial not to lightly resort to needles or knives, as doing so may cause continuous bleeding and significant danger. Over time, this could lead to the tumor rupturing and persistent leakage, ultimately resulting in harm to the person.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>There is another type of lesion, pink in color, often growing in front of and behind the ears; some also appear on the lower body. These are formed from the condensation of phlegm and qi, and it is advisable to use a beryllium needle to puncture and remove the fatty powder. By inserting a three-pronged needle several times, the inner membrane can be cleansed, allowing it to heal on its own. </p>
<p>Another type is the black sand lump, commonly found on the arms and legs, varying in size and, when lifted by hand, reveals black within. This should also be treated with needle puncture to expel the black sand with sound, varying in softness and hardness. </p>
<p>There is also a hair lump, often growing just below the ears, soft, small, and raised slightly, which does not cause pain upon pressing. This should likewise be treated with a needle to expel the hair. </p>
<p>Additionally, there is a type of lump related to roundworms, which occurs under the ribs. There is also a type of ulcerative lump that connects to the shoulders and hips, discussed later in treatment experiences. </p>
<p>From my observation of ancient texts, there is also a type known as wind lump, but its form varies. All of these conditions are due to the damp heat of the five organs, along with evil fire, turbid qi, and stagnant blood, suggesting they are not true diseases. The ones mentioned above have all been personally treated and verified, so they are not erroneous.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>At the onset, a red glow, slightly warm and painful, with a superficial and unstable root indicates ease. When it has developed, a red and swollen mass, causing intense heat and pain, with skin broken open and pus discharging indicates ease. Once it has ruptured, with thick and bright pus, roots diminishing, internal flesh gradually growing, and external skin tightening indicates progress. After rupture, if the energy is calm, diet continues as usual, swelling reduces and pain ceases, with the mouth tightly closing indicates progress. At the onset, if the flesh color remains unchanged, with gradual onset of cold and heat, failed roots, and intermittent pain indicates danger. When fully developed, if it becomes as hard as stone, with restricted movement, cough, phlegm, cold skin, and poor appetite indicates reversal. If ruptured without pus, only blood and water flowing, swelling unrelenting, pain constant, and spleen energy weak indicates reversal. After rupture, if bleeding continues, swelling increases, rotten matter does not detach, with foul breath and nausea indicates death. </p>
<p>Treatment methods.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Initially, without evidence of internal or external manifestations, formations should promote the circulation of energy and disperse blood. Once formed, if there is no pain or itching, whether soft or hard, a white color indicates phlegm accumulation; therefore, one should move phlegm and smooth energy. When an existing formation is red, hard, gradually enlarging, and slightly itchy or painful, it is necessary to tonify kidney energy and activate blood to dissolve hardness. If it resembles a stem of eggplant and is large and drooping, one should apply medicine to its base; when the eggplant falls, it will promote tissue growth and contraction. If there is persistent purulent discharge and the formation doesn’t diminish, one should primarily strengthen the spleen and stomach, assisted by methods to resolve hardness. In cases of rupture with infrequent bleeding and an open, oozing formation, it is advisable to nourish and cool the blood, assisted by methods to clear the liver. After rupture, if the swelling gradually decreases but the spleen remains weak and cannot contract, one should tonify kidney energy and assist the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>Freckles are due to kidney water not nourishing the upper body and phlegm-fire stagnating to form spots. One should use the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to nourish the source of transformation and externally apply the Jade Contour Pill to wash and gradually heal in the morning and evening. For women with dark spots, the deficiency of water cannot control fire, and weak blood cannot nourish flesh, leading to dry fire accumulating into black spots, with a withered color lacking luster. Taking the Kidney Energy Pill in the morning and using the Jade Contour Pill to wash the spots in the morning and evening will gradually diminish them over time; they should also avoid worry and labor which may inflame energy. However, if these arise from the husband, it indicates adversity, and uncertainties may often be present.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Withered Tendon Arrow</strong></p>
<p>Due to sorrow, the liver suffers, lacking nourishment, leading to the external emergence of tendon energy. Initially, it appears the size of a red bean with slight elevation. Over time, it ruptures, pushing out the tendon head, becoming loose and dry, often forming between the chest and breasts. It is advised to use fine medicinal thread to tie at the root tightly. After seven days, the condition will naturally fall off; mixing in pearl powder will help the scar heal. Additionally, one should avoid strong flavors, as they may exacerbate the condition.</p>
<p><strong>Black Spots</strong></p>
<p>Black spots, also known as moles, result from stagnation of turbid qi in the kidneys, with yang qi constricted, forming hard and persistent black spots. Anyone developing these will ultimately face misfortune. For those with facial moles, it is best to remove them using a fine copper tube to ensnare the mole, twisting six or seven times to draw the mole into the tube, and then quickly pull it out. If some cannot be pulled out due to being shallow, use a needle to puncture, apply a small amount of ice powder on the mole, and cover it with paper; it will naturally fall off in three days. Alternatively, applying rice ash paste can also work. After it has fallen off, use pearl powder to help the new skin heal. Avoid soy sauce and vinegar, which can cause pigmentation.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Moles</strong></p>
<p>Blood moles arise from the accumulation of angry fire in the liver meridian. Initially, they appear red like moles, then gradually grow to the size of beans, bleeding upon rubbing. To treat blood moles, apply peach blossom powder mixed with cool water, or use gold ink for topical application to stop the bleeding. Blood moles require the use of ice powder to dry out the original mole; after this, apply pearl powder for healing the new skin. In severe cases, internally consume cooling blood rehmannia decoction and also avoid strong flavors to begin recovery.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Complete Works of Jingyue</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty – Zhang Jieben</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tumors and Growths</strong></p>
<p>According to the evidence regarding tumors and growths, as previously discussed by Xue Ji, the details have been thoroughly addressed. However, among the five types of tumors, the powdery tumor is the most common. This occurs when the pores and channels are blocked, causing condensation that does not disperse, gradually forming a tumor; it is also a type of acne, differing only in depth. The deeper ones are beneath the skin and gradually enlarge into tumors. I have heard from my predecessors that larger tumors are most feared for their potential to rupture; unless they contain pus, they should not be opened. If opened, they may involve surrounding channels, causing leakage of blood and qi, leading to difficult recovery, with no one surviving. This has been confirmed by detailed investigations into several cases recorded by Xue—those that ruptured were all untreatable, indeed a truth that must be recognized.</p>
<p>The method of tying with spider silk can treat smaller tumors effectively, and this technique is quite remarkable. I once saw a person with a tumor on the abdomen, as large as a walnut; a practitioner took spider silk and twisted it into a thick thread, wrapping it around the base. After a few days, the silk gradually tightened and the base became thinner. After repeated adjustments, it eventually fell off within days; it truly is a wondrous method. One can see that while the threads relax over time, the spider silk tightens, demonstrating the principles of nature. However, it is also important to apply this method early; if the condition becomes too large, it may no longer be suitable.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>The Secret Techniques of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Different Treatments for Goiters</strong></p>
<p>Goiters vary in type: a goiter (瘿) grows connected to the flesh, with a large root and large body; while a tumor (瘤) has a small root but a large body. Within tumors, there are further distinctions: there are powder tumors, flesh tumors, sinew tumors, and substance tumors. Sinew tumors cannot be treated and do not need treatment, as they will only grow to the size of a walnut over a lifetime of ten years. Powder tumors will naturally expel powder resembling incense ash after three years and will heal on their own, requiring no treatment. Flesh tumors are the easiest to treat; use one qian of mercury and borax, three qian each of daemonorops, dragon&#39;s blood, three fen of borneol and musk, and five qian of huangbai, all ground into a fine powder. Apply this medicine to the root of the tumor, and it will fall away as you apply it. For those with small roots, none will remain. Substance tumors, however, with large roots, are the most difficult to treat. They may occasionally move and make sounds, resembling insect chirps or bird calls. It is essential to use a knife to open a hole, allowing the substance to escape; this will ensure it cannot remain and will create an outlet. Afterward, use a wound-healing miraculous medicine to dress the area, and the tumor will dissolve into water, returning to its normal state.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>This behavior shows disrespect to the spirits and offends the God of the Year, leading to an illness that cannot be measured or discussed through reason; therefore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; does not mention it. However, this illness has never been absent from the world. For treatment, use a mixture of myrrh and frankincense to remove oil, with one qian each of elephant skin, sandalwood powder, and ginseng; three qian of Panax notoginseng (Sanqi) root powder, and three qian of millennium lime; five fen of talcum powder; two qian each of Kirin blood extract and catechu; and three fen of borneol, ground into extremely fine powder, ground quietly as measured.</p>
<p>The treatment must be done on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, and no one else should see it. The tumors vary in form, but they are all caused by damp-heat. They grow from small to large, from large to rupture, and ultimately lead to death. At the onset, it is advisable to use a small knife to cut and slightly release white fluid, then apply the skin-regenerating powder for immediate healing. If treatment is neglected and the condition worsens, use a little medicine to apply to the depressed area; if it causes pain within half a day, fluid will be sure to emerge, and if it is white, recovery is easy; if it is yellow or red, recovery is difficult. However, taking this medicine will ensure healing.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>To prepare the medicine, use 1 qian each of mercury, borax, light powder, eagle droppings, magpie droppings, green vitriol, and soap alum, along with 5 fen each of borneol and ice flakes, and 3 fen of musk, grind them into an extremely fine powder. Use a needle to prick a small hole, then, while it is bleeding, apply the medicine to cause adhesion. Approximately 1 fen is to be mixed with human milk for application, the size of a chicken egg, applied three times a day. By the second day, there will certainly be a flow; during the flow, do not apply the medicine, for if it causes excessive pain, closure will be difficult. After three days, the flow will certainly cease and the skin will be as loose as a pouch. Then, use the following decoction to naturally restore it: 3 qian each of ginseng and yam, 5 qian each of poria and white peony, 1 liang each of coix and astragalus, 2 qian of alisma, and 1 qian each of polyporus, raw licorice, and dried tangerine peel. Boil with water to take, ten doses will completely restore it to normal. However, avoid sexual activity for a month; there are no other restrictions. If you engage in sexual activity, it will definitely break and will not close, becoming a lifelong leak.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If a person has a sickness where a sore develops on the arm, growing to the size of a fist, it must be cut away with a knife; otherwise, the person will suffer greatly and should not attempt this. I have an extraordinary remedy that only requires a small knife to slightly remove a layer of skin, after which a powdered medicine is applied to it, and it will dissolve into water—this is a miraculous method. The formula includes three qian of ginseng, one qian of licorice, one fen each of borax and borneol, and half a fen of light powder, which are all ground into a powder and mixed together; this will cause it to dissolve into water. This remedy is indeed a remarkable antidote and should not be underestimated. </p>
<p>Moreover, if someone has a sore on the abdomen that forms a stubborn lump and does not go away for a year, the same method can be applied for immediate results. If a person has a tumor on their foot the size of a dou (a unit of measure), it need not be ruptured; simply use a needle to lightly prick a small hole and apply the previous medicine, causing fluid to flow continuously. A decoction must also be used. The formula consists of three liang each of ginseng and astragalus, five liang each of fresh licorice and coix seeds, and three qian of white mustard seeds, all boiled in water. Two doses will completely eliminate the fluid without the person appearing weary; this is a method of treating both internally and externally. </p>
<p>The essence of this formula lies in replenishing the source of vital energy and enhancing fluid movement without losing the energy. By pricking a hole to release the fluid, it may result in significant depletion of the vital energy; hence, replenishing the energy eliminates any fear of fluid excessively exiting.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>Fang</p>

<p>The &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: The hand sun meridian diverges at a point called Zhi Zheng, located five inches above the wrist. When deficient, warts arise, small ones resembling finger scabs. This divergence defines where to treat. The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: For cold and heat causing neck swelling, when full it indicates elbow constriction, leading to headache and delirium; when deficient, it results in warts and small scabs, treated at Zhi Zheng. Enlargements like goiters, referred to as Tian Kwang (or Tian Rong), are treated at the joint. Goiters or nodules caused by Qi stagnation are treated at the corresponding meridian.</p>
<p>The &quot;Qian Jin Fang&quot; states: For goiters, caused by harmful Qi, moxibustion is to be applied at Tian Fu fifty times. Goiters accompanied by shortness of breath require moxibustion at Lung Shu a hundred times. Goiters causing chest fullness should receive moxibustion at Yun Men fifty times. For goiters related to fatigue, apply moxibustion at Chong Yang annually. In cases of face swelling due to goiters, moxibustion at Tong Tian fifty times is advised. </p>
<p>Goiters should be treated with moxibustion at Tian Liao three hundred times, horizontally one inch apart; additionally, moxibustion at Zhong Feng should be done annually, specifically at the inner curves beneath both feet. For all goiters, perform moxibustion at Jian Yu on both sides equivalently; for men, eighteen times on the left side and seventeen times on the right; for women, seventeen times on the left side and eighteen times on the right. Repeat several times until recovery is noted. </p>
<p>Additionally, apply moxibustion at Feng Chi a hundred times on both sides of the neck.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>Another method: Moxibustion at the hairline behind both ears with a hundred dosages.<br>Another method: Moxibustion at the head’s vertex (or neck); stretch both arms straight forward and perform moxibustion where the arms touch the head, directed towards the nose, with dosages corresponding to one&#39;s age and strength.  </p>

<p>Medical Case:<br>The &quot;Ru Men Shi Qin&quot; states: A woman from Xinzai, aged over forty, had a three-lobed goiter. She was instructed to induce vomiting with salt, which resulted in three expulsions, three sweats, and three bowel movements; her goiter was significantly reduced. Subsequently, she took medication to dissolve the goiter, leading to complete resolution. All ailments located above are suitable for purging; there are methods to gauge this as well.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>In Xi Hua, a healer was met with scorn from the crowd who believed he was merely vomiting. One day, Wei Shouzhi accompanied the healer to a food establishment, where they encountered a man suffering from a tumor located at the corner of his eye. It appeared gray and hung down over his vision, preventing him from seeing. The healer said to Shouzhi, &quot;I won&#39;t wait for the food to cook; I will remove this tumor immediately.&quot; Wei was skeptical. The healer then proposed, &quot;What if I take this tumor out for you?&quot; The man replied that others had been too afraid to cut it. The healer insisted, &quot;I won&#39;t use a knife; I have another technique.&quot; The man agreed and was led to a small room where he was instructed to lie supine on a bed, with his leg tied down. The healer then punctured the tumor, causing a significant amount of blood to flow. First, he massaged the man&#39;s eye; the tumor then expelled a clump of dark matter, and it was removed entirely. Shouzhi was astonished. The healer remarked, &quot;Is it possible that a person with skill can be observed fully?&quot;</p>
<p>In Gao City, which is the healer&#39;s hometown, there was an unmarried woman, eighteen years old, with tumors on both her hands that resembled chicken claws and ram&#39;s horns. Her wrists could not bend, and in the light of day, they appeared like peach gum. Her prospective husband&#39;s family wanted to abandon her, but the healer took a look and said, &quot;The tumor on her hand is a gel tumor, and the one on her face is a powder tumor. This is a gel tumor.&quot; He used a specialized needle to break it open and squeezed out three spoonfuls of yellow gel-like pus, after which the tumor flattened and would not reappear. The marriage was back on. Only those lacking understanding would refrain from using this method.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; states: In the spring of the Xin Chou year, Wang Tianjue of Changzhou suffered from a tumor on his left leg, shaped like a large peach, soft to the touch. He diligently took medicine to eliminate dampness, promote qi, and transform phlegm. He experienced chills, fever, decreased appetite, fatigue, and overall weakness; his pulse was robust yet vacuous, indicating a qi tumor associated with the lungs. Since the gallbladder relates to wood and the lungs to metal, the condition arose in the gallbladder meridian, where lung metal overcomes liver wood, leading to a depletion of original qi, and the pus had already festered internally.</p>
<p>He subsequently took several doses of the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction, which expelled a considerable amount of clear, thin pus. However, his condition worsened, manifesting as chills and fever, intense thirst, and headache, resembling a typhoid state. I surmised that this was due to the pus draining out, further depleting his blood and qi. He continued taking the previous decoction, but his condition exacerbated with a pulse that was large and rapid, feeling as though there was nothing there. Thus, I added one qian of Fuzi (Aconite) to the prescription, yet the situation worsened and the pulse returned to its prior state, indicating an extreme deficiency beyond the medicine’s reach. I then increased the Fuzi to two qian, and after three doses, the symptoms diminished significantly.</p>
<p>In the morning, he took the Qi-tonifying Decoction, and in the evening, he took the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction, each more than thirty doses, resulting in the expulsion of five pieces of necrotic bone, and the wound was nearly healed. Later, due to negligence in daily activities, the affected area festered again, and symptoms intensified. He experienced a burning sensation in his throat and had no skin on his lips and tongue. I prescribed the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction with an addition of one qian of Fuzi, and all symptoms resolved. However, after two days without medication, the internal issues returned along with the festering.</p>
<p>Two years later, he suffered again, and the previous medication was ineffective. Upon examining his pulse, it was thin like a silk thread, indicating that the Mingmen fire had weakened. I prescribed the Eight Flavor Pill as the principal treatment, assisted by the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction, which resulted in slight improvement. By the Yi Si year, he still suffered from symptoms of deficiency and cold, eventually passing away.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>A man had a swelling on the outer side of his left thigh near the hip, with a red thread for three years. His diet and daily activities were normal, but when it ruptured, blood and pus flowed out, causing fever and chills. This was a condition of the gallbladder meridian, hence it appeared on the outer side of the leg. Upon diagnosing his pulse, it was found to be forceful and rapid on the left wrist, and string-like and forceful on the right. This indicated that the kidney&#39;s water could not nourish the liver&#39;s wood. He was treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang (Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction) and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (Six-Ingredient Pill with Rehmannia), resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A man had a tumor in his abdomen, leaking pus and water. This indicated a condition of the three yin meridians. He was treated with an enhanced Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Mai Men Dong (Ophiopogon), and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandra) to strengthen the spleen&#39;s earth, along with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to generate kidney water. Additionally, Aloe Vera pills were used to clear liver fire and consolidate.</p>
<p>An elder scholar had a tumor between his eyebrows for two years, resembling a purple peach, hanging down over his eyes. When pressed, it felt like a water sac, indicating a condition of the liver and spleen, with internal pus and blood stasis. They proceeded to puncture it, releasing blood and pus, which immediately alleviated his vision. He was treated with ingredients such as fried black gallbladder herb, gardenia, ligusticum, angelica, peony, bupleurum, white atractylodes, and poria, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>In Jia Shan, a person named Zhou had a swelling between the ears and under the jaw, with hardened and congested muscles, coughing, and shortness of breath. They experienced internal heat and night sweats. The treatments they took were all aimed at resolving phlegm, dispersing hardness, and promoting the flow of energy, but their condition worsened. Upon examination, I found the left pulse weak and the left wrist pulse rapid, indicating that anger had harmed the liver and excessive work had damaged the kidneys. I advised nourishing kidney water and generating liver blood, and to be careful in regulating their activities. When water was abundant, it might lead to recovery. However, wanting quick results, they applied external medicinal pastes of herbs like smartweed and lime, and took internal remedies like seaweed and aconite. By autumn, as the elemental metal flourished, their vitality diminished further, leading to a worse swelling and eventual death.</p>
<p>In Zhenjiang, a person named Sun had a swelling between the legs resembling an overturned bowl, hard in texture and red in color, with internal heat and evening fevers, accompanied by spontaneous sweating and night sweats. They sought my treatment, stating that their ailment was being treated with remedies aimed at dispelling hardness, promoting energy flow, and reducing fire, but this only exacerbated their condition. Their left wrist pulse was rapid but weak, and the left pulse was rapid as well and hard upon pressure. This indicated that anger had harmed the liver, leading to blood depletion and muscle contraction. Due to their urgency for career advancement, I declined to treat them. They did not believe my warning and ultimately passed away. If this condition were treated by tonifying the spleen and lungs and nourishing the liver and kidneys, the wood would receive water and flourish, muscles would receive blood and moisten, leading to many surviving.</p>
<p>A student named Zhu Hongren, aged twenty, had five warts on each hand, with one large wart the size of a soybean, while the others resembled clusters of millet, pulling them off like silk and measuring about three or four inches in length. This indicated dried blood and contracted muscles. After treating with Qinggan Yirong Decoction for over fifty doses, he recovered completely.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>In the government school, Shen Jiwen, as a child, used to bite her nails and, upon growing up, could not control it. I said: This is due to excess liver fire and blood dryness. Additionally, she often had small warts on the side of her neck that would repeatedly break out and then disappear; she also had a spot on her arm the size of a mung bean that seemed to break like fragile thread: if tugged, it would grow; if relaxed, it would shrink. Later, the hair at her temples turned white, and she sought treatment. I said: You have had liver issues; this region is also related to the liver and gallbladder channels. Nails are residues of tendons, and the gallbladder runs along the side of the body, which corresponds to the complaints of biting nails and warts; you need to nourish the kidney water to support the liver and gallbladder, and then all illnesses will heal. Thus, I gave her the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. After two years, the white spots receded, and the warts no longer appeared.</p>
<p>One man had warts on his face that initially looked like red berries; after applying various ointments, they grew larger like fungi. Then he used caustics, and they expanded like tumors. This presented a complete deficiency of the three yin channels. I treated him with tonics for the spleen and lungs to nourish the liver and kidneys, and he soon recovered.</p>
<p>Another man had a spot in his lower abdomen that occasionally caused sharp pain. He tried using medications to move qi and dissolve phlegm, but they had no effect. He thought it might be related to blood clots and took qi-moving and blood-dispelling medicines. Later, a lump formed on the back of his hand that gradually grew to about an inch in size, resembling a turtle, with many small lumps appearing around his joints like mung beans. The mud turtle gives birth outward and requires blood-moving treatments. He had signs of deficiency, and his left wrist pulse was large, rapid, and string-like. I determined that the deficiency of kidney water was unable to nourish the liver wood, resulting in excess liver fire and muscle spasms. I prescribed the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to generate kidney water and nourish liver blood, and after a little more than three months, all his symptoms had improved.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>A man suffered from excessive labor, his complexion dark and sallow, experiencing fever and cough, with sores on his face and a lump in his abdomen, causing pain and dryness in his mouth, along with difficulty urinating. Taking medicines to resolve these issues only made his condition worse. Upon examining his pulse, it was found to be tight and forceful at both guan positions, indicating very weak vital energy, suggesting the liver and spleen were affected and the muscles were in spasm. He was given a modified Xiao Yao San combined with Di Huang Wan, which restored his vital energy. If he had mistakenly taken medications for blood stasis, his ailment would definitely have worsened.</p>
<p>Another man, who regularly consumed rich foods and strong liquor, initially experienced bloody stools and constipation, anxiety, and insomnia. Later, small lumps like warts appeared around his anal area, varying in size. After using medicines to clear heat and detoxify for six months, similar lumps appeared in his thighs. He used phlegm-relieving medicines, experiencing phlegm issues accompanied by cold and heat, and upon examining his liver and kidney pulses, they were fast and weak. I believed this was due to deficiency of blood and excess heat in the three yin meridians, and the method should nourish the source. He was skeptical and took Four Substance Decoction, Huang Lian, and Zhi Mu, leading to a resurgence of all symptoms, which damaged his stomach qi and affected all meridians. I first prescribed over thirty doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and the symptoms gradually improved. He then took the same decoction in the morning and Ba Zhen Tang in the evening for over fifty doses, and the symptoms soon resolved. Eventually, in the evening, I changed to Liu Wei Wan combined with Wu Wei Zi, and after half a year, all symptoms were completely healed.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>A woman had multiple lesions on the back of her left hand and fingers, resembling ripe mulberries. She experienced internal heat and discomfort, with menstrual periods irregular and absent. I said this was due to deficiencies in the liver and spleen leading to heat. She should balance and nourish both channels, allowing the yin blood to grow, and then the symptoms would resolve on their own. Doubting this, she applied moxibustion, which caused swelling and heat in her hand, cramps in her fingers, and warts on her flanks, neck, and between her breasts, with menstruation still absent. I prescribed a modified version of Xiao Yao San with an added few doses of fried black Huang Lian, and she gradually improved. Then I removed Huang Lian and supplemented with Gui Pi Decoction, and her condition gradually got better. After about a hundred doses, her menstruation returned regularly. She then took three doses of Di Huang Wan and was cured.</p>
<p>Another woman had a mass in her lower abdomen, alternately causing upward pressure or downward heaviness, with chills and fever, chest tightness, and dribbling urination. I prescribed remedies to move qi and resolve phlegm, but these exacerbated her previous symptoms, resulting in over two months without menstruation. Some suspected there was a growth inside, and advised drinking its blood, leading her to take expelling remedies that caused significant blood loss. She had a wart on the back of each hand, each about the size of a large soybean, which grew to about an inch after two months, and she developed several more warts. Suspecting that the growths were linked to the external condition, I continued with the expelling treatments. She also developed swelling beneath both ears, suspected to be due to toxic sores. I concluded this was due to liver fire and blood dryness. I prescribed a combination of modified Xiao Yao and Gui Pi Decoction along with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, and after more than three months, she was cured.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>A woman suffered from warts and used spider silk, Euphorbia, mantis bites, corrosive poison, and moxibustion, resulting in severe swelling and pain, fever, and bleeding.

<p>According to &quot;The Authentic Text of External Medicine&quot;: A man had a tumor on his buttocks for five years, shaped like a covered gourd, which appeared dark when pressed. This was a black powder tumor. It was pierced with a needle, and dark sand and black powder were pressed out, amounting to about a bowl. A three-type needle was inserted into the affected area for over ten days, pressing out a black membrane each time, and the tumor gradually shrank. He also took a tonic soup to strengthen the spleen and stomach and nourish Qi and blood, and after a month, it healed.</p>
<p>A man developed a tumor on his cheek for six months, shaped like a covered peach, with unchanged skin color, which turned slightly red when pressed. This was a powder tumor. It was pierced with a needle to remove the fatty powder, and a front medication was inserted. It healed in half a month.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>A soldier from Yiwu had five small tumors growing under his shoulder. After more than three months, they began to itch and felt unusual. When he touched them, he could feel something moving inside. Upon examination, it indeed felt like shrimp. Therefore, it was certain that there was an unusual insect inside. I used a needle to pierce one of the tumors, and initially, a spoonful of red fluid came out, followed shortly by a black-tipped pink worm, which was unchanged. The patient gradually felt weak, which was a consequence of the fluid loss. I stopped the tumor&#39;s growth, treated him with several doses of a tonic to replenish energy, and covered the area with an ointment. After five or six days, the patient felt better and gradually resumed breaking it down. I continued with a tonic of over ten doses until he recovered.</p>
<p>A woman and a girl each had a tumor about an inch below their hairline behind the ear, which had grown gradually for more than half a year. This was a fatty tumor. I used a needle to break it, and initially, fatty powder came out, followed by several strands of hair, each about two feet long, which I cut off at the roots. A little blood was lost, and I applied some medicine. Within several days, the inner membrane dissolved and they recovered. From this, it is evident that tumors can develop from hair.</p>
<p>Another woman had a flesh tumor on her waist for over three years, which had begun to ache slightly. One day, it burst, releasing three small roundworms about five inches long, which swam in warm water before stopping after a while. At that time, the patient looked weak, her face pale and thin, dry mouth and feverish. In the morning, she took Eight-Flavored Pills, and in the afternoon, Ginseng Nourishing Decoction. After taking it for about a hundred days, her vitality gradually revived; another hundred days passed before her mouth closed. I assessed that the worms were transformed from the energy and blood within the meridians.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>A woman developed a tumor on her body, red and purple, firm to the touch, which was identified as a blood tumor. Upon examination, both the heart and liver pulses were found to be strong and rapid, indicating that her condition was due to stagnation of heart energy and injury to liver energy. Treatment was deemed impossible. Later, she sought medical treatment in the capital, by which time the tumor had begun to ulcerate. Despite attempts to strengthen and cool her blood with various remedies, the ulcer worsened day by day, and ultimately, she did not respond to any further treatment. After two months of deterioration, a sudden gush of purple blood erupted, and she soon passed away. When later asked what caused this, I replied: the heart pulse was strong and rapid, indicating excess heart fire; the liver pulse was wiry and rapid, indicating liver injury. Excess heat forced the blood to flow erratically, while injured liver energy could not contain the blood, leading to uncontrolled bleeding when the tumor ruptured, often resulting in death. It was this reasoning that led me to advise against treatment.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue,&quot; I noted that beyond three weeks, I suddenly felt a small lump beneath my buttocks, in front of the anus, beneath the skin near the bone, initially no larger than a mung bean. I paid it no mind, but after six months, it grew to the size of a yellow bean, and after another year, it resembled a soap nut, then grew to the size of a chestnut. At this point, sitting on a horse or in a chair became uncomfortable, and it gradually became painful. I recognized that this couldn’t be resolved with external ointments or herbal decoctions. If it continued to grow, it would reach the size of a compartment and hang between my waist and hips, severely limiting movement, which could potentially render me immobile. This caused me deep concern. Advisers warned against surgery, fearing significant complications. After contemplating for several months, I found no one who dared to act impulsively.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>I have secretly calculated that if I do not take action against this small issue now, it will only grow larger and harder to deal with in the future. What can be done about it? I have seen people who have been injured by arrows between their buttocks; they do not necessarily die from it. The pros and cons of this situation are somewhat similar, so I resolved to remove it. One day, feeling slightly tipsy from drinking, I took a willow needle and pierced it. What came out resembled the white skin of tofu, indeed, it was a small tumor. After piercing, it immediately shrank, and I felt quite pleased. However, two days later, it swelled like a hot abscess. I applied a medicated ointment, and after three days, it ruptured and healed, leaving me satisfied once more. </p>
<p>Yet, within two days it swelled again, hotter and larger, and I was filled with great fear and regret, believing that tumors should not be pierced. Nevertheless, I had no choice but to apply the medicated ointment again, and after another three days, it burst open, releasing something resembling a fish bladder, after which it closed up and fully healed. </p>
<p>Now, many years later, there remains a small pore, which is indeed a dangerous reminder. Had it not been for my decisive courage, I cannot imagine what might have happened later; had I delayed the procedure, it could have turned truly unmanageable. Thus, if a disease is not treated early, one cannot foresee the outcome; this serves as a lesson for those who treat illnesses.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　虚邪之入于身也深，寒与热相搏，久留而内着，寒胜其热则骨疼肉枯，热胜其寒则烂肉腐肌为脓，内伤骨，内伤骨为骨蚀。有所疾前筋，筋屈不能伸，邪气居其间而不反，发为筋溜。有所结，气归之，卫气留之，不得反，津液久留，合而为肠溜，久者数岁乃成，以手按之柔。已有所结，气归之，津液留之，邪气中之，凝结日以易甚，连以聚居为昔瘤，以手按之坚。有所结，深中骨，气因于骨，骨与气并，日以益大，则为骨疽。有所结，中于肉，宗气归之，邪留而不去，有热则化而为脓，无热则为肉疽。凡此数气者，其发无常处而有常名也。　　【注　此言形伤则病气，气伤则病形也。结气归之者，寒热相博之气，归于邪留之形所也。凡此数气，发无定处，而有肉枯、骨蚀、筋溜、昔瘤之定名。】<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>　　　　疮疡全书 【宋　窦汉卿】</p>

<p>　　瘿多着于肩项，瘤则随气凝结。此等皆年数深远，寖大寖长，坚硬不可移者名曰石瘿，皮色不变者名曰肉瘿，筋脉露结者名曰石瘿，赤脉交结者名曰血瘿，随忧愁消长者名曰气瘿。五瘿皆不可妄决，破则脓血崩溃，多致夭枉。瘤则有六，骨瘤、脂瘤、气瘤、肉瘤、脓瘤、血瘤，名不可决溃。肉瘤尤不可决，治则杀人。惟脂瘤破而去其脂粉则愈。<br>　　　　儒门事亲 【元　张从政】</p>

<p>　　《内经》云：肝统筋而藏血，心裹血而主脉，脾主肉而统血，肺主气而司腠理，肾统骨而主水。若怒动肝火，血涸而筋挛者，其自筋肿起，按之如筋，久而或有血缕，名曰筋瘤，用六味地黄丸、四物、山栀、木瓜之类。若怒动肝火，阴血沸腾，外邪相搏而为肿者，其自肌肉肿起，久而有赤缕，或皮俱赤，名曰血瘤，用四物、茯苓、远志之类。若郁结伤脾，肌肉消薄，外邪所搏而为肿者，其自肌肉肿起，按之实软，名曰肉瘤，用归脾、益气二汤。若劳伤肺气，腠理不密，外邪所搏而壅肿者，其自皮肤肿起，按之浮软，名曰气瘤，用补中益气之类。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>若劳伤肾水，不能荣骨而为肿者，其自骨肿起，按之坚硬，名曰骨瘤，用地黄丸及补中益气汤主之。夫瘤者留也，随气凝滞，皆因脏腑受伤，气血乖逢，当求其属而治其本。大凡属肝胆二经结核，八珍加山栀、胆草以养气血清肝火，六味丸以养肺金生肾水。若属肝火血燥，须生血凉血，用四物、二地、丹皮、酒炒黑胆草、山栀。中气虚者，补中益气兼服。若治失其法，脾胃亏损，营气虚弱，不能濡于患处；或寒气凝于疮口，荣气不能滋养于患处，以致久不生肌而成漏者，悉调补脾胃，则气血壮而肌肉自生矣。若不慎饮食起居，及六淫七情，或用寒凉蚀药、蛛丝缠芫花线等法以治其外，则误矣。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　　疣</p>
<p>　　疣属肝胆少阳经风热血燥，或怒动肝火，或肝客淫气所致。盖肝热水涸，肾气不荣，故精亡而筋挛也，宜以地黄丸滋肾水以生肝血为善。若用蛛丝缠、螳螂蚀、着艾灸，必多致误。大抵此证与血燥结核相同，故外用腐蚀等法，内服燥血消毒，则精血愈虚，肝筋受伤，疮口翻突开张，卒成败证。<br>　　　　医学入门 【明　李梴】</p>

<p>　　旧分五瘿六瘤，惟薛立斋止言五瘤。盖瘿瘤本共一种，皆痰气结成，惟形有大小，及生颈项遍身之殊耳。立斋云：肝统筋，怒动肝火，血燥筋挛，曰筋瘤。心主血，劳役火动，阴火沸腾，外邪所搏而为肿，曰血瘤。脾主肉，郁结伤脾，肌肉消薄，外邪搏而为肿，曰肉瘤。肺主气，劳动元气，腠理不密，外邪搏而为肿，曰气瘤。肾主骨，劳伤肾水，不能荣骨而为肿，曰骨瘤。瘤之名有五者此也。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>仁斋云：筋脉呈露曰筋瘿，赤脉交络曰血瘿，皮色不变曰肉瘿，随忧愁消长曰气瘿，坚鞕不可移曰石瘿。瘿之名有五者此也。瘿瘤俱内应五脏，药治相同。　　瘿瘤所以两名者，以瘿形似樱桃，一边肿大似樱桃，垂皮宽而不急，原因忧恚所生，故又曰瘿气，今之所谓影囊者是也；瘤初起如梅李，皮嫩而光，渐如石榴瓜瓠之状，原因七情劳役，复被外邪生痰聚瘀随气留住，故又曰瘤。总皆气血凝滞结成，惟忧恚耗伤心肺，故瘿多着颈项及肩；劳欲邪气乘经之虚而作，故瘤随处有之。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　瘿瘤或软或鞕，无痛无痒，体实者，海藻散坚丸、海带丸；痰火盛者，舐掌散、神效开结散。此皆化痰行气破坚之剂，久虚者不可妄服。虚者：筋瘤，肾气丸，或八物汤加山栀、木瓜、炒黑龙胆草；肝火盛者，间以芦荟丸暂服。血瘤，四物汤加茯苓，远志。肉瘤，归脾汤、补中益气汤。骨瘤，肾气丸、补中益气汤，　　通用：初起者，十六味流气饮、单蜘蛛方；稍久者，蜡矾丸，常服自然缩小消磨。外敷南星膏，切不可轻用针刀决破，破则脓血崩溃，渗漏无已，必至杀人。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>但有一种脂瘤红粉色，全是痰结，用利刀破去脂粉则愈。或有如茄垂下，根甚小者，用药点其蒂，俟茄落，即用生肌敛口药敷之，防其出血。　　疣多患于手背及指间，或如黄豆大，或如聚粟，或如熟葚，拔之则丝长三四寸许，又曰手背发。　　风热血燥筋缩者，八味逍遥散加黄连，或清肝益荣汤。怒动肝火者，柴胡清肝汤。亡精肾枯筋缩者，肾气丸。误用寒凉降火之药，及螳螂蚀、蜘蛛丝缠、芫花浆线系、着艾灸等法，轻者反剧，实者大溃，肿痛发热，出血而死，慎之！　　(疒九)疮如鱼鳞痣，与千日疮一样，多生手足，又名晦气疮。宜艾灸初起者，则余者皆落，神效。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>　　　　证治准绳 【明　王肯堂】</p>

<p>Chapter on True and False Evils of Needle Insertion</p>
<p>When the external evils invade the body, they penetrate deeply. Cold and heat clash; if they linger too long and settle within, if cold triumphs over heat, it results in bone pain and withered flesh. If heat surpasses cold, it leads to decayed flesh and corrupted muscle, causing pus. Internal damage occurs to the bones, resulting in bone erosion. </p>
<p>If there is an ailment in a tendon, the tendon may bend and cannot extend. The evil qi resides therein, and does not revert, manifesting as a tendon knot. If there is a blockage, qi is directed towards it, and defensive qi remains, unable to revert. Fluids linger for an extended time, merging into intestinal knots, and over many years it may form. When pressed, it feels soft. </p>
<p>If a blockage is already present, with qi directed to it and fluids remaining, if evil qi penetrates it, the congestion will worsen over time, connecting and compounding into a former tumor, which feels hard to the touch. </p>
<p>If a blockage occurs deep within the bones, the qi derives from the bones; when the bones and qi are coupled, it will progressively enlarge, becoming a bone carbuncle. </p>
<p>If a blockage is in the flesh, the vital qi is directed towards it, with evil remaining and not departing. If there is heat, it transforms into pus; if there is no heat, it results in flesh carbuncle. </p>
<p>All of these types of qi manifest without a consistent external location but have fixed names such as withered flesh, bone erosion, tendon knots, and former tumors. </p>
<p>[Note: This text states that physical injury leads to sickness in qi, and injury to qi leads to sickness in the body. The blockages of qi are influenced by the clash of cold and heat, returning to the form where evils stagnate. These types of qi may arise from variable locations, but have defined names like withered flesh, bone erosion, tendon knots, and former tumors.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>This condition originates from the lung meridian. It may occur when the mother, during conception, does not observe taboos, and due to drunkenness or exposure to wind in a room, she becomes susceptible to malefic energies. The lung is considered the cover of the five organs; therefore, lung wind manifests externally as sparrow spots. It is advisable to use a wind-dispelling herbal ointment for treatment.<br>— <em>Three Causes Prescription</em> [Song Dynasty, Chen Wuze]</p>

<h3>Goiter</h3>
<p>Goiters are often located on the shoulders and neck, and they form due to the accumulation of Qi. These conditions typically develop over many years, gradually increasing in size and becoming hard and immovable, referred to as stone goiters. If the skin color does not change, it is termed a flesh goiter; if the veins protrude, it is again called a stone goiter; if there are red, intertwined veins, it is a blood goiter; and if it fluctuates with worries, it is known as a qi goiter. All five types of goiter should not be rashly incised; if ruptured, it can lead to pus and blood loss, often resulting in early death. There are six types of tumors: bone tumor, lipoma, gas tumor, flesh tumor, pus tumor, and blood tumor, which should also not be incised. The flesh tumor is particularly dangerous to cut; should it be treated in such a way, it may be fatal. Only the lipoma can be cut and, once the fatty tissue is removed, it can heal.<br>— <em>Ruminations on Filial Piety</em> [Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng]</p>

<h3>Goiter</h3>
<p>Goiters are cysts that cause pressure. As Ji Shuye stated in his &quot;On Health Preservation&quot;: &quot;When the neck resembles a hazard due to goiter, it is due to water.&quot; One may use a ginseng goiter-dissolving pill to alleviate it. Additionally, three ingredients — kelp, seaweed, and kombu — all from the sea, if two of these are placed in a jar of water and consumed regularly, can also help in resolving the issue.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Goiter</strong>  </p>
<p>To treat goiter, one must first eliminate rich flavors.<br>A lump, whether located in the neck, arm, or body, often resembles an abscess. This is mostly due to damp phlegm accumulation, resulting in a lump that does not disperse.  </p>

<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the liver governs tendons and stores blood; the heart encapsulates blood and controls the vessels; the spleen governs flesh and regulates blood; the lungs dominate qi and manage the pores; the kidneys govern bones and manage water. If anger stirs the liver fire, causing blood depletion and muscle contraction, it may result in swelling of the tendons, which, upon palpation, feels like tendons and may eventually develop blood threads; this is called a tendon tumor, treated with Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill, Four Substance Decoction, and herbal remedies like gardenia and papaya. If anger stirs the liver fire, causing yin blood to boil and external pathogens to clash and swell, it may result in muscle swelling, eventually appearing red, and the skin may also appear red; this is termed a blood tumor, treated with Four Substance Decoction, Poria, and herbal remedies like polygala. If stagnation injures the spleen, leading to thin and wasted muscles, and external pathogens strike and cause swelling, causing soft swelling of the muscles upon palpation; this is called a flesh tumor, treated with Restore the Spleen and Tonify Qi Decoction. If labor injures lung qi, making the pores loose, and external pathogens clash and cause an obstruction and swelling, causing soft swelling of the skin upon palpation; this is called a qi tumor, treated with revitalizing remedies.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the kidneys&#39; water is damaged due to overstrain, causing the bones not to be nourished and resulting in swelling, and if the swelling originates from the bones and is hard to the touch, it is called a bone tumor. This can be treated with the Rehmannia Pill and the Renowned Qi-boosting Decoction. A tumor indicates stagnation, arising from injuries to the organs, leading to disharmony of qi and blood; thus, one should seek to treat the root cause. Generally, if it belongs to the liver and gallbladder meridians, the Eight Treasures Decoction with gardenia and gentian can be used to nourish qi and blood and clear liver fire. The Six Flavors Pill can nourish lung metal to generate kidney water. If it pertains to liver fire and blood dryness, one needs to cool and nourish the blood with the Four Substances, two types of Rehmannia, peony, wine-fried black gentian, and gardenia. For those with weakened central qi, the Renowned Qi-boosting Decoction should be taken in tandem. If treatment is not applied correctly, it may lead to spleen and stomach deficiency, weakened nutritive qi, and an inability to nourish the affected area; or if cold stagnates at the sore, the nourishing qi may fail to nourish the area, resulting in failure to regenerate muscle and leading to a chronic sore. In this case, one must adjust and tonify the spleen and stomach to strengthen qi and blood, allowing the muscles to regenerate naturally. If one becomes careless with diet, lifestyle, the six excesses, or the seven emotions, or uses cooling and corrosive medicines, such as applying spider silk or convolvulus, to treat the exterior, it is indeed a mistake.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Warts</strong></p>
<p>Warts belong to the category of wind-heat and blood dryness associated with the gallbladder and lesser yang channel. They may arise from liver anger causing fire, or from the pernicious influences of lust affecting the liver. The heat in the liver dries up its moisture, leading to insufficient kidney energy, which results in the depletion of essence and muscle spasms. It is advisable to use Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water, thereby generating liver blood. If one resorts to wrapping with spider silk, using mantis bites, or applying moxibustion, it will likely lead to many mistakes. Generally, this condition resembles the dryness and clumping of blood; therefore, external corrosive methods and internal consumption of drying blood and detoxifying substances will worsen the depletion of essence and blood. The liver&#39;s tendons will be injured, and the wound will bulge and open unexpectedly, leading to failure of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Nodular Goiter Warts (Disease Nine)</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally, there are five types of goiter and six types of tumors, but Xue Lizhai only mentions five tumors. Essentially, goiters and tumors are one kind; both are formed by phlegm and qi clumping, differing only in size and their location on the neck and body. Lizhai states: the liver manages the tendons; when anger stirs the liver fire, blood becomes dry and the tendons contract, resulting in what is called a tendon tumor. The heart governs blood; when overexerted, fire stirs, yin fire boils, and external pathogens invade, causing swelling, termed a blood tumor. The spleen governs flesh; when it is blocked and injured, the flesh becomes thin, and when external pathogens strike, it results in swelling, termed a flesh tumor. The lungs govern qi; when exerted, original qi weakens, pores are loose, and external pathogens strike, leading to swelling, termed a qi tumor. The kidneys govern bones; when they are overworked, renal water cannot nourish the bones, resulting in swelling, termed a bone tumor. These are the five names for tumors.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Book of Ren Zhai states: When tendons and veins protrude, it is called tendon goiter; when red veins intertwine, it is called blood goiter; when the skin color does not change, it is called flesh goiter; when it grows and shrinks with worries and sorrows, it is called qi goiter; when it is hard and immovable, it is called stone goiter. These are the five names for goiter. Goiters correspond to the five internal organs, and their treatment with medicine is the same.</p>
<p>The reason why goiters have two names is that their shape resembles a cherry, with one side enlarged like a cherry, the skin sagging wide and not urgent. They are caused by worries and anger, hence they are also called qi goiter; what is now referred to as a shadow sack is this. Initially, the tumor appears like a plum or a peach, with tender and smooth skin, gradually resembling a pomegranate or gourd. This is due to the labor of the seven emotions and the influence of external pathogens leading to phlegm accumulation and stagnation of qi. Therefore, it is also called a tumor. In summary, these are all formed by the stagnation and congealing of qi and blood. Worries and anger deplete the heart and lungs, hence goiters are often found on the neck and shoulders. Labor and external pathogenic influences take advantage of the deficiency in the meridians, thus tumors can occur anywhere.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

For blood tumors, use Si Wu Decoction with Poria and Yuan Zhi. For flesh tumors, use Gui Pi Decoction or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. For bone tumors, use Shen Qi Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. General treatments: for early stages, use Shi Liu Wei Liu Qi Yin or Dan Zhizhu Fang; for those that have persisted, use Wax Alum Pill, taking it regularly to gradually reduce size. Externally, apply Nan Xing ointment, but absolutely avoid using needles or knives, as breaking it will lead to pus and blood bursting out, leaking uncontrollably, which could be fatal.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

<p>For tumors, when Qi condenses within the skin, they suddenly swell, resembling plums and peaches, with soft and shiny skin, gradually forming shapes like cups or eggs. If they are soft and painless, they are blood tumors; if they gradually swell without significant heat and cause occasional pulling pain, they are Qi tumors. When Qi is slightly blocked and remains swollen for a long time, it may eventually turn to pus. All tumors and growths will self-resolve naturally with age. Treatment in young adults may prevent future concerns. If upon palpation they can be moved, one may consider removing them. If they cannot be moved, they should not be removed. Tumors come in all sizes, and one should not recklessly decide on removal without proper assessment, as this could endanger life. Common wisdom suggests that tumors should be left alone; they should not be lightly removed, which is not without reason.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Method of Treatment: First, apply iron pot salve to the top of the tumor, allowing the flesh to blacken and rot without pain, so that it can then be cut away. Additionally, apply medicine to cause the flesh to rot completely, making it ready for cutting. Alternate between applying and cutting until the root of the tumor is entirely removed. If one fears needles or knives, instead apply Jinjinsan to darken the flesh to an extreme degree and cause complete rotting before using knives or scrapers. If any flesh remains not fully blackened, it may not be dead; if the flesh is not dead, the blood is also alive, and if the blood is alive, it cannot be cut or scraped, as this may lead to excessive bleeding and cause fainting. Only when the flesh is entirely blackened and significantly rotted, to the point that it can be moved, is it truly dead. Once the flesh is dead, the blood is also dead, and the dead blood can be cut or scraped away without issue. Even when treating blood tumors or flesh tumors, it is permissible to remove them. Small tumors can be removed for immediate recovery. For large tumors, if there is muscle numbness for half a year, it is advisable to take tonic medicines to nourish the qi and blood, which will eventually lead to healing over time.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Goiter</strong></p>
<p>In humans, the condition of goiter arises not from the stagnation of Yin and Yang正气 (vital energy) but from the stasis of blood and the accumulation of turbid Qi and phlegm within the five internal organs. Goiter is associated with Yang, characterized by red color and protrusion, sometimes with a small stalk hanging down. A tumor, on the other hand, is associated with Yin, characterized by a white color and diffuse swelling, usually without itch or pain, unnoticeable to the person. Xue Lizhai provides a detailed distinction. The liver governs tendons; when anger provokes liver fire, causing dryness in the blood and spasms in the tendons, it is termed a tendon tumor; the heart governs blood; excessive suddenness can cause the fire to stir the blood to boil, additionally affected by external pathogens leading to swelling, referred to as a blood tumor; the spleen governs muscles; if there is stagnation harming the spleen, the muscles become thin and weak, with Earth Qi failing to circulate, resulting in swelling within the flesh, called a flesh tumor; the lungs govern Qi; overwork damages the original Qi, with pores not being tightly sealed, and external cold leading to swelling, termed a Qi tumor; the kidneys govern bones; excessive indulgence can harm the kidneys, causing kidney fire to be constrained, leading to insufficient nourishment of the bones, resulting in swelling referred to as a bone tumor.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

If it resembles a stem of eggplant and is large and drooping, one should apply medicine to its base; when the eggplant falls, it will promote tissue growth and contraction. If there is persistent purulent discharge and the formation doesn’t diminish, one should primarily strengthen the spleen and stomach, assisted by methods to resolve hardness. In cases of rupture with infrequent bleeding and an open, oozing formation, it is advisable to nourish and cool the blood, assisted by methods to clear the liver. After rupture, if the swelling gradually decreases but the spleen remains weak and cannot contract, one should tonify kidney energy and assist the spleen and stomach.</p>

<p>Due to sorrow, the liver suffers, lacking nourishment, leading to the external emergence of tendon energy. Initially, it appears the size of a red bean with slight elevation.

<p><strong>Tumors and Growths</strong></p>
<p>According to the evidence regarding tumors and growths, as previously discussed by Xue Ji, the details have been thoroughly addressed. However, among the five types of tumors, the powdery tumor is the most common. This occurs when the pores and channels are blocked, causing condensation that does not disperse, gradually forming a tumor; it is also a type of acne, differing only in depth. The deeper ones are beneath the skin and gradually enlarge into tumors. I have heard from my predecessors that larger tumors are most feared for their potential to rupture; unless they contain pus, they should not be opened. If opened, they may involve surrounding channels, causing leakage of blood and qi, leading to difficult recovery, with no one surviving. This has been confirmed by detailed investigations into several cases recorded by Xue—those that ruptured were all untreatable, indeed a truth that must be recognized.</p>
<p>The method of tying with spider silk can treat smaller tumors effectively, and this technique is quite remarkable. I once saw a person with a tumor on the abdomen, as large as a walnut; a practitioner took spider silk and twisted it into a thick thread, wrapping it around the base. After a few days, the silk gradually tightened and the base became thinner. After repeated adjustments, it eventually fell off within days; it truly is a wondrous method. One can see that while the threads relax over time, the spider silk tightens, demonstrating the principles of nature. However, it is also important to apply this method early; if the condition becomes too large, it may no longer be suitable.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Different Treatments for Goiters</strong></p>
<p>Goiters vary in type: a goiter (瘿) grows connected to the flesh, with a large root and large body; while a tumor (瘤) has a small root but a large body. Within tumors, there are further distinctions: there are powder tumors, flesh tumors, sinew tumors, and substance tumors. Sinew tumors cannot be treated and do not need treatment, as they will only grow to the size of a walnut over a lifetime of ten years. Powder tumors will naturally expel powder resembling incense ash after three years and will heal on their own, requiring no treatment. Flesh tumors are the easiest to treat; use one qian of mercury and borax, three qian each of daemonorops, dragon&#39;s blood, three fen of borneol and musk, and five qian of huangbai, all ground into a fine powder. Apply this medicine to the root of the tumor, and it will fall away as you apply it. For those with small roots, none will remain. Substance tumors, however, with large roots, are the most difficult to treat. They may occasionally move and make sounds, resembling insect chirps or bird calls. It is essential to use a knife to open a hole, allowing the substance to escape; this will ensure it cannot remain and will create an outlet. Afterward, use a wound-healing miraculous medicine to dress the area, and the tumor will dissolve into water, returning to its normal state.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This behavior shows disrespect to the spirits and offends the God of the Year, leading to an illness that cannot be measured or discussed through reason; therefore, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; does not mention it. However, this illness has never been absent from the world. For treatment, use a mixture of myrrh and frankincense to remove oil, with one qian each of elephant skin, sandalwood powder, and ginseng; three qian of Panax notoginseng (Sanqi) root powder, and three qian of millennium lime; five fen of talcum powder; two qian each of Kirin blood extract and catechu; and three fen of borneol, ground into extremely fine powder, ground quietly as measured.</p>
<p>The treatment must be done on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, and no one else should see it. The tumors vary in form, but they are all caused by damp-heat. They grow from small to large, from large to rupture, and ultimately lead to death. At the onset, it is advisable to use a small knife to cut and slightly release white fluid, then apply the skin-regenerating powder for immediate healing. If treatment is neglected and the condition worsens, use a little medicine to apply to the depressed area; if it causes pain within half a day, fluid will be sure to emerge, and if it is white, recovery is easy; if it is yellow or red, recovery is difficult. However, taking this medicine will ensure healing.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To prepare the medicine, use 1 qian each of mercury, borax, light powder, eagle droppings, magpie droppings, green vitriol, and soap alum, along with 5 fen each of borneol and ice flakes, and 3 fen of musk, grind them into an extremely fine powder. Use a needle to prick a small hole, then, while it is bleeding, apply the medicine to cause adhesion. Approximately 1 fen is to be mixed with human milk for application, the size of a chicken egg, applied three times a day. By the second day, there will certainly be a flow; during the flow, do not apply the medicine, for if it causes excessive pain, closure will be difficult. After three days, the flow will certainly cease and the skin will be as loose as a pouch. Then, use the following decoction to naturally restore it: 3 qian each of ginseng and yam, 5 qian each of poria and white peony, 1 liang each of coix and astragalus, 2 qian of alisma, and 1 qian each of polyporus, raw licorice, and dried tangerine peel. Boil with water to take, ten doses will completely restore it to normal. However, avoid sexual activity for a month; there are no other restrictions. If you engage in sexual activity, it will definitely break and will not close, becoming a lifelong leak.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a person has a sickness where a sore develops on the arm, growing to the size of a fist, it must be cut away with a knife; otherwise, the person will suffer greatly and should not attempt this. I have an extraordinary remedy that only requires a small knife to slightly remove a layer of skin, after which a powdered medicine is applied to it, and it will dissolve into water—this is a miraculous method. The formula includes three qian of ginseng, one qian of licorice, one fen each of borax and borneol, and half a fen of light powder, which are all ground into a powder and mixed together; this will cause it to dissolve into water. This remedy is indeed a remarkable antidote and should not be underestimated. </p>
<p>Moreover, if someone has a sore on the abdomen that forms a stubborn lump and does not go away for a year, the same method can be applied for immediate results. If a person has a tumor on their foot the size of a dou (a unit of measure), it need not be ruptured; simply use a needle to lightly prick a small hole and apply the previous medicine, causing fluid to flow continuously. A decoction must also be used. The formula consists of three liang each of ginseng and astragalus, five liang each of fresh licorice and coix seeds, and three qian of white mustard seeds, all boiled in water. Two doses will completely eliminate the fluid without the person appearing weary; this is a method of treating both internally and externally. </p>
<p>The essence of this formula lies in replenishing the source of vital energy and enhancing fluid movement without losing the energy. By pricking a hole to release the fluid, it may result in significant depletion of the vital energy; hence, replenishing the energy eliminates any fear of fluid excessively exiting.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Jiexia Chushi Decoction treats damp-heat accumulation, stagnation of qi and blood, forming nodules or tumors in the lower body. Ingredients include: seaweed, huangbo (phelodendron bark), sanleng (sparganium), xiangfu (cyperus), qingpi (green tangerine peel), stir-fried zhizi (gardenia fruit), lianqiao (forsythia), binglang (betel nut), and mutong (mu tong). These should be decocted with mint.</p>
<p>Kuliu Ointment treats six types of lumps, swelling, and hemorrhoids. If this ointment is unavailable, it can be replaced with iron can ointment for quicker effect. The ingredients are: four taels of cao wu (aconite), two taels of chuan wu (chuan aconite), one and a half taels each of dry mulberry ear and mulberry decayed wood, and one bowl each of mineral lime, mulberry wood ash, and buckwheat straw ash. Combine the four herbal ingredients, burn them into ash, then mix with mineral lime, mulberry wood ash, and buckwheat straw ash, and place everything into a wine strainer, sealing the strainer with palm fiber. Boil two dou (about 4 liters) of water and pour over the mixture, simmering on low heat until concentrated. Aim for ten bowls to yield one bowl, storing in a thick, sealed ceramic container. When using, mix with mineral lime to form a paste, applying it on top of the tumor with damp paper layered on. If it’s not dry, do not apply more. If the paste dries for a long time, add saliva to adjust. Continue until it turns black and rotten; scrape it off with a knife when flesh is not entirely gone, then continue to apply and scrape. If there is fear of scraping, use Jingjin powder to gradually encourage rotting, avoiding needles and knives; finally, apply the ointment to remove all rotten flesh.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

<p>For goiter under the throat: Use naturally sourced copper to store water in a jar, and daily consume this water with your meals; the goiter will dissolve on its own. Alternatively, you can burn the copper and inhale the smoke for a long duration. Another remedy: Place needle sand in a water tank to soak; use the water for meals, change the sand every ten days, and it will dissolve in half a year.</p>
<p>For goiter under the throat: Take one sheng of mouse sticky root and three sheng of water, boil down to one and a half sheng, and divide into three doses. Alternatively, you can grind it to powder, mix with honey, and take regularly.</p>
<p>For goiter: One sheng of yellow medicine root, wash with a knife, soak in one dou of wine, and take one cup every morning and evening. Avoid all toxic substances and manage anger. Measure daily progress with a thread to assess effectiveness.</p>
<p>For goiter: Use one jin of seaweed, put it in a silk bag, soak in two sheng of clear wine for two days in spring and summer, and three days in autumn and winter; take two he (a Japanese measurement) three times daily. Make a new batch when the wine runs out; dry the residue and grind it to a powder, taking a piece the size of a thumb daily—usually just two doses will suffice.</p>
<p>For early-stage goiter: Grind one or two liang of seaweed and Chinese goldthread into powder, and suck on it occasionally. First, stop consuming all rich foods.</p>
<p>For five goiter nodules, hard and protruding: Take one liang of kelp, wash off the salt, dry it, and grind it to powder. Wrap it in cotton, soak in vinegar, and hold it in the mouth while swallowing the juice, replacing it once the flavor is gone.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Qian Jin Fang&quot; states: For goiters, caused by harmful Qi, moxibustion is to be applied at Tian Fu fifty times. Goiters accompanied by shortness of breath require moxibustion at Lung Shu a hundred times. Goiters causing chest fullness should receive moxibustion at Yun Men fifty times. For goiters related to fatigue, apply moxibustion at Chong Yang annually. In cases of face swelling due to goiters, moxibustion at Tong Tian fifty times is advised. </p>
<p>Goiters should be treated with moxibustion at Tian Liao three hundred times, horizontally one inch apart; additionally, moxibustion at Zhong Feng should be done annually, specifically at the inner curves beneath both feet.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Xi Hua, a healer was met with scorn from the crowd who believed he was merely vomiting. One day, Wei Shouzhi accompanied the healer to a food establishment, where they encountered a man suffering from a tumor located at the corner of his eye. It appeared gray and hung down over his vision, preventing him from seeing. The healer said to Shouzhi, &quot;I won&#39;t wait for the food to cook; I will remove this tumor immediately.&quot; Wei was skeptical. The healer then proposed, &quot;What if I take this tumor out for you?&quot; The man replied that others had been too afraid to cut it. The healer insisted, &quot;I won&#39;t use a knife; I have another technique.&quot; The man agreed and was led to a small room where he was instructed to lie supine on a bed, with his leg tied down. The healer then punctured the tumor, causing a significant amount of blood to flow. First, he massaged the man&#39;s eye; the tumor then expelled a clump of dark matter, and it was removed entirely. Shouzhi was astonished. The healer remarked, &quot;Is it possible that a person with skill can be observed fully?&quot;</p>
<p>In Gao City, which is the healer&#39;s hometown, there was an unmarried woman, eighteen years old, with tumors on both her hands that resembled chicken claws and ram&#39;s horns. Her wrists could not bend, and in the light of day, they appeared like peach gum. Her prospective husband&#39;s family wanted to abandon her, but the healer took a look and said, &quot;The tumor on her hand is a gel tumor, and the one on her face is a powder tumor. This is a gel tumor.&quot; He used a specialized needle to break it open and squeezed out three spoonfuls of yellow gel-like pus, after which the tumor flattened and would not reappear.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; states: In the spring of the Xin Chou year, Wang Tianjue of Changzhou suffered from a tumor on his left leg, shaped like a large peach, soft to the touch. He diligently took medicine to eliminate dampness, promote qi, and transform phlegm. He experienced chills, fever, decreased appetite, fatigue, and overall weakness; his pulse was robust yet vacuous, indicating a qi tumor associated with the lungs. Since the gallbladder relates to wood and the lungs to metal, the condition arose in the gallbladder meridian, where lung metal overcomes liver wood, leading to a depletion of original qi, and the pus had already festered internally.</p>
<p>He subsequently took several doses of the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction, which expelled a considerable amount of clear, thin pus. However, his condition worsened, manifesting as chills and fever, intense thirst, and headache, resembling a typhoid state. I surmised that this was due to the pus draining out, further depleting his blood and qi. He continued taking the previous decoction, but his condition exacerbated with a pulse that was large and rapid, feeling as though there was nothing there. Thus, I added one qian of Fuzi (Aconite) to the prescription, yet the situation worsened and the pulse returned to its prior state, indicating an extreme deficiency beyond the medicine’s reach. I then increased the Fuzi to two qian, and after three doses, the symptoms diminished significantly.</p>
<p>In the morning, he took the Qi-tonifying Decoction, and in the evening, he took the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction, each more than thirty doses, resulting in the expulsion of five pieces of necrotic bone, and the wound was nearly healed. Later, due to negligence in daily activities, the affected area festered again, and symptoms intensified. He experienced a burning sensation in his throat and had no skin on his lips and tongue. I prescribed the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction with an addition of one qian of Fuzi, and all symptoms resolved. However, after two days without medication, the internal issues returned along with the festering.</p>
<p>Two years later, he suffered again, and the previous medication was ineffective. Upon examining his pulse, it was thin like a silk thread, indicating that the Mingmen fire had weakened. I prescribed the Eight Flavor Pill as the principal treatment, assisted by the Ten Complete Tonifying Decoction, which resulted in slight improvement. By the Yi Si year, he still suffered from symptoms of deficiency and cold, eventually passing away.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

This was a condition of the gallbladder meridian, hence it appeared on the outer side of the leg. Upon diagnosing his pulse, it was found to be forceful and rapid on the left wrist, and string-like and forceful on the right. This indicated that the kidney&#39;s water could not nourish the liver&#39;s wood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Jia Shan, a person named Zhou had a swelling between the ears and under the jaw, with hardened and congested muscles, coughing, and shortness of breath. They experienced internal heat and night sweats. The treatments they took were all aimed at resolving phlegm, dispersing hardness, and promoting the flow of energy, but their condition worsened. Upon examination, I found the left pulse weak and the left wrist pulse rapid, indicating that anger had harmed the liver and excessive work had damaged the kidneys. I advised nourishing kidney water and generating liver blood, and to be careful in regulating their activities. When water was abundant, it might lead to recovery. However, wanting quick results, they applied external medicinal pastes of herbs like smartweed and lime, and took internal remedies like seaweed and aconite. By autumn, as the elemental metal flourished, their vitality diminished further, leading to a worse swelling and eventual death.</p>
<p>In Zhenjiang, a person named Sun had a swelling between the legs resembling an overturned bowl, hard in texture and red in color, with internal heat and evening fevers, accompanied by spontaneous sweating and night sweats. They sought my treatment, stating that their ailment was being treated with remedies aimed at dispelling hardness, promoting energy flow, and reducing fire, but this only exacerbated their condition. Their left wrist pulse was rapid but weak, and the left pulse was rapid as well and hard upon pressure. This indicated that anger had harmed the liver, leading to blood depletion and muscle contraction. Due to their urgency for career advancement, I declined to treat them. They did not believe my warning and ultimately passed away. If this condition were treated by tonifying the spleen and lungs and nourishing the liver and kidneys, the wood would receive water and flourish, muscles would receive blood and moisten, leading to many surviving.</p>
<p>A student named Zhu Hongren, aged twenty, had five warts on each hand, with one large wart the size of a soybean, while the others resembled clusters of millet, pulling them off like silk and measuring about three or four inches in length.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the government school, Shen Jiwen, as a child, used to bite her nails and, upon growing up, could not control it. I said: This is due to excess liver fire and blood dryness. Additionally, she often had small warts on the side of her neck that would repeatedly break out and then disappear; she also had a spot on her arm the size of a mung bean that seemed to break like fragile thread: if tugged, it would grow; if relaxed, it would shrink. Later, the hair at her temples turned white, and she sought treatment. I said: You have had liver issues; this region is also related to the liver and gallbladder channels. Nails are residues of tendons, and the gallbladder runs along the side of the body, which corresponds to the complaints of biting nails and warts; you need to nourish the kidney water to support the liver and gallbladder, and then all illnesses will heal. Thus, I gave her the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. After two years, the white spots receded, and the warts no longer appeared.</p>
<p>One man had warts on his face that initially looked like red berries; after applying various ointments, they grew larger like fungi. Then he used caustics, and they expanded like tumors. This presented a complete deficiency of the three yin channels. I treated him with tonics for the spleen and lungs to nourish the liver and kidneys, and he soon recovered.</p>
<p>Another man had a spot in his lower abdomen that occasionally caused sharp pain. He tried using medications to move qi and dissolve phlegm, but they had no effect. He thought it might be related to blood clots and took qi-moving and blood-dispelling medicines. Later, a lump formed on the back of his hand that gradually grew to about an inch in size, resembling a turtle, with many small lumps appearing around his joints like mung beans. The mud turtle gives birth outward and requires blood-moving treatments. He had signs of deficiency, and his left wrist pulse was large, rapid, and string-like. I determined that the deficiency of kidney water was unable to nourish the liver wood, resulting in excess liver fire and muscle spasms. I prescribed the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to generate kidney water and nourish liver blood, and after a little more than three months, all his symptoms had improved.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another man, who regularly consumed rich foods and strong liquor, initially experienced bloody stools and constipation, anxiety, and insomnia.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman had multiple lesions on the back of her left hand and fingers, resembling ripe mulberries. She experienced internal heat and discomfort, with menstrual periods irregular and absent. I said this was due to deficiencies in the liver and spleen leading to heat. She should balance and nourish both channels, allowing the yin blood to grow, and then the symptoms would resolve on their own. Doubting this, she applied moxibustion, which caused swelling and heat in her hand, cramps in her fingers, and warts on her flanks, neck, and between her breasts, with menstruation still absent. I prescribed a modified version of Xiao Yao San with an added few doses of fried black Huang Lian, and she gradually improved. Then I removed Huang Lian and supplemented with Gui Pi Decoction, and her condition gradually got better. After about a hundred doses, her menstruation returned regularly. She then took three doses of Di Huang Wan and was cured.</p>
<p>Another woman had a mass in her lower abdomen, alternately causing upward pressure or downward heaviness, with chills and fever, chest tightness, and dribbling urination. I prescribed remedies to move qi and resolve phlegm, but these exacerbated her previous symptoms, resulting in over two months without menstruation. Some suspected there was a growth inside, and advised drinking its blood, leading her to take expelling remedies that caused significant blood loss. She had a wart on the back of each hand, each about the size of a large soybean, which grew to about an inch after two months, and she developed several more warts. Suspecting that the growths were linked to the external condition, I continued with the expelling treatments. She also developed swelling beneath both ears, suspected to be due to toxic sores. I concluded this was due to liver fire and blood dryness. I prescribed a combination of modified Xiao Yao and Gui Pi Decoction along with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, and after more than three months, she was cured.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

<p>According to &quot;The Authentic Text of External Medicine&quot;: A man had a tumor on his buttocks for five years, shaped like a covered gourd, which appeared dark when pressed. This was a black powder tumor. It was pierced with a needle, and dark sand and black powder were pressed out, amounting to about a bowl. A three-type needle was inserted into the affected area for over ten days, pressing out a black membrane each time, and the tumor gradually shrank. He also took a tonic soup to strengthen the spleen and stomach and nourish Qi and blood, and after a month, it healed.</p>
<p>A man developed a tumor on his cheek for six months, shaped like a covered peach, with unchanged skin color, which turned slightly red when pressed. This was a powder tumor.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A soldier from Yiwu had five small tumors growing under his shoulder. After more than three months, they began to itch and felt unusual. When he touched them, he could feel something moving inside. Upon examination, it indeed felt like shrimp. Therefore, it was certain that there was an unusual insect inside. I used a needle to pierce one of the tumors, and initially, a spoonful of red fluid came out, followed shortly by a black-tipped pink worm, which was unchanged. The patient gradually felt weak, which was a consequence of the fluid loss. I stopped the tumor&#39;s growth, treated him with several doses of a tonic to replenish energy, and covered the area with an ointment. After five or six days, the patient felt better and gradually resumed breaking it down. I continued with a tonic of over ten doses until he recovered.</p>
<p>A woman and a girl each had a tumor about an inch below their hairline behind the ear, which had grown gradually for more than half a year. This was a fatty tumor. I used a needle to break it, and initially, fatty powder came out, followed by several strands of hair, each about two feet long, which I cut off at the roots. A little blood was lost, and I applied some medicine. Within several days, the inner membrane dissolved and they recovered. From this, it is evident that tumors can develop from hair.</p>
<p>Another woman had a flesh tumor on her waist for over three years, which had begun to ache slightly. One day, it burst, releasing three small roundworms about five inches long, which swam in warm water before stopping after a while. At that time, the patient looked weak, her face pale and thin, dry mouth and feverish. In the morning, she took Eight-Flavored Pills, and in the afternoon, Ginseng Nourishing Decoction. After taking it for about a hundred days, her vitality gradually revived; another hundred days passed before her mouth closed. I assessed that the worms were transformed from the energy and blood within the meridians.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman developed a tumor on her body, red and purple, firm to the touch, which was identified as a blood tumor. Upon examination, both the heart and liver pulses were found to be strong and rapid, indicating that her condition was due to stagnation of heart energy and injury to liver energy. Treatment was deemed impossible. Later, she sought medical treatment in the capital, by which time the tumor had begun to ulcerate. Despite attempts to strengthen and cool her blood with various remedies, the ulcer worsened day by day, and ultimately, she did not respond to any further treatment. After two months of deterioration, a sudden gush of purple blood erupted, and she soon passed away. When later asked what caused this, I replied: the heart pulse was strong and rapid, indicating excess heart fire; the liver pulse was wiry and rapid, indicating liver injury. Excess heat forced the blood to flow erratically, while injured liver energy could not contain the blood, leading to uncontrolled bleeding when the tumor ruptured, often resulting in death. It was this reasoning that led me to advise against treatment.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue,&quot; I noted that beyond three weeks, I suddenly felt a small lump beneath my buttocks, in front of the anus, beneath the skin near the bone, initially no larger than a mung bean. I paid it no mind, but after six months, it grew to the size of a yellow bean, and after another year, it resembled a soap nut, then grew to the size of a chestnut. At this point, sitting on a horse or in a chair became uncomfortable, and it gradually became painful. I recognized that this couldn’t be resolved with external ointments or herbal decoctions. If it continued to grow, it would reach the size of a compartment and hang between my waist and hips, severely limiting movement, which could potentially render me immobile. This caused me deep concern. Advisers warned against surgery, fearing significant complications. After contemplating for several months, I found no one who dared to act impulsively.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I have secretly calculated that if I do not take action against this small issue now, it will only grow larger and harder to deal with in the future. What can be done about it? I have seen people who have been injured by arrows between their buttocks; they do not necessarily die from it. The pros and cons of this situation are somewhat similar, so I resolved to remove it. One day, feeling slightly tipsy from drinking, I took a willow needle and pierced it. What came out resembled the white skin of tofu, indeed, it was a small tumor. After piercing, it immediately shrank, and I felt quite pleased. However, two days later, it swelled like a hot abscess. I applied a medicated ointment, and after three days, it ruptured and healed, leaving me satisfied once more. </p>
<p>Yet, within two days it swelled again, hotter and larger, and I was filled with great fear and regret, believing that tumors should not be pierced. Nevertheless, I had no choice but to apply the medicated ointment again, and after another three days, it burst open, releasing something resembling a fish bladder, after which it closed up and fully healed. </p>
<p>Now, many years later, there remains a small pore, which is indeed a dangerous reminder. Had it not been for my decisive courage, I cannot imagine what might have happened later; had I delayed the procedure, it could have turned truly unmanageable. Thus, if a disease is not treated early, one cannot foresee the outcome; this serves as a lesson for those who treat illnesses.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>
