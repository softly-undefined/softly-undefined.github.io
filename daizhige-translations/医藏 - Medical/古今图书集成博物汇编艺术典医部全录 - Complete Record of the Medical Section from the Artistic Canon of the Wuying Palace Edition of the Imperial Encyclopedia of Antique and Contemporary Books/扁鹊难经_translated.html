      <div><p><strong>Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books: Medical Volume 69 - The Difficulties of Bian Que</strong></p>
<p><strong>Upper Classics</strong><br>【Hua Shou said: This book indeed has categories, but it should be like the &quot;Great Learning,&quot; where Zhu Xi divided the chapters to make the author&#39;s intentions clear, rather than uniting the chapters under one&#39;s own classification. Now, if we observe from the first difficulty to the twenty-first, all discuss the pulse; from the twenty-second to the twenty-ninth, they expound on the continuity and length of the meridians and their flow, the paths of the extraordinary vessels, and the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of diseases. Among them, it is stated: a pulse does not merely refer to the size of the pulse but rather the pulse of the meridians. From the thirtieth difficulty to the forty-third, the discussion focuses on the nourishing and protecting aspects, the triple burner, the organs, and the details of the intestines and stomach. The forty-fourth and forty-fifth difficulties discuss the seven pathways that serve the nourishment of the body, while the eight gatherings concern the vital points of heat diseases within. The forty-sixth and forty-seventh difficulties discuss the waking and sleeping of young and old as a reflection of the abundance or deficiency of qi and blood, and mention how a person&#39;s face can endure cold to indicate the movement of yin and yang.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>From the forty-eighth to the sixty-first difficulties, it discusses diagnosis, understanding of ailments, the organs and their functions, accumulation and release, cold damage, and the distinctions of miscellaneous diseases. Following this are the methods of observation, listening, inquiry, and pulse-taking—these are the complete skills of a physician. From the sixty-second to the eighty-first difficulties, it speaks of the organ’s strengths and weaknesses and the methods of acupuncture for replenishing and draining, which are essential to the study of the entire body. The author has thoroughly documented the intent of progressively related topics.</p>
<p>Hua Shou states: &quot;The right inch corresponds to the Taiyin and Yangming Metal, producing the left cubit of the Taiyang and Shaoyin Water; the Taiyang and Shaoyin Water gives rise to the left guan of the Jueyin and Shaoyang Wood; the Jueyin and Shaoyang Wood produce the left inch of the Taiyang and Shaoyin Fire; the Taiyang and Shaoyin Fire connects to the right cubit of the Shen and the Master of Shaoyang Fire; the Master of Shaoyang Fire generates the right guan of the Taiyin and Yangming Earth; the Taiyin and Yangming Earth further produces the right inch of the Taiyin and Yangming Metal. These are all processes of generation and nourishment within the Five Elements.&quot; </p>
<p>Diagrams related to the flows of the meridians beginning from the middle burner are referenced.</p>
<p>Diagrams showing the relations of overflow and obstruction are referenced.</p>
<p>Diagrams indicating the births of males and females in the Yin and Shen times are referenced.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The Diagram of the Five Elements and the Interactions Between Mother and Child<br>See the diagram  </p>

<p>[Yu said: The classics state that a boy is born in the year of Yin (Tiger), and a girl in the year of Shen (Monkey), meaning their parents&#39; ages converge in the year of Si (Snake). A boy&#39;s journey goes left for ten months, culminating in Yin and birth; a girl&#39;s journey goes right for ten months, culminating in Shen and birth. Thus, according to destiny scholars, a boy begins at the first year with Bing Yin, and a girl begins at the first year with Ren Shen. The &#39;Nan Jing&#39; does not mention the beginning, but rather states that being born equates to already being one year old. Ren and Bing are the two heavenly stems representing Water and Fire, the parents of all things; Yin and Shen are the two earthly branches representing Metal and Wood, marking the beginning and end of the natural order. Wood is abundant in Shen, and Metal is abundant in Yin; these two energies correspond well, thus both Yin and Shen are utilized. Metal emerges in Si, which is paired with Shen, hence girls involve Shen; Wood emerges in Hai, which is paired with Yin, hence boys involve Yin. Therefore, when a boy is ten years old, he follows the path through Hai; when a girl is seven years old, she also moves towards Hai in the reverse direction. A boy at sixteen experiences Tian Gui in Si, progressing left to engage the vital energy of Si; a girl at fourteen experiences Tian Gui also in Si, aligned in the same palace of vital energy as the boy. The matching of Yin and Yang thus establishes the path of husband and wife, which is why there are male and female. The ancient text on natural simplicity states: When a boy reaches the age of sixteen and experiences Tian Gui, his essence overflows, and Yin and Yang harmonize, thus he can have offspring. When a girl reaches the age of fourteen and experiences Tian Gui, her Ren Meridian opens, and the Tai Chong Meridian thrives, thus she can have offspring. This is what it refers to.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Diagram of the Rise and Fall of Pure and Impure</strong><br>See diagram</p>

<p><em>[Note: The old edition of &quot;Illustrations of the Difficult Classics&quot; is redundant and contains many errors, particularly with the diagrams related to the twelve meridians, which are especially mixed up. Such inaccuracies being perpetuated over time obscure the true principles of Xuanqi. Is this acceptable? The current compilation has corrected and supplemented mistakes to the best of its knowledge.]</em><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>One question asks: Why is it that among the twelve channels, which all have arteries, only the pulse at the wrist is used to determine the life and death, fortune and misfortune of the five organs and six bowels?</p>
<p>[Hua Shou replies: The twelve channels refer to the three yin and three yang of the hands and feet, totaling twelve. The channels of the hands are: Taiyin of the Lung, Yangming of the Large Intestine, Shaoyin of the Heart, Taiyang of the Small Intestine, Jueyin of the Pericardium, and Shaoyang of the Triple Burner. The channels of the feet are: Taiyin of the Spleen, Yangming of the Stomach, Shaoyin of the Kidney, Taiyang of the Bladder, Jueyin of the Liver, and Shaoyang of the Gallbladder. All have arteries branching out, such as the hand Taiyin pulse at Zhongfu, Yunmen, Tianfu, and Xiabai; the hand Yangming pulse at Hegu and Yangxi; the hand Shaoyin pulse at Jizhong; the hand Taiyang pulse at Tiankuang; the hand Jueyin pulse at Laogong; the hand Shaoyang pulse at Helyao; the foot Taiyin pulse at Jimen and Chongmen; the foot Yangming pulse at Chongyang, Daying, Renying, and Qichong; the foot Shaoyin pulse at Daxie and Yingu; the foot Taiyang pulse at Weizhong; the foot Jueyin pulse at Taichong, Wuli, and Yinlian; the foot Shaoyang pulse at Xiaguan and Tinghui, among others. The term “channel” indicates that the flow of nourishment and defense circulates constantly. The term “pulse” refers to the segmented distribution of blood throughout the body. Therefore, channels are direct pathways, while pulses are side paths. The meaning implies that all twelve channels have arteries as mentioned above, so why is only the pulse at the wrist chosen to determine the life and death of the organs?]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Indeed, the inch pulse is the great meeting point of the pulse, and it reflects the motion of the Hand Taiyin channel. </p>
<p>[Huashou explains: The main purpose of this passage will be elaborated in the following text. The inch pulse is the pulse of qi. Residing at the fish border of the Hand Taiyin, it is measured by a division of one inch. Below the qi pulse are the points called Guan and Chi, which are all places traversed by the Hand Taiyin, and the Hand Taiyin is the origin of the flow of the hundred pulses as they converge. As for the five viscera, there is a separate discussion; the sovereign asks: why does the qi pulse exclusively govern the five viscera? Qibo replies: the stomach is the sea of water and grain, and the major source of the six intestines. The five flavors enter through the mouth, are stored in the stomach, nourish the qi of the five viscera, and manifest at the qi pulse. The first chapter of the &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: the pulse converges at Taiyuan. The Jade Tablet discourse states: the method of regulating the extraordinary and the consistent begins with Taiyin. It is emphasized that first, with the qi pulse of the Hand Taiyin, the standard qi of the four seasons should be established, and then the extraordinary and consistent qi measured. The separate discussion of the meridians says: the lung governs the hundred pulses; it also states that the qi pulse forms the inch, which decides life and death. Observing in conjunction with numerical theories, it is evident that the inch pulse corresponds to the Hand Taiyin and thus represents the great meeting point of the pulses. This reflects the inquiry of the Yue people, which is why the inch pulse is uniquely emphasized, establishing it as a reliable method for future generations. Placing it at the beginning of this text opens the first principle; scholars should study it in detail.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>When a person exhales, the pulse travels three inches; when they inhale, the pulse travels three inches. With the breathing settled, the pulse travels six inches. Over a period of one day and night, there are a total of 13,500 breaths, and the pulse travels fifty degrees, circulating around the body, leaking a hundred moments. The flow of nourishment and defense moves twenty-five degrees in yang and twenty-five degrees in yin, completing one cycle. Therefore, the fifty degrees converge at the inch pulse of the hand Taiyin, which is where the internal organs begin and end, thus the method is taken from the inch pulse.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: Referring to the above, this concerns a healthy person without illness who has regular breath counts. Exhalation relates to the output of qi, which is yang; inhalation relates to the intake of qi, which is yin. According to the Huainanjing&#39;s theory on healthy qi: with each exhalation, the pulse moves again, and with each inhalation, the pulse moves again, and when breathing settles, the pulse moves five times. Adding the great breath, this is termed a healthy person. Thus, when a healthy person exhales, the pulse moves three inches; when they inhale, the pulse moves three inches, and with settled breathing, the pulse moves six inches. Considering the number of breaths, there are a total of 13,500 breaths in one day and night; considering the movement of the pulse, it travels fifty degrees around the body. The flow of nourishment and defense in yang is twenty-five degrees, and in yin, also twenty-five degrees. The interaction between yin and yang is reciprocal and uninterrupted, completing fifty degrees, akin to the leaking of a hundred moments, marking one unit of time, and at dawn the next day, it again converges at the hand Taiyin.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>This inch pulse is the beginning and end of the five organs and six bowels, and the law of observation derives from this. It is understood that nourishment and protection begin in the middle burner, with the hand Taiyin channel noted, followed by the Yangming channel which connects to the foot Yangming and Taiyin, continuing to the hand Shaoyin and Taiyang, with the Taiyang flowing to the foot Taiyang and Shaoyin, and the Shaoyin moving to the hand Xin (Heart) and Shaoyang, culminating at the foot Shaoyang and Jueyin. </p>
<p>Counting the breaths as two hundred seventy per cycle, the pulse travels sixteen zhang and two chi, while two moments constitute one full body cycle. This process returns to the hand Taiyin, accumulating and filling it. A person’s inhalation and exhalation count as one breath; there are one hundred thirty-five breaths per moment, eight moments per hour yielding one thousand eighty breaths, and twelve hours plus ninety-six moments totals twelve thousand nine hundred sixty breaths. Dividing the excess results in five hundred forty breaths, combining to form thirteen thousand five hundred breaths.</p>
<p>One breath corresponds to a six-inch pulse movement, with two moments equating to two hundred seventy breaths, which again covers the journey of sixteen zhang and two chi per hour. This means that during eight moments, the pulse moves sixty-four zhang and eight chi, nourishing and protecting the body all around. </p>
<p>In twelve hours, accounting for ninety-six moments, the pulse travels seven hundred seventy-seven zhang and six chi, resulting in forty-eight full body cycles. Dividing the excess results in two extra body cycles, totaling thirty-two zhang and four chi. Overall, this is fifty full body measurements with the pulse reaching eight hundred ten zhang. </p>
<p>This encompasses the breaths, pulse counts, and body measurements, providing a detailed account of the hundred moments of day and night, distinguishing between the movement of Yang and Yin, representing the movement of day and night.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The Second Difficulty states: The pulse has dimensions, what does this mean? Indeed, the dimensions refer to the major significance of the pulse. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: &quot;According to the &#39;Shuo Wen,&#39; the &#39;chi&#39; (尺) is a unit of measure equal to ten &#39;cun&#39; (寸). In the human hand, the pulse is measured at a ten-fold radius as &#39;cun,&#39; where ten cun make up one chi; this is a regulation measurement. In ancient times, units like chi, cun, zhi, xun, chang, and ren were all based on the human body, thus the characters combine the body and a single unit, representing the shape of fingers. &#39;Cun&#39; means ten parts. In the human hand, the pulse at one cun is referred to as &#39;cun kou,&#39; and as noted in the &#39;Shuo Wen,&#39; it illustrates the dimensions of the pulse within the human body. </p>
<p>The chi represents the yin division while the cun represents the yang division. Every meridian, organ, and bodily system operates by yin and yang, whether excessive or deficient, reflected in their measurements, thus underscoring the major significance of the pulse. One might say that &#39;cun kou&#39; is of great importance to the pulse, as it pertains to the lungs in relation to all pulses. This refers to dimensions as being of substantial significance concerning the interaction of yin and yang. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, the meridian of the Taiyin travels from the middle jiao and extends all the way to the tip of both thumbs. The area near the fish joints stretches a length of one cun and nine fen, commonly referred to as &#39;cun kou.&#39; Within this one cun and nine fen, terms like chi and cun are significant and are contained within those measurements.]<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>From the &quot;Guan&quot; to the &quot;Chi,&quot; it is within the &quot;Chi,&quot; governed by Yin; from the &quot;Guan&quot; to the &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; it is within the &quot;Cun Kou,&quot; governed by Yang. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The &quot;Guan&quot; is the boundary between the high bone at the back of the palm and the two regions of Yin and Yang, between the &quot;Cun&quot; and &quot;Chi.&quot; From the &quot;Guan&quot; to the &quot;Chi Ze&quot; is called the &quot;Chi,&quot; and within the Chi, it is governed by Yin. From the &quot;Guan&quot; to the &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; which is the &quot;Cun Kou,&quot; within the &quot;Cun Kou,&quot; it is governed by Yang. Therefore, Sun Simiao said: From the horizontal line between the elbow and wrist to the back of the palm at the &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; it is measured as ten parts, and one takes nine parts to define the &quot;Chi.&quot; </p>
<p>[This nine parts refers to the distance from the elbow and wrist to the &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; representing one &quot;Chi.&quot; Ten parts represent ten &quot;Cun,&quot; and taking one-ninth of an inch in this context denotes the position of the pulse related to the &quot;Chi.&quot; From &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; measuring back and taking one-tenth yields the &quot;Cun,&quot; </p>
<p>[This character &quot;Cun&quot; is not the same as the &quot;Cun&quot; associated with &quot;Guan&quot; and &quot;Chi,&quot; rather it is measured from the horizontal line between the elbow and wrist to the &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; taking one-tenth, representing one &quot;Cun.&quot; Thus, from this one &quot;Cun,&quot; taking nine parts defines the pulse &quot;Cun Kou.&quot; Hence it is said: &quot;Cun is one-tenth, taking nine parts within is the &#39;Cun Kou.&quot;]</p>
<p>Thus, dividing the &quot;Cun&quot; into &quot;Chi&quot; and dividing the &quot;Chi&quot; into &quot;Cun.&quot; </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: &quot;Cun&quot; is Yang, &quot;Chi&quot; is Yin, with Yang above and Yin below. The &quot;Cun&quot; is below the &quot;Chi,&quot; while the &quot;Chi&quot; is above the &quot;Cun,&quot; and the &quot;Guan&quot; serves as the boundary. Dividing &quot;Cun&quot; into &quot;Chi&quot; and &quot;Chi&quot; into &quot;Cun,&quot; is this correct? </p>
<p>[From the &quot;Yu Ji&quot; point, one inch further divides into &quot;Chi,&quot; and from the &quot;Chi Ze&quot; point, one foot before it divides into &quot;Cun.&quot;]<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Thus, in the Yin, one inch is obtained within a foot, and in the Yang, nine parts within an inch.<br>[Huashou says: The number of the old Yin concludes at ten, hence Yin obtains one inch within a foot; this foot refers to the measurement from the fish-root to the foot-pond, totaling ten inches. The number of the old Yang stops at nine, hence Yang obtains nine parts within an inch. This inch refers to the length measured by a person&#39;s width of a hand. ]<br>The dimensions conclude at one inch and nine parts, thus it is called dimensions.<br>[Huashou says: The inch is the beginning of the foot, while the foot is the end of the inch. The term dimensions indicates a relationship of beginning and end, indeed reflecting accumulation. The inch has nine parts, and the foot has one inch, all together representing the fullness of Yin and Yang. Pang Anchang often said: The people of Yue take the hand of the Taiyin and measure an inch and nine parts behind the fish-root to align with the numbers of Yin and Yang. This refers to that. ]<br>The third difficulty states: There are excessive and insufficient pulses, there are Yin and Yang multiplying, there are returning and overflowing, there are closing and blocking; what does this mean?<br>[Huashou says: Excess and insufficiency refer to pathological pulses; closing and blocking, to fatal pulses. The discussion on closing and blocking is found in the &quot;Suwen&quot; on the six stages of visceral representation, and in the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; chapters nine and forty-nine, all emphasizing the qi mouth and human greeting, where the Yang pathways are determined by the human greeting, and the Yin pathways by the qi mouth. Now the people of Yue refer to closing before and after, regarding the inch as Yang and the foot as Yin.]<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Indeed. The pulse before the guan is the movement of yang; the pulse should be seen as nine parts and floating. If it exceeds, it is called &quot;too much&quot;; if it is insufficient, it is called &quot;not enough.&quot; </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The guan before is the position of the floating yang pulse, recognized as nine parts. The number nine signifies yang. The position of the cun is the floating yang pulse, which is its normal state. &quot;Too much&quot; refers to exceeding the basic position and normal pulse. &quot;Not enough&quot; refers to not reaching the basic position and normal pulse; both are pathological pulses.]</p>
<p>Then, the water is seen as overflowing, while the outer guan is internally blocked; this is the pulse of yin riding yang.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: &quot;Then&quot; refers to a direct path that goes straight forward. The Xie family indicates that &quot;then&quot; means moving directly up and down, without any circular movement, which is profound! The text states: When yin qi is excessively strong, yang qi cannot engage with it; since yang qi cannot engage with yin, the yin rises and overflows at the fish border, resulting in the outer guan being internally blocked. The outer guan being internally blocked means that yang is closed off and does not descend, while yin rises to block it. This is the pulse of yin riding on the position of yang.]<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Regarding the latter, after the guan (关), it is the movement of Yin, and the pulse should be seen one inch and deep. For excess, it is called &quot;too much,&quot; and for deficiency, it is called &quot;not sufficient.&quot; </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: After the guan is where the Yin chi pulse moves, with the pulse appearing one inch and deep. One inch is the number of Yin. The position of the chi is a deep Yin pulse, which is its norm. &quot;Too much&quot; refers to exceeding the baseline position or the normal pulse. &quot;Not sufficient&quot; refers to falling short of the baseline position or the normal pulse; both are indicative of pathological pulses.]</p>
<p>Then it enters the chi (尺) as &quot;overturning,&quot; creating an internal barrier against the external, this is the pulse of Yang riding over. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The classic states that when Yang qi is overly strong, Yin qi cannot nourish it. As Yin qi fails to nourish the Yang, Yang descends and reverts to the division of chi, forming an internal barrier against the external. This internal barrier means that Yin is closed within and unable to ascend, while Yang enters from the outside to obstruct it; this is the pulse of Yang occupying the Yin position.]</p>
<p>Thus, it is said: overturning and overflowing. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: &quot;Overturning&quot; refers to how an object tips from above to below; &quot;overflowing&quot; refers to how water spills out from within to the outside.]<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>This is the true pulse of the organ; one may die without being ill. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The pulse of overflow signifies solitary yin and solitary yang, with the upper and lower regions being separate. Thus, it is called the true pulse of the organ, referring to the absence of stomach qi for balance. If a person possesses this pulse, even without illness, they are still doomed to die. This text discusses the extremes of yin and yang; although it denotes a diseased pulse, it does not yet signal imminent danger. If one were to proceed with excessive input and engage in overflow, then it becomes a dead pulse. The character &#39;sui&#39; (to proceed) is particularly crucial, as it connects the preceding and following essential points. Otherwise, the extremes of yin and yang, the interaction and overflow, become a single concept, with no distinctions or priorities. </p>
<p>Some might question the differences in the discussion of yin and yang between this text and the twenty chapters. It is said that this chapter represents the ultimate manifestation of yin and yang interacting as overflow, whereas the twenty chapters depict the further interaction of yin and yang in a concealed manner. The character &#39;geng&#39; (to change) is distinctly different from &#39;sui&#39;; &#39;geng&#39; indicates mutual interaction, while &#39;sui&#39; suggests direct progression. Moreover, overflow and concealment cannot be conflated, as overflow signifies a dead pulse, while concealment indicates a diseased pulse, hence they should not be discussed together. </p>
<p>The first three chapters of this book represent the fundamental teachings of the Yue people. The first difficulty is articulating the pulse at the wrist, encompassing both yin and yang as they relate to the measurement. The second difficulty is discussing sizes, with yin and yang presented in relation to each other throughout the measurement. The third difficulty pertains to overflow, using yin and yang as the framework for understanding, emphasized particularly in the context of measurement as a crucial focal point. Observed as a whole, the meanings of these three components are complete. The first two difficulties address the constancy of yin and yang, while the third addresses the variability of yin and yang.]<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The Four Difficulties state: What is meant by the methods of yin and yang in the pulse? Indeed. Breathing out involves the heart and lungs, while breathing in involves the kidneys and liver. Between these breaths, the spleen receives the flavor of grains, which is found within the pulse.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: Breathing out is yang, breathing in is yin; the heart and lungs represent yang, while the kidneys and liver represent yin, each responding according to their respective positions of high and low. With each exhale, the heart and lungs take charge, and with each inhale, the kidneys and liver govern. The rhythm of breathing stabilizes to cause five movements in the pulse, enriched by the great breath, which relates to the spleen. Thus, it is said, &quot;Between the breaths, the spleen receives the flavor of grains, which is within the pulse.&quot; This &quot;within&quot; refers to being in the midst of yin and yang breathing. Why so? Because the spleen receives the flavor of grains and nourishes the internal organs; all organs receive qi from the spleen, which signifies the role of the central palace.]</p>
<p>Floating represents yang, while sinking represents yin; hence it is called yin and yang.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: Floating represents yang, and sinking represents yin; this corresponds to the explanation from the previous text leading into the next.]<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>When both the heart and lungs are floating, how can they be distinguished? Indeed, the floating and widely spread pulse indicates the heart, while the floating and short pulse indicates the lungs. When both the kidneys and liver are sinking, how can they be distinguished? Yes, the firm and long pulse indicates the liver; the moist pulse, which feels solid when lifted, indicates the kidneys. The spleen is the center of the body, therefore its pulse is found in the middle, reflecting the principle of yin and yang.</p>
<p>Hua Shou said: the heart and lungs are floating yet distinct; the heart is the supreme yang, hence its pulse is floating and widely spread; the lungs are the yin within yang, thus its pulse is floating and short. The kidneys and liver are sinking yet distinct; the liver is the yang within yin, so its pulse is firm and long; the kidneys are the yin within yin, leading to a moist pulse that feels solid when lifted. The ancient scholar Yuan noted that the kidneys belong to the water pulse, showing exterior softness yet inner firmness, embodying the essence of water. The explanation of the spleen is as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Pulses may have one yin and one yang, one yin and two yang, or one yin and three yang; conversely, there may be one yang and one yin, one yang and two yin, or one yang and three yin. Is it possible that at the cun position all six pulses are present? Indeed, this does not mean all six pulses are active, but refers to the characteristics of floating, sinking, long, short, slippery, and wiry. Floating signifies yang, slippery also signifies yang, and long signifies yang; while sinking signifies yin, short signifies yin, and wiry signifies yin. The term one yin and one yang describes a pulse that is sinking yet slippery; one yin and two yang refers to a pulse that is sinking, slippery, and long; one yin and three yang describes a pulse that is floating, slippery, and long, sometimes sinking.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The mention of one yang and one yin refers to a pulse that is superficial and thin; one yang and two yin refers to a pulse that is long and deep; one yang and three yin refers to a pulse that is deep, thin, and sometimes superficial. Each is named according to its corresponding meridian, indicating the condition of the illness as either contrary or in accordance. </p>
<p>Hua Shou said: The inquiry and answers clarify that the yin and yang pulses observed in the three regions are not simply singular. Because they are not singular, there are these six pulses coexisting: a floating pulse is felt lightly, a long pulse is excessive in its original position, and a slippery pulse flows smoothly—all of which are yang pulses; a deep pulse is felt heavily, a short pulse fails to reach its original position, and a thin pulse stagnates in its flow—all of which are yin pulses. Because they coexist, there are instances of one yin and one yang, as well as one yang and one yin, illustrating their variability. Thus, where the pulse travels indicates the location of the illness; correlating the pulse with the illness and the organs, some are appropriate while others are not, resonating or not corresponding with the four seasons, which indicates the contrary or in accordance nature of the illness.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The Five Difficulties state: Regarding the pulse&#39;s lightness and heaviness, what does this mean? Indeed. Initially, when feeling the pulse, if it is as heavy as three beans, it corresponds to the lungs; if as heavy as six beans, it corresponds to the heart; if as heavy as nine beans, it corresponds to the spleen; if as heavy as twelve beans, it corresponds to the liver; and if pressing until the bone, and lifting the fingers swiftly, it corresponds to the kidneys. Thus, it is said to be light and heavy.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The lungs are most prominent, governing the skin and hair; therefore, their pulse is like the weight of three beans. The heart is below the lungs, governing the blood vessels; hence, its pulse is like the weight of six beans. The spleen is below the heart, governing the muscles; thus, its pulse is like the weight of nine beans. The liver is below the spleen, governing the tendons; therefore, its pulse is like the weight of twelve beans. The kidneys are below the liver, governing the bones; hence, their pulse, when pressing until the bone, causes the fingers to lift quickly.]<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The kidneys do not verbally express their principles, but one could deduce their nature by analogy, as it would be like the weight of fifteen beans. Now, when we apply this method to express weight, it would correspond to the notion of floating and sinking. However, there is no mention of this in the “Pivot” or “Essence” texts. Is it passed down from the ancient pulse methods or is it an insight gained by the Yue people themselves?</p>
<p>The Xie family of Luling states: In the measurements of the cun (寸) and ge (尺) pulse positions, each organ has its specific loci, and within each section, the pulse itself also has variation in weight. For instance, as the Yushi of Lingyang pointed out: If the left wrist&#39;s cun feels like the weight of three beans, that indicates the influx of lung qi; if it feels like six beans, it indicates the flow of the fundamental meridian, and one should similarly infer for the rest. Thus, one understands that the energies of the five organs interpenetrate each other, and the six pulses consequently provide a standard, which can determine auspiciousness or illness. The same applies to other pulse positions, like the examples of the ten difficulties and their variations.</p>
<p>The sixth difficulty states: The pulse may present with an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang or an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. What does this mean? Indeed, when the floating pulse is diminished, it indicates lightness; when the sinking pulse is solid, it indicates heaviness, thus illustrating an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; conversely, when the sinking pulse is diminished and the floating pulse is solid, this indicates an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. This is the essence of the concepts of yin, yang, deficiency, and fullness. </p>
<p>Hua Shou remarks: The terms floating and sinking refer to weight, while excess and deficiency are described in terms of yin and yang balancing. A light touch reveals less, while a heavy touch shows more, indicating an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; conversely, a heavy touch reveals less, while a light touch shows more, indicating an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. Generally, a light touch reveals the yang aspect, while a heavy touch reveals the yin aspect, regardless of the specific location; this principle serves as the basis for further deductions.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The Seven Difficulties states: The Classic mentions the arrival of lesser yang as sometimes large and sometimes small, sometimes short and sometimes long; the arrival of yang brightness as floating and large yet short; the arrival of greater yang as vast and long; the arrival of greater yin as tight and long; the arrival of lesser yin as tight, fine, and subtle; and the arrival of ultimate yin as heavy, short, and solid. Are these six disturbances of a balanced pulse or indicative of an illness? They are all royal pulses. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: The six royal pulses are explained below.]</p>
<p>By which month does each reign and for how many days? After the winter solstice, one encounters the royal pulse of lesser yang on the day of the first heavenly stem, followed by the royal pulse of yang brightness, then greater yang, then greater yin, then lesser yin, and finally ultimate yin, each lasting sixty days. In total, six pulses of six days yield three hundred sixty days, completing a year. This is the essential timing of the three yang and three yin. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: The previous text speaks of the royal pulses of the three yang and three yin; this speaks of their timing, and one will see their pulses when the time arrives. According to historical texts, this corresponds to the ancient November at the start of the month, with winter solstice as the origin for the calendar, meant to align with the division of atmospheric phenomena at the new moon.]<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The movement of celestial cycles, along with the paths of the sun and moon, varies in speed; years differ among themselves, as spoken of by the people of Yue regarding the first cycle after the winter solstice. Thus, the irregularity of seasonal changes and the timing of natural phenomena cannot remain constant. Therefore, Ding&#39;s commentary states that the first cycle after the winter solstice can occur either at the beginning of minor cold or after major cold; the arrival of lesser yang begins here, followed by the other phases in order. Ji&#39;s commentary also states that from the day of the winter solstice, the first yang is born. Thus, the first cycle after the winter solstice represents the true king of lesser yang. If we trace its origin, based on the common practices of combining the first cycle with the winter solstice, then the king of lesser yang should indeed begin from this day, continuing through the middle of the first month, followed by the other phases in succession. When lesser yang arrives, the yang energy is still weak, which is why its pulse fluctuates in size—it varies between being large and small, and between being short and long. When greater yang arrives, there remains some yin, which is why its pulse is superficial, large, and short. When the supreme yang arrives, the yang is abundant and at its peak, hence its pulse becomes vigorous, large, and long.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>When yang reaches its peak, it transforms into yin; thus, after the summer solstice is the beginning of the use of the three yin. When taiyin arises, the yin qi begins to rise subtly, hence its pulse is tight, large, and long. When shaoyin arises, the yin gradually becomes stronger, thus its pulse is tight, fine, and subtle. When jueyin arises, the yin is at its fullest, hence its pulse is deep, short, and firm. When yin reaches its peak, it transforms back into yang, marking the beginning of the use of the three yang. This is the royal pulse of the three yangs and three yins, which corresponds to the six manifestations and follows the four seasons, moving from subtle to distinct, advancing from gradual to extreme, each in its proper order. Yuan comments: Spring is warm, summer is hot; autumn is cool, winter is cold. Thus, the six pulses in humans also follow the variations of yin and yang through the seasons, continually changing and shifting.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>Liu Wenshu said: According to the &quot;Essential Discussions of Ultimate Truth,&quot; the pulse of the Liver (Jueyin) is string-like, the pulse of the Heart (Shaoyin) is hook-like, the pulse of the Spleen (Taiyin) is deep, the pulse of the Gallbladder (Shaoyang) is large and superficial, the pulse of the Stomach (Yangming) is short and slippery, and the pulse of the Bladder (Taiyang) is large and long. These also correspond to the movements of the qi of heaven and earth. For example, in spring, the pulse is string-like; in summer, it is torrential; in autumn, it is fine; and in winter, it is solid. Thus, the five phases and six qi, along with the four seasons, all correspond to these pulses. </p>
<p>If a layperson examines the phenomena, they may find the pulse of the Bladder to be torrential, large, and long, the pulse of the Gallbladder to fluctuate between sparse and dense, sometimes short and sometimes long, and the pulse of the Stomach to be superficial, large, and short. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; references these to discuss the pulses of the three Yin and three Yang, indicating the depth and shallowness at which Yin and Yang are generated.</p>
<p>The beginning of the text refers to the words of the classics, yet upon examination, there is nothing found in the &quot;Pivot&quot; or &quot;Substance.&quot; Although a layperson&#39;s observations have some explanations, they lack detail. Could it be that the ancients had a different interpretation of ancient texts? Perhaps the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; contains this knowledge, but later generations lost the original writings? This is unknown. Hence, any statements regarding the classics that lack examination are fundamentally based on this principle.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The Eight Difficulties state: If the pulse at the cun position is flat and one dies, what does this mean? Indeed, all twelve meridians are connected to the source of vital energy. The so-called source of vital energy refers to the roots of the twelve meridians, which lie in the movement of energy within the kidneys. This is the foundation of the five organs and six bowels, the root of the twelve meridians, the gate of inhalation and exhalation, and the origin of the triple burner, also known as the spirit that guards against pathogens. Therefore, vital energy is the essence of life; if it is cut off, the branches and leaves wither. If the pulse at the cun position is flat and one dies, it indicates that vital energy has been completely severed internally.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The movement of energy within the kidneys is the vital energy that people receive from heaven for life. The kidneys are the water of the child, positioned within Kan, representing the northern hexagram. They are the numerical singularity of heaven and precede fire, wood, metal, and earth, hence serving as the source of vital energy, the root of all meridians, and the spirit that guards against pathogens. When the original vital energy is strong, pathogens cannot invade. When the original vital energy is lost, one dies like a tree, with its roots severed and branches and leaves withered. Thus, if the pulse at the cun position is flat and one dies, it signifies that the vital energy has been exclusively severed internally.]</p>
<p>[This passage and the discussion in the first difficulty may seem contradictory, yet each has its own focus. The first difficulty states that death can be determined by the cun pulse, meaning the cun is a major point for assessing life and death, where changes in the qi can be observed. This passage discusses original qi; when a person&#39;s original qi is abundant, they live, and when original qi is depleted, even if the cun pulse is flat, one still dies. Original qi refers to its essence, while food qi refers to its function.]<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>The Nine Difficulties state: How can we distinguish the diseases of the viscera and bowels? Indeed, the rapid pulse indicates the bowels, while the slow pulse indicates the viscera. A rapid pulse suggests heat, whereas a slow pulse suggests cold. All yang-related conditions indicate heat, and all yin-related conditions indicate cold. Thus, we can differentiate the diseases of the viscera and bowels.</p>
<p>【Hua Shou said: In general, for a person&#39;s pulse, one inhalation and one exhalation constitute one breath. Within one breath, the pulse beats four times; if extended, it beats five times, and this is called the pulse of a healthy person. A healthy person has a stable pulse; any increase or decrease indicates illness. Therefore, if there are three beats in one breath, it is called slow, indicative of an insufficient pulse; if there are six beats, it is called rapid, indicative of an excessive pulse. The viscera are yin, and the bowels are yang. A rapid pulse is associated with the bowels, indicating yang and heat; a slow pulse is associated with the viscera, indicating yin and cold. This principle applies not just to these cases, as all yang pulses signify heat and all yin pulses signify cold. The diseases of the viscera and bowels are differentiated based on these principles.】<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The &quot;Ten Difficulties&quot; states: What does it mean that a single pulse manifests as ten variations? It is so. The five evils represent the interplay of hardness and softness. For example, if the heart pulse is very rapid, it suggests that liver evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly rapid, it indicates that gallbladder evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is very strong, it means heart evil is affecting the heart itself; if the heart pulse is slightly strong, it implies that small intestine evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is extremely slow, it suggests spleen evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly slow, it indicates that stomach evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is very thin, it suggests lung evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly thin, it means large intestine evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is very deep, it indicates kidney evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly deep, it suggests bladder evil is affecting the small intestine. Each of the five organs has its corresponding hardness and softness evils, thus a single pulse can seemingly transform into ten variations.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The five evils refer to the qi of the five organs and five bowels that have deviated from their proper state and become evil. Hardness and softness denote yang as hardness and yin as softness. The interplay of hardness and softness means that organs intersect with organs, and bowels intersect with bowels. Each of the five organs and five bowels has five evils; thus, for those pulses that are very strong, they belong to the organs, while those that are weak belong to the bowels. This is particularly exemplified with the heart, and the others can be inferred by analogy, hence it is said that a single pulse can transform into ten variations.]<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>The Eleventh Difficulty states: The classics say that when the pulse does not reach fifty beats and then one stops, which organ lacks energy? Indeed. When a person inhales, it enters with Yin, and when they exhale, it arises with Yang. Now, if the inhalation cannot reach the kidneys and only reaches the liver before returning, it is known that the organ lacking energy is the kidneys, as their energy is depleted first.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: In the fifth chapter of &quot;The Spirit Pivot,&quot; it is mentioned that a person takes in energy fifty times a day and night to nourish the essence of the five organs. If this number is not achieved, it is called a mad living. The so-called fifty times means that each of the five organs receives energy, and one counts their pulse at each intake. If there are fifty beats without a replacement, it means all five organs receive energy; if there are forty beats with one replacement, one organ lacks energy; if there are thirty beats with one replacement, two organs lack energy; if there are twenty beats with one replacement, three organs lack energy; if there are ten beats with one replacement, four organs lack energy; and if there are fewer than ten beats with one replacement, all five organs lack energy, leading to a short lifespan. The kidneys are located at the lowest point among the five organs, and inhalation is the furthest; thus, if there are fifty beats but one stops, it indicates that the kidneys lack support, and their energy should be depleted first. Depletion indicates deficiency, and when deficient, it cannot support the qi of the other organs upward.]<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The Twelve Difficulties states: The classics say that when the pulses of the five organs are severed internally, the practitioner needles externally; when the pulses of the five organs are severed externally, the practitioner needles internally. How can one distinguish between the severing of inside and outside? Indeed, when the pulses of the five organs are severed internally, the qi of the kidneys and liver has also been severed within, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the heart and lungs; when the pulses of the five organs are severed externally, the pulses of the heart and lungs have also been severed outside, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the kidneys and liver. Supplementing yang for the deficiency of yin and supplementing yin for the deficiency of yang is what is called truly supporting and truly depleting, diminishing the insufficient and augmenting the abundant. In such cases, the dead person is killed by the physician.</p>
<p>Hua Shou states: In the first chapter of the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; it is said that before using needles, one must first diagnose the pulses and observe the severity of the condition to treat it appropriately. In the third chapter, it states that when the qi of the five organs is severed internally, the pulse&#39;s qi cannot reach inward, yet one takes the external area of disease, connecting to the yang vessels, leaving needles to draw forth yang qi; when the yang qi arrives, the internal heavy supply is depleted, and when depleted, death occurs, for there is no qi to move, hence it lies still. When the qi of the five organs is severed externally, the pulse&#39;s qi cannot reach outward, yet one takes the channels of the four extremities, leaving needles to draw forth yin qi; when the yin qi arrives, the yang qi reverses and enters, and upon entering, this reversal leads to death, for the excess of yin qi results in agitation. This distinction of pulses, internal and external, speaks to yin and yang. The people of Yue differentiate inside and outside of heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver to explain yin and yang by this principle. The Ji family suggests that this chapter discusses needling techniques, while Feng Jie states that this chapter corresponds to methods of supplementing and depleting with needles; it should be placed after the sixty difficulties as examples follow one another.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The Thirteenth Difficulty states: The Classic says that if one sees a color but cannot feel the pulse, or if one finds a pulse that is antagonistic, that is death; if one finds a pulse that is supportive, the illness will cease on its own. The color and the pulse should correspond with each other; how is this to be dealt with?</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: In the fourth chapter of &quot;Lingshu,&quot; it states that to see the color and understand the illness is called &#39;ming&#39;; to feel the pulse and know the illness is called &#39;shen&#39;; to inquire about the illness and know the location is called &#39;gong.&#39; The color, pulse, shape, and flesh should not be divorced from each other. If the color is blue, the pulse should be taut; if red, the pulse should be hooked; if yellow, the pulse should be regular; if white, the pulse should be short; and if black, the pulse should be heavy. If one sees the color but cannot feel the pulse, it means the color and pulse do not match. When the color and pulse do not match, what pulse can one rely on? If one finds an antagonistic pulse, that means death; if one finds a supportive pulse, the illness will cease. &#39;Cease&#39; means to heal or to combine.]</p>
<p>Indeed, the five organs have five colors, all visible on the face, and they should correspond with what is felt at the wrist and within the body. For instance, if the color is blue, the pulse should be taut and rapid; if red, the pulse should be floating, large, and scattered; if yellow, the pulse should be moderate and large; if white, the pulse should be floating, weak, and short; if black, the pulse should be heavy and slippery. This is what is meant by the correspondence of the five colors and their pulses.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The correspondence between color and pulse should be understood in this way, enabling one to perceive both the color and the pulse.]<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The pulse is rapid; the skin on the wrist is also rapid. The pulse is slow; the skin on the wrist is also slow. The pulse is thin; the skin on the wrist is also thin. The pulse is slippery; the skin on the wrist is also slippery. The pulse is choppy; the skin on the wrist is also choppy. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; in the fourth chapter, the Yellow Emperor asks, &quot;Once the color and pulse are determined, how do we differentiate them?&quot; Qibo replies, &quot;By adjusting the pulse’s rapidity, size, slipperiness, and choppiness, as well as the firmness or tenderness of the flesh, the nature of the illness can be determined.&quot; The Yellow Emperor then asks, &quot;How should we adjust it?&quot; Qibo answers, &quot;If the pulse is rapid, the skin on the wrist is also rapid; if the pulse is slow, the skin is also slow; if the pulse is small, the skin on the wrist is also diminished; if the pulse is large, the skin is also raised; if the pulse is slippery, the skin is also slippery; if the pulse is choppy, the skin is also choppy.&quot; </p>
<p>All these changes vary in intensity; therefore, a good practitioner of the wrist pulse does not rely solely on the finger. A skilled pulse diagnostician does not depend only on color. Those who can combine and apply their knowledge can be considered master practitioners. Master practitioners achieve results ten out of ten; those who grasp two aspects are competent practitioners, achieving eight out of ten; those who comprehend one aspect are lesser practitioners, achieving six out of ten.</p>
<p>This aligns with what was said earlier about the harmony of color, pulse, and flesh.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>The five organs each have their own sounds, colors, odors, and tastes, which should correspond with the pulse at the wrist. If they do not correspond, it indicates illness. For example, if the color is green and the pulse is floating, weak, and short, it is as if it is large and slow, signifying a defeat; if the pulse is floating, large, and scattered, it is as if it is small and slippery, signifying a generation. </p>
<p>Hua Shou says: &quot;When discussing these things, it&#39;s about relationships. Taking the color green as an example helps to clarify mutual defeat and generation. The color green corresponds to the liver, and a floating, weak, and short pulse indicates the lung pulse, where metal overcomes wood. A large and slow pulse indicates the spleen pulse, where wood overcomes earth; this is mutual defeat. A floating, large, and scattered pulse indicates the heart pulse, where wood generates fire. A small and slippery pulse indicates the kidney pulse, where water generates wood; this is mutual generation. The so-called pulse of mutual defeat indicates death, while the pulse of mutual generation indicates the illness will resolve itself.&quot;<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The text discusses the distinctions between different levels of skill in diagnosing through pulse and other signs, categorizing practitioners into three types: lower-level (下工), middle-level (中工), and upper-level (上工). The upper-level practitioner is accurate nine out of ten times, the middle-level practitioner eight out of ten, and the lower-level practitioner six out of ten. </p>
<p>It then addresses the nature of pulse diagnosis, explaining that when one observes the pulse, there are particular signs to look for. The discussion highlights that the visual signs, pulse, and skin must not be considered in isolation; they must correlate with the sounds, colors, smells, and tastes corresponding to the internal organs, and these observations must also correlate with one’s overall knowledge and skill.</p>
<p>In the following section, the “Fourteen Difficulties” mention different conditions of the pulse. It defines the term &quot;至&quot; (arriving) for a pulse that is steady (平), which is characterized by a rhythm that repeats every two breaths. If it deviates from this pattern, it is considered &quot;离经&quot; (deviation from the normal), and more severe conditions progress into &quot;夺精&quot; (loss of essence) and &quot;死&quot; (death).</p>
<p>In summary, the distinctions in pulse signify varying health states and levels of expertise in diagnosis, with a particular focus on the need for comprehensive knowledge of the body’s signs.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>The &quot;Zhi pulse&quot; rises from below and goes upward, from the kidney to the lung; the &quot;Sun pulse&quot; travels downward, from the lung to the kidney. Xie said: In a healthy person, with each breath, the pulse arrives twice and travels three inches; now, with one breath, it arrives three times, and the pulse travels four and a half inches. In one breath, it travels nine inches, and in twenty breaths, it covers one hundred and eighty zhang, surpassing the healthy person&#39;s pace of over sixty zhang. This is the deviation of the &quot;Zhi pulse.&quot; For a healthy person, with one breath, the pulse arrives twice and travels three inches; if now with one breath it arrives only once, it only travels one and a half inches. In twenty breaths, the pulse moves slowly and travels sixty zhang; this is the deviation of the &quot;Sun pulse.&quot; As for the depletion of essence by the &quot;Zhi pulse,&quot; if it arrives four times with one breath, it travels one foot two inches in that breath. For the depletion of essence by the &quot;Sun pulse,&quot; if it arrives once for every two breaths, it travels three inches in one breath, and the condition worsens. Beyond this, there is death and the ending of the life force.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>What are the illnesses caused by weakening the pulse? First, it weakens the outer skin and hair; the skin thickens while the hair falls out. Second, it weakens the blood vessels; the blood becomes insufficient, failing to nourish the internal organs. Third, it weakens the muscles; the muscles atrophy, and food cannot nourish the skin. Fourth, it weakens the tendons; the tendons become slack and cannot support themselves. Fifth, it weakens the bones; the bones weaken, preventing one from getting out of bed. Conversely, if these conditions are reversed, it leads to the collection of illnesses. If weakness arises from below to above, the weakened bones preventing one from getting out of bed may lead to death; if it arises from above to below, the thickened skin and hair loss may lead to death.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: Regarding the collection of illnesses, it should be considered as the illness of the pulse; the term &quot;collection&quot; is a misunderstanding. The lungs govern the skin and hair, the heart governs the blood vessels, the spleen governs the muscles, the liver governs the tendons, and the kidneys govern the bones, each showing what is weakened in accordance with their governing function. When these are reversed as illnesses of the pulse, weakness of the pulse arises from below to above, and illnesses of the pulse arise from above to below.]<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>What is the method for treating deficiencies? Indeed, to treat a deficiency in the lungs, one should enhance the vital energy; to treat a deficiency in the heart, one should regulate the nourishment and defense; to treat a deficiency in the spleen, one should adjust diet and adapt to the cold and warm; to treat a deficiency in the liver, one should soothe the internal environment; to treat a deficiency in the kidneys, one should enhance the essence. This is the method for treating deficiencies.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The lungs govern vital energy, the heart governs blood vessels, and the kidneys govern essence, each is treated according to its deficiency. The nourishment and defense are dependent on the blood vessels. The spleen governs the digestion of grains, hence, for a deficiency in the spleen, one adjusts the diet and adapts to the cold and warm. In spring and summer, one consumes cool or cold food, while in autumn and winter, one consumes warm or hot food, and clothing and daily activities should align with the seasons. The liver governs blood; if blood is deficient, there is internal insufficiency. It is also said that the liver governs anger, and anger can harm the liver, thus for a deficiency in the liver, one should soothe the internal environment. The scripture states that when the liver is painful and urgent, sweet foods should be consumed to soothe it; &#39;to soothe&#39; means to harmonize.]<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>The pulse may present with one breath followed by another, one inhale followed by another; it can also show one breath followed by three, one inhale followed by three; one breath followed by four, one inhale followed by four; one breath followed by five, one inhale followed by five; one breath followed by six, one inhale followed by six; one breath followed by one, one inhale followed by one; there may also be a repeated breath followed by one and a repeated inhale followed by one; there may be breaths and inhales succeeding one another. If the pulse comes forth in this manner, how can one distinguish its illness? </p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: This repeats the inquiry regarding the pulse of loss and arrival. The previous discussion of loss and arrival pertains to illnesses arising from the internal ailments of the five organs, while this refers to those influenced by evils affecting the meridians, arising from the external. The mention of breaths and inhales succeeding each other indicates one breath followed by one and one inhale followed by one, which seems to be an erroneous addition.]<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Indeed. When the pulse comes once with each breath and returns once, it is neither large nor small, called &quot;even.&quot; When there is one exhalation and three pulses, and one inhalation and three pulses, it indicates a moderate illness. If the pulse is larger at the front and smaller at the back, it results in headaches and dizziness; if smaller in front and larger in back, it leads to fullness in the chest and shortness of breath. When there is one exhalation and four pulses, and one inhalation and four pulses, it signals a worsening condition. A strong and large pulse indicates distress and fullness, while a deep and thin pulse causes abdominal pain. A slippery pulse signifies internal heat, while a rough pulse relates to fog or exposure. When the pulse comes with one exhalation and five pulses, and one inhalation and five pulses, the person is likely exhausted, with a deep and thin pulse worsening at night and a floating and large pulse worsening during the day. If the pulse is neither large nor small, although the person is fatigued, they can be treated. Those with fluctuating sizes are difficult to treat. When there is one exhalation and six pulses, and one inhalation and six pulses, it denotes a pulse leading to death; a deep thin pulse worsens at night, and a floating large pulse worsens during the day. When there is one exhalation and one pulse, and one inhalation and one pulse, it is called &quot;deficient&quot;; although a person can walk, they still feel the need to lie down. This is due to insufficient blood and qi. If there are two exhalations and two pulses, and breathing occurs again, it is termed &quot;no soul&quot;; without a soul, a person is close to death. Even if they can walk, it is called being a living corpse. </p>
<p>[Shuai Shou comments: One breath with four pulses signifies an even pulse. One exhalation and three pulses, and one inhalation and three pulses, indicate that the pulse has increased by two compared to a normal person, hence it is termed a moderate illness, not severe.]<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The text discusses the relationship between pulse characteristics and illness, noting that a large pulse at the front indicates a severe condition, while a thin pulse at the back suggests issues in the lower body. It emphasizes that the pulse is a reflection of bodily health, with various pulse qualities signifying different imbalances. For instance, a slippery pulse indicates heat damage affecting qi without harming blood, while a rough pulse signifies cold damaging the blood. The text elaborates that the pulse&#39;s condition worsens with each breath, with a distinction between daytime (yang) and nighttime (yin) patterns. A pulse that shows significant fluctuation indicates a critical state, categorized as a &quot;dead pulse.&quot; Ultimately, it states that when both blood and qi are deficient, life is at risk, leading to a state of being without spirit and inevitable death.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If the upper part has a pulse and the lower part does not, the person should vomit; if they do not, they will die. If the upper part has no pulse and the lower part has a pulse, although they may feel weak, they will not suffer harm. This is like a person having a ruler and a tree having roots; even if the branches and leaves are withered, the roots will still grow. Since the pulse has a foundation and a person has vital energy, it is known that they will not die. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The analogy should be under the phrase &quot;having a ruler,&quot; as this describes the condition of illness associated with the presence or absence of pulses in the upper and lower parts. Ji Shi said: When the upper part has a pulse and the lower part does not, it signifies that both the evil and the essence are in the upper part, hence they should vomit; if there are no signs of vomiting, it indicates that there is no evil in the upper part and that the lower vital energy is exhausted, thus it is said they will die.]</p>
<p>[Dongyuan Li said: If the lower part has no pulse, this signifies stagnation of wood. Excessive eating fills the chest in the Taiyin area, preventing the spring yang from rising, which is called wood stagnation. When wood stagnation occurs, it needs to be resolved, hence the recommendation to vomit.]<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>The Xie clan says: In the upper part there are no pulses, while in the lower part there are pulses, which indicates that yin energy is strong and yang energy is weak; hence, although one may feel fatigued, it cannot cause harm. The upper part without pulses resembles dry tree branches; the lower part with pulses resembles a tree with roots. Only with roots can one expect life.</p>
<p>The Chen clan of Siming says: &quot;Zhi&quot; means advancement; yang thrives alone and becomes numerous; &quot;Sun&quot; means reduction; yin thrives alone and becomes few. The zhi pulse flows from bottom to top, indicating that without yin, yang moves alone. When it reaches the top, yang is also cut off and dies; the sun pulse flows from top to bottom, indicating that without yang, yin moves alone. When it reaches the bottom, yin is also depleted and dies.</p>
<p>One finds it difficult to interpret the pulse at the wrist to determine the life or death and fortunes of the organs, as the qi at the wrist corresponds to the five organs. One also finds it difficult to describe how the spleen receives the flavor of grains, with its pulse situated in the center, meaning that all five organs are centered around the stomach, whose pulse governs the upper connections. This difficulty in explaining one&#39;s measurements is comparable to a tree having roots; just as the pulse has a base, a person has original qi. Therefore, if one knows one cannot die, it is based on the measurements of the ruler. This is how the Yue people intricately convey their meanings, dispersed across texts, to illustrate that each measure has its appropriate significance.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The fifteenth difficulty states: The classics mention spring is represented by the string, summer by the hook, autumn by the hair, and winter by the stone. Are these the pulse of a ruler or a sick pulse? Indeed. The string, hook, hair, and stone represent the pulses of the four seasons. </p>
<p>Spring, represented by the string, corresponds to the liver in the eastern wood. This is the time when all things begin to grow, and there are no branches or leaves yet; thus, the pulse comes softly and gently, hence it is called the string. </p>
<p>Summer, represented by the hook, corresponds to the heart in the southern fire. This is the time when all things flourish, with hanging branches and sprawling leaves, which bend downward like a hook; therefore, the pulse comes swiftly and goes slowly, hence it is called the hook. </p>
<p>Autumn, represented by the hair, corresponds to the lungs in the western metal. This is the time when all things come to an end, grasses and trees flower and their leaves fall; their branches remain like fine hair, so the pulse comes light and vacuous, hence it is called the hair. </p>
<p>Winter, represented by the stone, corresponds to the kidneys in the northern water. This is the time when all things are hidden; in the harsh winter, water solidifies like stone, so the pulse comes heavy and slippery, hence it is called the stone. These are the pulses of the four seasons. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: This is a compilation of the &quot;Internal Classic&quot; concerning the normal dynamics and the true organs, mixed in its text to form this chapter. The spring pulse as the string pertains to the liver&#39;s control over the tendons, representing the image of tendons. The summer pulse as the hook pertains to the heart&#39;s control over the blood vessels, representing the image of the coming and going of blood vessels. The autumn pulse as the hair pertains to the lungs&#39; control over the skin and hair. The winter pulse as the stone relates to the kidneys&#39; control over the bones. Each corresponds to its imagery, also incorporating the symbolic meaning of seasonal characteristics. The pulse comes swiftly and goes slowly; Liu Lizhi said: The incoming pulse arises from the division of flesh and bone, emerging at the skin&#39;s boundary, rising with Qi; the outgoing pulse retreats from the skin&#39;s boundary back to the division of flesh and bone, descending with Qi.]<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>What if there are changes?</p>
<p>[Huasou says: The pulse reversing is called change in the four seasons.]</p>
<p>Indeed. In spring, a string-like pulse indicates illness when it reverses. What does reversal mean? Indeed. If the qi comes strong and full, it is called too much, with the illness external; if the qi comes weak and vague, it is called insufficient, with the illness internal. If the qi comes sluggish and faint, like following the leaves of the elm, it is called normal; if it is fuller and slippery, like following a long pole, it is called illness; if it is sudden and vigorous, like a newly drawn bowstring, it is called death. A slightly string-like pulse in spring is normal; if it has many strings and little stomach qi, it is illness; but if it has no stomach qi, it is death, for spring is based on stomach qi. </p>
<p>In summer, a hook-like pulse indicates illness when it reverses. What does reversal mean? Indeed. If the qi comes strong and full, it is called too much, with the illness external; if the qi comes weak and vague, it is called insufficient, with the illness internal. If the pulse comes abundant like rings, like following a gem, it is normal; if it comes increased in number, like a chicken lifting its foot, it is illness; if it curves in front and straightens in back, like holding a hook, it is death. A slightly hook-like pulse in summer is normal; if it has many hooks and little stomach qi, it is illness; but if it has no stomach qi, it is death, for summer is based on stomach qi. </p>
<p>In autumn, a hair-like pulse indicates illness when it reverses. What does reversal mean? Indeed.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>When the qi comes strong and substantial, it is called excess, and the illness is external; when the qi comes weak and slight, it is called deficiency, and the illness is internal. The pulse comes gently like a covered cart; pressing it makes it stronger, this is called normal; it remains steady, as if following the feathers of a chicken, this is called illness; it is weak and sparse, like hair blown by the wind, this is called death. In autumn, the pulse is slightly soft and is considered normal; when it is soft with little stomach qi, it is called illness, but when it is soft without stomach qi, it is called death, for in autumn, stomach qi is fundamental. In winter, the pulse is hard; a reversed pulse indicates illness. What is a reverse pulse? Indeed. When the qi comes strong and substantial, it is called excess, and the illness is external; when the qi comes weak and slight, it is called deficiency, and the illness is internal. The pulse appears large above and thin below, slippery and smooth like a bird’s peck, this is called normal; if there are repeated connections in the pecking, with slight bends, this is called illness; if it comes like a released knot and departs like a bouncing stone, this is called death. In winter, a slightly hard pulse is considered normal; when it is hard with little stomach qi, it is called illness, but when it is hard without stomach qi, it is called death, for in winter, stomach qi is fundamental. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: In spring, if the pulse is excessive, it causes forgetfulness and dizziness; if deficient, it causes chest pain and pulling down to the lower back, making the sides tense.]<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>In summer, if the pulse is too strong, it causes the body to feel hot and the skin to hurt as if immersed; if too weak, it leads to restlessness, coughing, and energy leakage. In autumn, if the pulse is too strong, it causes reversal of qi and back pain, resulting in irritation; if too weak, it leads to wheezing, shallow breathing, coughing with blood seen above, and illness detected below. In winter, if the pulse is too strong, it causes discomfort, back pain with shallow speech; if too weak, it makes the heart feel anxious like hunger, causing pain in the lower back and fullness in the lower abdomen, with disturbed urination. This is the teaching of Qibo. The intent of the Yue people seems to be based on this. When discussing the pulse and qi, if the pulse does not move, it is forced by the qi, particularly concerning stomach qi. </p>
<p>In spring, the pulse is affable and gentle, like running fingers over elm leaves, firm yet harmonious; it is full and slippery, like gliding along a long pole, with more tension; it is rapid and strong, like a newly drawn bowstring, yet nothing more than a string. In summer, the pulse is intertwined like rings, smooth like running over agate, with hooks that harmonize; akin to a chicken lifting its foot, it has many hooks and strength; it curves in the front and settles in the back, firm upon pressing and solid on probing, yet simply a hook.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Autumn pulses are abundant like a cart cover, pressing them enhances the sensation, they feel fine; neither rising nor falling, like feeling chicken feathers, with many fine hairs; pressing them feels sparse, like hair blown by the wind, merely hair. Winter pulses are large above and smooth below, both sizes are balanced, solid yet harmonious; the up and down share the same essence, as discussed in the previous chapter; they connect in a pecking manner, slightly curved, with much solidity; coming like untangling a knot, going like flicking a stone, merely stone. Generally, the pulses of the four seasons all originate from the stomach qi; hence, with sufficient stomach qi, there is life, with little stomach qi, there is illness, and without stomach qi, there is death. Among the strings, hooks, hairs, and stones, there is always a gentle quality that represents stomach qi. This chapter has its similarities and differences from the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng says: The people of Yue want to make the pulse easier to understand, hence the emphasis on its meaning. According to the fifth volume of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; in the discussion of the characteristics of the balanced person, it states: The liver pulse comes soft and weak, flickering like the tip of a long pole. The lung pulse comes wearisome and listening, like falling catalpa pods. The kidney pulse comes with wheezing and heaviness, like a hook, firm when pressed; the pulse of a diseased kidney comes harder like a strong hemp, while the pulse of a dead kidney feels like the loss of a knot, brisk like flicking stone—these are the differences. </p>
<p>The stomach is the sea of water and grains, governing the four seasons, all deriving from stomach qi, hence referred to as the change in diseases of the four seasons, key points in life and death. </p>
<p>Hua Shou says: The stomach is associated with earth, which corresponds to the number five; all things return to it, hence it is called the sea of water and grains. Water, fire, metal, and wood all depend on it for existence, thus it governs the four seasons. &quot;Bing&quot; means to provide and to supply.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>The spleen is the central region, its balance and harmony are not visible, only its decline can be seen. It comes like a bird&#39;s pecking, like water dripping through a leak; this is the manifestation of a weakened spleen. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The spleen is the central region, referring to the space between breaths, where the spleen receives the flavors of grains, its pulse being in the middle. Its balance and harmony cannot be seen. The spleen governs the royal functions across the four seasons, but cannot solely master them. When the pulses of the four organs are balanced and harmonious, the spleen&#39;s pulse is also central. The decline manifests like a bird pecking at a roof, differing from the usual. The bird&#39;s pecking indicates a pulse that is strong and sharp but intermittent and uncertain; leaking water signifies a pulse that is slow, dispersed, moving but then ceasing.]</p>
<p>The &quot;Sixteen Difficulties&quot; states: The pulse has three sections and nine indicators, includes yin and yang, light and heavy, and sixty variations. One pulse transforms into the four seasons, having long since parted from the sage; each follows its own law. How, then, can we distinguish them? </p>
<p>[Xie said: This section raises six issues regarding the three sections and nine indicators, while the text does not answer the questions posed, suggesting there is missing text. Now, discussing the three sections and nine indicators, it should be found in the third chapter of the eighteen difficulties, indicating that this piece has mistakenly placed it here. Yin and yang refer to the fourth difficulty; light and heavy refer to the fifth difficulty; the transformation of one pulse into the four seasons discusses the spring string, summer hook, autumn hair, and winter stone in the fifteenth difficulty. As for the sixty variations, according to the “Inner Canon” in the section on flourishing and declining, it states: the sage holds to the way of diagnosis, considering yin and yang together, the patterns of the odd and constant, which yield the sixty variations. Wang&#39;s commentary states that the odd and constant yield sixty variations, now lost in the modern world, reflecting its long historical absence.]<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Indeed. This illness has both internal and external signs.<br>[Hua Shou said: This is a response, not directly addressing the previous question; there must be another inquiry.]<br>What should be done about this illness?<br>[Hua Shou said: This asks for details on the internal and external signs.]  </p>
<p>Indeed. Suppose one grasps the liver pulse; its external signs: good cleanliness, a bluish face, and a propensity for anger; its internal signs: movement in the left side of the abdomen, firm upon pressing and possibly painful; the illness presents with fullness in the limbs, difficulty in urination and defecation, and muscle cramps. If these are present, it is the liver; if they are not, it is not.<br>[Hua Shou said: Grasping the liver pulse also diagnoses the string-like pulse. The liver and gallbladder combine to form the clean and clear organ, hence good cleanliness. The liver is the general&#39;s organ, hence the propensity for anger. Happiness is akin to goodness and fondness. A bluish face reflects the color of the liver; these are favorable signs of color and pulse. The left side of the abdomen pertains to the liver; if firm upon pressing, it indicates the movement and firmness of qi, possibly causing pain. Feng noted: If liver qi (Yue Zhen) is constrained, there will be fullness in the limbs. The &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; states that wind will bring about latent illness. The jueyin pulse circulates along the yin organs, hence liver illness leads to difficulty in urination and defecation. Muscle cramps arise as the liver governs the sinews. This corresponds to the internal signs and the targeted illness.]<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>If one obtains the heart pulse, the external signs are a flushed face, dry mouth, and a tendency to smile; the internal signs show movement above the navel, and pressing it reveals a firm pain. The illness includes agitation of the heart, heart pain, heat in the palms, and dry heaving. If one has these signs, it pertains to the heart; if not, it does not.</p>
<p>[Huashou comments: The palm refers to the area where the heart meridian passes. The true heart does not succumb to evil; rather, the palms bear that burden. Dry heaving refers to retching. When there is heart illness, fire accumulates, hence the retching. Classic texts say: all upward reversals belong to fire; all sour vomiting belongs to heat.]</p>
<p>If one obtains the spleen pulse, the external signs are a pale face, frequent belching, good thinking, and preference for flavors; the internal signs show movement at the navel, and pressing reveals a firm pain. The illness includes abdominal distention, inability to digest food, body heaviness and joint pain, lethargy, and a tendency to sleep on. If one has these signs, it pertains to the spleen; if not, it does not.</p>
<p>[Huashou comments: The &quot;Lingshu&quot; text states that belching occurs when cold qi invades the stomach, causing it to surge upward and exit, thus producing belching. Classic texts say: the spleen governs the limbs.]</p>
<p>If one obtains the lung pulse, the external signs are a pale face, frequent sneezing, sadness, and a desire to cry; the internal signs show movement on the right side of the navel, and pressing reveals a firm pain. The illness includes asthma, coughing, and alternating chills and fever. If one has these signs, it pertains to the lungs; if not, it does not.</p>
<p>[Huashou comments: Qibo states: Yang qi harmonizes and fills the heart, emerging through the nose, thus resulting in sneezing. Alternating chills and fever correspond to the lungs&#39; governance over the skin and毛.]<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>If one obtains the kidney pulse, the external signs are a dark face and a tendency to fearfulness; the internal signs are moving qi below the navel, firm upon pressure and possibly painful; the illness is characterized by rebellious qi, sharp pain in the lower abdomen, and diarrhea that is heavy and watery, with coldness in the legs and shins. If these signs are present, it is associated with the kidneys; if not, it is not.</p>
<p>The Seventeenth Difficulty states: The classics mention that illnesses may lead to death, or may not be treated yet heal on their own, or may persist for years without resolution. Can the matter of life and death be discerned by pulse-taking? Yes, it can be fully understood. </p>
<p>Diagnosis of an illness, if one closes their eyes and does not wish to see others, should reflect the liver pulse—strong, urgent, and long; if instead, one feels the lung pulse—floating, short, and thin—it indicates death. </p>
<p>If a patient opens their eyes and is thirsty, with a firm feeling below the heart, the pulse should be tight and rapid; if instead, it is deep, thin, and weak, it indicates death.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>If a patient vomits blood and additionally has a nosebleed, the pulse should be deep and thin; however, if it is instead superficial, large, and tight, this indicates death. 【Hua Shou said: The pulse of a patient losing blood should be solid, which is contradictory.】</p>
<p>If a patient is delirious and speaks nonsense, their body should exhibit heat, and the pulse should be surging and large, but if the hands and feet are cold and the pulse is deep, thin, and weak, this indicates death. 【Hua Shou said: A Yang disease showing a Yin pulse is contradictory.】</p>
<p>If a patient has a large abdomen and experiences diarrhea, the pulse should be weak and thin, but if it is instead tight, large, and slippery, this indicates death. 【Hua Shou said: Diarrhea with a large pulse is contradictory. A large abdomen refers to abdominal swelling.】</p>
<p>The &quot;Eighteen Difficulties&quot; states: the pulse has three divisions, and each division has four vessels. The hands have Taiyin and Yangming, while the feet have Taiyang and Shaoyin, determining the upper and lower divisions. What does this mean? 【Hua Shou said: This section poses a question, stating that within the twelve main meridians of a person there are three divisions, each containing four vessels. The hands have Taiyin and Yangming, the feet have Taiyang and Shaoyin, thus forming upper and lower divisions. The three divisions refer to the cun, guan, and chi, which separate upper, middle, and lower; the four vessels refer to cun, guan, chi, which pair off two by two, hence each division contains four vessels. The Taiyin and Yangming on the hands and the Taiyang and Shaoyin on the feet indicate upper and lower divisions, where the lung is located on the right cun and the kidney on the left chi, mutually supporting one another, with the lung being above and the kidney below, symbolizing the mother-child relationship. The texts say that the essence is higher than the lung and the essence is lower than the kidney.】<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Indeed. The hand Taiyin (Yin Metal) corresponds to the Yangming (Metal), while the foot Shaoyin (Yin Water) corresponds to the Taiyang (Water). Metal produces Water, which flows downwards and cannot rise, hence it is in the lower part. The foot Jueyin (Yin Wood) corresponds to the Shaoyang (Yang Wood), which produces the hand Taiyang (Yang Fire) and Shaoyin (Yin Fire). Fire rises upward and cannot descend, thus it represents the upper part. The hand Xin (Heart) governs the Shaoyang (Yang Fire) and produces the foot Taiyin (Yin Earth) and Yangming (Earth), where Earth governs the central part. All of these signify the reciprocal generation and nurturing of the Five Elements.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou remarks: The hand Taiyin (Yin Metal) and foot Taiyang (Yin Water) are in the lower part because Water is inherently downward flowing. The foot Shaoyin (Yin Water) generates the foot Jueyin (Yin Wood), which in turn generates the hand Shaoyin (Yin Fire) and which governs the fire from the hand Xin. Fire ascends and thus represents the upper part. Fire generates the foot Taiyin (Yin Earth), which resides in the central part and further produces the Lung Metal. This dynamic illustrates the reciprocal generation and nurturing of the Five Elements. This can be interpreted as confirming the structure of the upper and lower parts according to the generative properties of the organs rather than waiting for a predetermined order of generation. Furthermore, there is an elaboration into a tripartite framework, referring to the four difficulties discussed: heart and lung being elevated, kidney and liver being lower, while the spleen symbolizes the central region. However, while the former strictly refers to the organs, this perspective includes both channels and organs. The above questions and answers clarify the classic text, with the following two sections not obscuring each other, leading to suspicions of errors in the source material.]<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The pulse has three divisions and nine qualities; what does each govern? Indeed. The three divisions are the cun, guan, and chi. The nine qualities refer to the superficial, middle, and deep states. The upper division corresponds to the heavens and governs ailments from the chest upwards to the head; the middle division corresponds to humans and governs ailments from the diaphragm down to the navel; the lower division corresponds to the earth and governs ailments from the navel down to the feet, which must be examined and needled carefully. </p>
<p>[Xie states: This section should be viewed as a response in the &quot;Sixteen Difficulties.” The simplified characters are misplaced here, omitting the context of the three divisions and nine qualities. The phrase about careful examination and needling emphasizes the need to assess the pulse&#39;s movement and the underlying illness; hence, it is mentioned as careful examination and needling. The act of needling refers to detecting movement corresponding to the illness. Chen Wannian’s transmission states that &quot;needle quality&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;detecting quality,&quot; while some say: needling refers to acupuncture, meaning to examine the division carefully before needling.]<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>If a person is ill with stagnation accumulating over a long time, can this be determined through pulse diagnosis? </p>
<p>Yes. When examining the pulse, if there is stagnation in the right flank, and one feels a knot in the lung pulse, then the more pronounced the knot, the greater the accumulation; if the knot is slight, then the accumulation is also slight. </p>
<p>If the lung pulse is not detected yet there is stagnation in the right flank, why is this? Even if the lung pulse is not apparent, the pulse on the right hand should be found to be somewhat submerged.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Is the method for treating external stubborn diseases the same as for internal accumulation? It seems they are different.</p>
<p>Yes. When the pulse is stagnant, it stops irregularly when coming and going; this is called stagnation. When the pulse is hidden, it runs beneath the tendons; when the pulse is floating, it runs above the flesh. The methods are thus similar for both interior and exterior conditions.</p>
<p>If, for instance, the pulse is both stagnant and hidden, it indicates there is no internal accumulation; if the pulse is floating and stagnant, it indicates there is no external stubborn disease. If there is accumulation, the pulse will not be stagnated or hidden; if there is a stubborn disease, the pulse will not be floating or stagnant. This is a case where the pulse does not correspond to the disease, and the disease does not correspond to the pulse, which is classified as a terminal condition.</p>
<p>The nineteenth difficulty states: the classics mention that the pulse can be reversed or aligned. What does this mean?</p>
<p>The term &quot;aligned&quot; refers to constancy. The pulse can indeed be reversed or aligned, comparing the two genders. The male pulse is typically upper at the barometric level, while the female pulse is generally lower. A male&#39;s pulse at the wrist is usually weak, whereas a female&#39;s pulse at the wrist is often strong; this is the distinction between their pulses. Reversal refers to the opposite of their norm. Nonetheless, both genders have their respective consistencies. &quot;Reversal&quot; signifies a deviation from their usual state.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Indeed, a man is born in the hour of Yín, which is associated with wood and is yang; a woman is born in the hour of Shēn, which is associated with metal and is yin. Therefore, the male pulse is located at the upper gate, while the female pulse is at the lower gate. Thus, the male pulse is consistently weak at the wrist, whereas the female pulse is consistently strong; this is their nature.</p>
<p>[Huá Shòu said: This relates to the origins of living beings, concerning the duality of male and female. The Jì family stated: At the beginning of life, everything originates from the zi, which is the source of all things. From zi, if we proceed left for men by thirty degrees, we arrive at sǐ; if we proceed right for women by twenty degrees, we also reach sǐ. This indicates the numerical principles of marriage between men and women. From sǐ, conception occurs: a man rotates left for ten months to be born in Yín, which is wood and yang; a woman rotates right for ten months to be born in Shēn, which is metal and yin. Xie said: Yín is wood, and wood generates fire; thus, fire arises from Yín and has an upward, fiery nature, so the male pulse is at the upper gate. Shēn is metal, and metal generates water; thus, water emerges from Shēn and flows downward, leading to the female pulse being at the lower gate. I humbly suggest that the yang body is light, clear, and ascends, in accordance with heavenly principles, thus the male pulse is at the upper gate; the yin body is heavy, turbid, and descends, in line with earthly principles, hence the female pulse is at the lower gate. This is the normal state of men and women.]<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>The reversal occurs when the male acquires the female pulse and the female acquires the male pulse. </p>
<p>What illness is associated with this? </p>
<p>Indeed, when the male acquires the female pulse, it indicates deficiency, with the ailment located within. If the pulse is left-sided, the illness is on the left; if right-sided, the illness is on the right. This is determined by the pulse. When the female acquires the male pulse, it signifies excess, with the ailment located in the extremities. If the pulse is left-sided, the illness is on the left; if right-sided, the illness is on the right. This is also determined by the pulse. </p>
<p>The difficulty in understanding this says that the abnormality leads to excess or deficiency, indicating internal or external ailments.</p>
<p>The twenty difficulties state: The classics mention that pulses can be hidden; what organs hide them? Indeed, this refers to the interplay of yin and yang. When the pulse is in the yin area and the yang pulse appears, it indicates yang surmounting yin; even if the pulse is occasionally deep and thin, this refers to yang hidden within yin. When the pulse is in the yang area and the yin pulse appears, it indicates yin surmounting yang; even if the pulse occasionally feels superficial and slippery, this refers to yin hidden within yang. </p>
<p>As indicated, &#39;within&#39; means it is present and should be so. The yin pulse is measured at the cun (inch), while the yang pulse is measured at the chi (foot). The term &#39;surmount&#39; is akin to riding atop a vehicle. The term &#39;hidden&#39; relates to the concealment of soldiers. &#39;To hide&#39; means to store away. The Ding family states that this does not only refer to the cun as yang and the chi as yin; when considering the upper and lower contexts, the muscles above correspond to the yang area, while those below correspond to the yin area. This also connects.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>The &quot;Double Yang&quot; refers to madness; the &quot;Double Yin&quot; refers to insanity. Those who lose Yang see ghosts, while those who lose Yin become blind. </p>
<p>The Twenty-First Hardship states: The classics say that when a person’s form is sick but their pulse is not, it is called life; when the pulse is sick but the form is not, it is called death. What does this mean? Indeed, if a person’s form is sick but their pulse is not, it does not mean there is nothing wrong. It refers to the breath not aligning with the pulse. This is a great principle. </p>
<p>Zhou Zhongli said: Within the body, one may feel haggard, the spirit foggy, appetite lacking for food, yet the pulse corresponds with the four seasons without any extremes; this is a case of the form being sick while the pulse is not. Conversely, if the form is stable and harmonious but the pulse fluctuates between strong and weak, comes and goes erratically, appears taut yet is floating and slippery, or is deep and turbid without consistency, this indicates the pulse is not in harmony with the form, showing that the pulse is sick while the person is not. </p>
<p>Zhongjing states: A person whose form is sick but pulse is not is termed internally empty, lacking vital energy; their spirit may be weary but not in pain. Conversely, a person whose pulse is sick but form is not is termed a &quot;walking corpse,&quot; lacking royal energy; they may suddenly faint, fail to recognize others, and die prematurely. </p>
<p>Xie said: According to the original text, the wording and meaning seem misaligned, possibly indicating a loss of coherence.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>The Twenty-Second Difficulty states: The classics say that there are movements in the meridians and diseases that arise. When one meridian transforms into two diseases, what is the reason? Indeed, the classics indicate that the movements refer to qi; the diseases that arise refer to blood. If the pathogen resides in qi, then qi causes the movement; if the pathogen resides in blood, then blood produces the resultant disease. Qi governs the respiration, while blood governs nourishment. If qi is stagnant and does not circulate, it indicates an initial disease of qi; if blood is obstructed and does not nourish, it indicates a subsequent disease of blood. Therefore, the movement occurs first, followed by the disease.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: &quot;Respiration&quot; refers to warmth; qi governs respiration, which means a person&#39;s true qi flows in and out, warming and evaporating between the skin and flesh. Blood governs nourishment, referring to the way a person&#39;s blood vessels moisten the muscles and bones, lubricating the joints and nourishing the organs. This term &#39;meridian&#39; does not refer to mere dimensions but rather to the pathways of the twelve meridians. It is stated that within each meridian, there are indeed two diseases because they are differentiated by the presences of qi and blood. If the pathogen is in qi, then qi causes the movement; if it is in blood, then blood produces the disease. Stagnation of qi indicates a disease of qi, while stagnation of blood demonstrates a blood disease; thus, the movement occurs first and the disease arises afterward. The sequence implies that qi is external and blood is internal; when the exterior first encounters the pathogen, does the interior also follow suit and become ill? Yet, pathogens may only reside in qi or directly in blood; we cannot bind ourselves strictly to the sequence. The classics refer to the &quot;Suwen,&quot; Chapter 10.]<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>The twenty-third difficulty states: The three Yin and three Yang meridians of the hands and feet can this be understood in terms of lengths? Yes. The three Yang meridians of the hands extend from the hands to the head, measuring five feet, equivalent to thirty-six inches, or three zhang; the three Yin meridians of the hands extend from the hands to the chest, measuring three feet five inches, equivalent to eighteen inches, or two zhang one foot; the three Yang meridians of the feet extend from the feet to the head, measuring eight feet, equivalent to forty-eight inches; the three Yin meridians of the feet extend from the feet to the chest, measuring six feet five inches, equivalent to thirty-six inches, or three zhang nine feet; the meridian that connects the two feet to the eyes measures seven feet five inches, equivalent to four zhang; the Governor Vessel and the Conception Vessel each measure four feet five inches, adding to nine feet. In total, the lengths of the meridians amount to sixteen zhang two feet, which is the measurement of the lengths of the twelve primary channels.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>Huashou said: This is the full text of the twenty-seven chapters of the &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; The three yin and three yang are referred to in &quot;Ling Shu&quot; as six yin and six yang, making the meaning even clearer. According to the flow of the channels, the three yang of the hands run from the hands to the head, while the three yin of the hands run from the abdomen to the hands; the three yang of the feet run from the head down to the feet, and the three yin of the feet run from the feet up into the abdomen. This describes the degrees of the channels, hence they are all referred to from the perspective of the hands and feet. The two feet accompany the yin channel, which originates in the middle of the heel, naturally rising up behind the bone, going above the inner ankle, straight up, along the inner thigh into the yin, along the abdomen and into the chest, passing through the missing basin, exiting in front of the person’s welcoming point, entering the inner corner of the mouth and connecting with the inner canthus of the eye, combining with the sun channel to form the separate branch of the foot&#39;s lesser yin. The channel of the three yang of the feet stretches eight feet from the feet to the head. The &quot;Records of Labor&quot; also states that the human body is eight feet long, thus it is described in terms of the same body dimensions.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>There are twelve primary meridians and fifteen collateral meridians; what are their beginnings and ends? Indeed. The primary meridians circulate blood and qi, connecting yin and yang, nourishing the body. Their beginning is from the middle jiao, entering the hand taiyin and yangming; yangming enters the foot yangming and taiyin; taiyin enters the hand shaoyin and taiyang; taiyang enters the foot taiyang and shaoyin; shaoyin enters the hand xinzhu and shaoyang; shaoyang enters the foot shaoyang and jueyin; jueyin then returns to the hand taiyin. The fifteen collaterals separate from these, each deriving from their origins. Like a ring without an end, they continually irrigate one another, directing to the pulse at the wrist, thereby addressing all diseases and determining life and death. </p>
<p>【Hua Shou said: &quot;Yin&quot; means to follow. &quot;Yuan&quot; means beginning. &quot;Zhao&quot; refers to a morning gathering for usage. This follows the measurement of the primary meridians mentioned above, inferring the pathways of the collaterals. The direct pathways are called primary, while those branching off are called collaterals.】<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>The twelve channels have twelve collaterals, along with the Yang and Yin collaterals, making a total of fifteen collaterals concerning the large collateral of the spleen. Xie noted: Starting from the middle burner refers to the food entering the stomach and being stored there; its subtle essence transforms and flows into the hand Taiyin and Yangming, which successively pass on to the foot Jueyin, and then the Jueyin returns to the hand Taiyin. The fifteen collateral vessels all originate from the twelve primary channels, irrigating one another, like a boundless loop, reaching the pulse at the wrist and the Renying point, which can address all ailments and decide life and death. The Renying point at the wrist is traditionally identified with the arteries moving alongside the throat; during the Jin dynasty, Wang Shuhe defined it as the point at a division of the left hand in relation to the pulse, while the right hand division became the Qikou point, and later generations followed this. I humbly believe the reason the ancients designated Renying and Qikou is that Renying corresponds to the foot Yangming stomach channel, which receives the essence of grains and nourishes the five organs, while Qikou corresponds to the hand Taiyin lung channel, which regulates and balances the hundred vessels.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>The Classic text states: Understanding the beginning and the end, the interplay of Yin and Yang is determined. What does this mean? Indeed, the beginning and the end refer to the regularity of the pulse. At the cun (寸) location, the Ren (人) pulse connects the energies of Yin and Yang, flowing like a seamless loop, hence it is called the beginning. The end signifies the severing of the three Yin and three Yang pulses; when they are severed, death occurs, and death takes various forms, hence it is called the end. </p>
<p>Hua Shou commented: According to the teachings of Xie, the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; (灵枢经) states in its ninth section that all methods of acupuncture conclude with the beginning and the end. Understanding the beginning and the end organizes the five organs, fixing the Yin and Yang. It also states: For those who are not ill, the pulse at the cun and Ren points responds to the four seasons; those with diminished energy will find both pulses weak and unresponsive to measurements. This section refers back to the previous mention of the cun and Ren pulses, which determines life and death across various diseases, suggesting that to grasp the beginning and end is to stabilize Yin and Yang. Essentially, the Yang meridians are determined by the Ren pulse, while the Yin meridians depend on the Qi pulse. The morning messenger signifies the harmony of Qi and blood, as tides rise according to the time, demonstrating the mutual use of Yin and Yang. The beginning is akin to the start of life, while the end represents the culmination of that life. To understand life and death, one must observe the pulse. The Qi of Yin and Yang flows into the morning messenger, like an unending loop, thus a person is free from illness; should there be any disruption in this flow, illness arises. Particularly, if the pulses of the three Yin and three Yang are severed, death is inevitable. The forms of death will be detailed in the following sections, which should be referenced accordingly.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>The Twenty-Four Difficulties states: When the three yin and three yang energies of the hands and feet have been exhausted, how can one discern what is favorable or unfavorable? Indeed, when the lesser yin energy in the feet is gone, the bones become shriveled. The lesser yin corresponds to the winter pulse, which flows quietly and warms the bone marrow; therefore, if the bone marrow is not warm, the flesh does not adhere to the bones. If bones and flesh are not close, the flesh becomes moist and recedes; when the flesh is moist and recoils, the teeth grow long and become brittle, and the hair lacks luster. The absence of luster indicates the bones die first. On the day of Wu, it becomes intense, and on the day of Ji, it dies. 【&quot;Moist&quot; is pronounced as &quot;soft.&quot;】 【Shuai Shou commented: The following six sections are mostly similar to those in the tenth chapter of &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; The essence of the kidneys manifests in hair, and its fullness resides in the bones. When the kidneys are exhausted, they can no longer nourish the bones or give vitality to the hair. &quot;Flesh moist, receding&quot; refers to the flesh shrinking away from the bones. Wu and Ji represent earth, and as earth conquers water, it thus dies on the day it dominates.】<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>When the energy of the foot Taiyin is exhausted, the pulse does not nourish the lips.

On the day of Jia, it becomes severe; on the day of Yi, it dies. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The spleen&#39;s manifestation is in the lips and the four whites, and its substance is in the flesh. When the spleen is exhausted, the flesh becomes taut and the lips retract. The taut flesh means that the muscles are not smooth and moist but rather tense (月真).]</p>
<p>When the energy of the foot Jueyin is exhausted, the tendons contract, pulling the ovary and curling the tongue. Jueyin pertains to the liver vessel. The liver is the gathering of the tendons. The tendons are grouped in the genital organs and connect to the root of the tongue. Thus, when the pulse does not nourish, the tendons contract tightly, pulling the ovary and the tongue. Hence, the tongue curls and the ovary shrinks, signifying that this tendon is dying first. On the day of Geng, it becomes severe; on the day of Xin, it dies.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The liver is the vessel of gathering; its manifestation is in the nails, and its substance is in the tendons. The tendons are grouped in the genital organs and connect to the root of the tongue. When the liver is exhausted, the tendons contract, pulling the ovary and the tongue. Wang Chong in &quot;Lunheng&quot; states: For those experiencing illness on the days of Jia and Yi, the periods of life and death will always occur on the day of Geng Shen.]<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>When the Hand Taiyin energy is exhausted, the skin and hair become scorched. Taiyin refers to the lungs, which circulate energy and warm the skin and hair. If energy fails to nourish, the skin and hair scorch; if the skin and hair scorch, bodily fluids are depleted. When bodily fluids are depleted, the skin and joints suffer damage; when the skin and joints are damaged, the skin dries and the hair falls out, leading to the death of hair. On a Bing day, it is profound, and on a Ding day, it dies. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The lungs are the root of qi; their manifestation is in the hair, and their essence is in the skin. When the lungs are exhausted, the skin and hair scorch, and bodily fluids are lost, resulting in joint damage, as all fluids converge at the joints.]</p>
<p>When the Hand Shaoyin energy is exhausted, the pulse does not flow; when the pulse does not flow, the blood does not circulate; when the blood does not circulate, the complexion fades, resulting in a face as black as soot, indicating the death of blood first.

<p>When the energies of all three Yin are exhausted, the eyes become dizzy and turn away, and if they close, it is a sign of lost will; when will is lost, it indicates the death of intention, leading to the closing of the eyes. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The three Yin are referred to in terms of the pathways of the hands and feet. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; mentions that when all five Yin energies are exhausted, this also pertains to the Hand Jueyin and Hand Shaoyin, converging in the heart vessel. Dizziness and closing of the eyes, referred to as the loss of Yin, lead to blindness, indicating severity. Thus, when the eyes close, the will is lost, signifying the death of intention.]</p>
<p>[The Chen family of Siming said: When the Yin energies of all five viscera are exhausted, the will is lost internally, which prevents vital energy from reaching the eyes, leading to an inability to see people and ultimately death.]<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>When the six yang energies are completely exhausted, yin and yang separate; when yin and yang separate, the pores leak, leading to a cessation of sweat that emerges large like a string of pearls, turning out but not flowing.

<p>[Hua Shou states: When sweat emerges but does not flow, this is due to the failure of yang.] </p>
<p>[Chen&#39;s commentary suggests: When the yang energies of the six fu organs are completely exhausted, the vital energies scatter outward, thus the fluids escape and lead to death.]</p>
<p>The twenty-fifth difficulty states: There are twelve meridians, five viscera, six hollow organs, and eleven channels. What is this one channel? It is the channel of the hand shao yin (lesser yin) and the heart&#39;s controlling collateral. The heart&#39;s governing function is linked with the san jiao (triple burner) as they are interrelated in name but not in form, hence it is said that there are twelve meridians. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou explains: This section of questions and answers indicates that the five viscera and six hollow organs correspond to the yin and yang of the hands and feet, but there are only eleven channels. One of them is considered as one channel due to the hand shao yin and the heart&#39;s governing function being distinct channels. The heart&#39;s controlling function and the san jiao are interrelated in name but not in form, constituting this one channel along with the five viscera and six hollow organs, making a total of twelve channels.]</p>
<p>Xie states: The &quot;Nanjing&quot; discusses the hand shao yin, heart governing, and san jiao over eight chapters. The thirty-first difficulty elaborates on the beginnings and ends of the san jiao meridian. The thirty-seventh difficulty mentions that there are two kidneys, the left is the kidney and the right is the ming men (gate of life), initially not distinguishing between the left and right kidneys in the pulse of the two hands.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>The thirty-eighth difficulty in articulating the Sanjiao (Triple Warmer) pertains to the differentiation of the original energy, which governs all energies, further emphasizing its name yet formless nature. The thirty-ninth difficulty in discussing the Mingmen (Gate of Life) refers to the place where spirit resides; in men, it stores essence, while in women, it connects to the womb, and this energy communicates with the kidneys. It is also stated that although there are six fu organs, there are actually five, and the Sanjiao is considered one of them. In the eight difficulties, as well as in the sixty-second and sixty-sixth chapters, it discusses the movement of energy within the kidneys, which is fundamental to human life and the root of the twelve meridians. This is called the original energy, and thus the Sanjiao serves as a vessel for this original energy. By understanding this text and examining their relationships, one can see how the Sanjiao fits into the definition of the six fu organs. It is solely because it has a name yet remains formless that it can align with the hand heart meridian. The heart rules the hand Jueyin, and its channel begins in the chest and ends at the tip of the little finger. In contrast, the hand Shaoyin begins in the heart and ends at the inner side of the little finger. Therefore, the hand Shaoyin and the heart each represent a distinct channel. Someone might ask, why does the hand Jueyin meridian refer to the heart and also to the heart protector? The answer is: the sovereign fire is named, while the ministerial fire is positioned.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>The hand&#39;s yin aspect governs the heart&#39;s fire in action, thus it is called the heart&#39;s center; in terms of channels, it is called the pericardium. One channel has two names, both refer to the heart fire. Yu Shu states: Various schools say the gate of life is the heart fire, related to the sanjiao (triple warmer) in its inner and outer relationships. However, in the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; it only refers to the heart center and the sanjiao without mentioning the gate of life in relation to the sanjiao. </p>
<p>The left wrist corresponds to fire, the right to metal; the left gate corresponds to wood, the right to earth; the left inch corresponds to water, the right to fire. The placement and meaning of these are evidently clear! According to Yu’s view, the heart center and sanjiao are interrelated and govern the action of the heart fire. The thirty-six difficult questions mention that the energy of the gate of life connects with the kidneys, suggesting it is not separate from the kidneys. Is this not referred to as the &quot;trigram of water&quot;? The heart center represents a position of fire, while the gate of life expresses a shared energy of water. </p>
<p>The gate of life cannot be deemed the heart fire, and it is also clear that the sanjiao does not associate with the gate of life.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>The discussion of the Yu school is indeed profound! The reason various schools are confused and indecisive is likely due to their misunderstanding of the &quot;True Words of the Golden Coffer,&quot; where Wang&#39;s annotations cite the &quot;Rectification Theory&quot; indicating that the San Jiao (Triple Warmer) is named yet formless, connecting the Heart Master above and the Right Kidney below, which leads to the concept of the San Jiao relating to the Life Gate. </p>
<p>The organs of a person have both Yin and Yang, and are respectively paired; how could there be a theory of one channel pairing with two? The notion that it connects with the Heart Master above truly implies a relationship of exterior and interior; the connection with the Right Kidney below refers to the San Jiao as the distinct envoy of Original Qi. Understanding this clarifies that the Life Gate connects with the Kidney and that there cannot be dual pairing for the San Jiao. Hence, the various claims can be discerned and made clear without confusion.</p>
<p>Regarding pulse diagnosis, the Hand Jueyin (Liver) Fire resides at the right wrist, and the San Jiao is the same. Since the Life Gate connects with the Kidney, it should be at the left wrist. Yet, Xie states in the &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; that the Hand Jueyin is at the same location as the Hand Shaoyin (Heart) pulse; the San Jiao pulse appears at the inch, is evident in the pass, and links with the Kidney at the lower Jiao. Previously, it was stated that the left and right Kidneys should not divide the pulses of the hands and feet, so how should the right wrist be examined according to what the &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states?<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>The twenty-sixth difficulty states: The classics mention twelve channels and fifteen collaterals. What are the three additional collaterals? There are the Yang collaterals, the Yin collaterals, and the Great Collateral of the Spleen. The Yang collaterals refer to the channels of Yang Qi. The Yin collaterals refer to the channels of Yin Qi. Therefore, there are fifteen collaterals.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The straight paths are called channels, while the branches are called collaterals. The channels are like the main flow of the rivers, while the collaterals are like tributaries. Each channel has a collateral: the twelve channels have twelve collaterals. For example, the Hand Taiyin channel is associated with the Lung collateral and the Large Intestine, while the Hand Yangming channel is associated with the Large Intestine and the Lung. Now, when saying there are fifteen collaterals, it refers to the Yang collaterals, Yin collaterals, and the Great Collateral of the Spleen. The Yang and Yin collaterals are discussed in the twenty-eighth difficulty. The term &quot;collaterals&quot; indicates that the extraordinary channels do not adhere strictly to the twelve channels, and they may simply be referred to as collaterals. The Great Collateral of the Spleen, called Da Bao, emerges three inches below the chest and spreads across the lateral sides, responding to the influence of ancestral Qi.]</p>
<p>[The Chen family of Siming said: The Yang collaterals encompass all Yang collaterals; the Yin collaterals encompass all Yin collaterals; the Great Collateral of the Spleen, further, governs both Yin and Yang collaterals, just as the Spleen can nourish the five organs.]<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>The twenty-seventh difficulty states: The pulse has eight extraordinary vessels, which are not confined to the twelve regular channels; why is this? There are the Yang Wei, Yin Wei, Yang Qiao, Yin Qiao, Chong, Du, Ren, and Dai vessels. All these eight vessels are not bound by the channels, hence they are called the eight extraordinary vessels. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou states: The pulse has both extraordinary and regular. The twelve channels are the regular pulses. The eight extraordinary vessels are thus not bound by the twelve standard channels, hence they are called extraordinary. &quot;Extraordinary&quot; in relation to &quot;regular&quot; is similar to how military strategies differentiate between extraordinary and regular tactics.]</p>
<p>[Yu says: &quot;Extraordinary&quot; refers to the concept of the unexpected, meaning these eight vessels do not link to the regular channels of yin and yang, lacking mutual correspondence, pursuing their distinct paths, thus called extraordinary vessels. Among these eight vessels, the Du vessel governs the back, the Ren vessel governs the front, the Chong vessel is known as the sea of all yang, the Yin and Yang Wei provide connection throughout the body, and the Dai vessel restrains like a belt; the Yang Qiao is associated with the differentiation of the sun, while the Yin Qiao is fundamentally a distinction of the lesser yin.]<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>There are twelve channels and fifteen networks, totaling twenty-seven energies that follow one another up and down; why should they alone not be bound to the channels? Indeed. The sage designs canals and watercourses to facilitate water flow, preparing for unexpected events. When heaven rains down and the canals overflow, at that moment, mischief arises, and the sage cannot design again. At this point, the networks are overflowing, and the channels cannot be bound anymore.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The flow of the channels has its regular measure, but the Eight Extraordinary Vessels cannot follow one another; hence the sage&#39;s design of canals serves as a metaphor. It shows that when the networks overflow, the channels cannot be restrained, resulting in these extraordinary vessels. So, do the extraordinary vessels arise from the overflow of the networks? Some say: the term &quot;networks&quot; points specifically to the extraordinary vessels, which are not confined to the channels, and may rightly be called networks.] </p>
<p>[This section highlights the names of the Eight Vessels and the meaning of why they are considered extraordinary.]<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>The twenty-eighth difficulty states: The eight extraordinary vessels, which do not conform to the twelve primary channels, where do they originate and how are they connected? </p>
<p>Indeed. The Governing Vessel originates at the lower back&#39;s point, travels along the spine, ascends to the Wind Palace, and enters the brain. The Conception Vessel begins below the central point, rises at the base of the hairline, goes through the abdomen, ascends to the Sea of Qi, and reaches the throat. The Penetrating Vessel starts at the Qi Chong, follows the stands of the Yangming channel, rises above the navel, and spreads within the chest. The Belt Vessel originates at the lateral costal region, wrapping around the body. The Yang Heel Vessel begins at the center of the heel, traverses along the outer ankle, and enters the Wind Pool. The Yin Heel Vessel also begins at the heel&#39;s center, travels up the inner ankle to the throat, and intersects with the Penetrating Vessel. The Yang and Yin Linking Vessels connect throughout the body, accommodating and allowing the flow to nourish and irrigate the various channels.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>Thus, the Yang vessels arise from the convergence of various Yang channels, while the Yin vessels emerge from the intersections of various Yin channels. It is like a sage who designs ditches; when the ditches overflow, they flow into deep lakes, thus the sage cannot contain the flow. In humans, the vessels flourish but do not encircle, hence the twelve channels also cannot be contained. When they receive pathogenic energy, they accumulate and can lead to swelling and heat, resulting in needling and moxibustion.</p>
<p>[Huashou comments: &quot;Ji&quot; is noted as &quot;xi&quot; in the &quot;Pulse Canon.&quot; &quot;Du&quot; signifies &quot;capital,&quot; representing the sea of Yang vessels, where all Yang vessels converge. The vessels rise from the lower extreme points, through the perineum and continue along the spine to the Dazhui point, intersecting with the three Yang vessels of the hands and feet, then ascending to the Yumen point where they connect with the Yangwei vessel, reaching the Baihui point where they meet the Taiyang channel, and further up to the nasal column at the Renzhong point where they connect with the Yangming channel. The Ren vessel arises from below the Zhongji point at the pubic bone. The Ren vessel represents nurturing, serving as the foundation for human life.]<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>The Chong vessel originates at the Qichong point, spreads through the chest, and is known as the sea of yin vessels. The Inner Canon states it is associated with the lesser yin meridians of the feet. The Chong vessel travels through the pylorus, connecting to the gut and moving upwards, all of which are lesser yin, aligning with the Inner Canon. The Du, Ren, and Chong vessels all begin at the perineum, indicating they share a single source that branches into three paths. The Dai vessel starts one inch and eight tenths below the lateral costal region and wraps around the body like a belt. The Yang Qiao vessel originates from the midpoint of the heel at the Shenmai point and flows around the outer ankle. The Yin Qiao vessel also begins at the heel at the Zhaohai point and flows around the inner ankle. The term &quot;Qiao&quot; signifies agility. Since both vessels originate from the foot, they embody the idea of quickness and transcendence. The Yang Wei and Yin Wei vessels connect throughout the body, serving as the supportive framework for yin and yang.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>The Yangwei channel is initiated at the Yang convergence, separate from the Golden Gate, where it intersects with Yang. It connects with the hands and feet of the Sun channel at the shoulder point, and meets the Sun channels of the hands and feet at Tianliao and Jianjing, respectively. It also intersects with the Sun channel of the feet at Yangbai, extending upwards to Shen, Linqi, Zhengying, and Naokong, and downwards to Fengchi, converging with the Governing Vessel at Fengfu and Yamen. This is the origin of the Yangwei channel at the convergence of the various Yang channels. </p>
<p>The acuity of the Yinwei channel is referred to as Zhubin, which intersects with the foot Taiyin at Funa and Dahu, and also connects with the foot Taiyin and Jueyin at Fush and Qimen, as well as with Renmai at Tiantu and Lianquan. This indicates the origin of the Yinwei from the convergence of the various Yin channels. </p>
<p>Excess and retention that cannot circulate and irrigate the twelve channels must refer to the twelve characters, which should fit within the twelve channels yet cannot be confined to them, allowing for unfettered interaction. The reception of pathogenic energies, as noted in the twelve characters, has been deemed as potentially lacking text above and below in the original writings by the Xie family, yet concerning the meridians, there appears to be no such, raising suspicions about textual additions. Others suggest that it should be placed under the thirty-seven difficult points, unable to fulfill its mandate and resulting in death, since the pathogenic influences pertain to the six fu organs.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>The Twenty-Ninth Difficulty states: What are the ailments of the extraordinary channels? Indeed. Yang Wei is connected in the Yang, and Yin Wei is connected in the Yin. If Yin and Yang cannot support each other, then one will feel lost and aimless, unable to gather oneself. When Yang Wei is ailing, there is suffering from cold and heat. When Yin Wei is ailing, there is suffering from heart pain. When Yin Qiao is ailing, Yang is slow while Yin is urgent. When Yang Qiao is ailing, Yin is slow while Yang is urgent. When Chong is ailing, there is reversed qi and internal urgency. When Du is ailing, the spine is rigid and there is a sensation of coldness. When Ren is ailing, there is internal distress; for men, it manifests as seven kinds of hernias, and for women, it manifests as accumulations. When Dai is ailing, there is abdominal fullness, and the waist feels as if submerged in water. This describes the ailments of the eight extraordinary vessels. [The phrase &quot;when Yang Wei is ailing&quot; mentions the total categories of deficiencies and errors.] [Hua Shou said: This speaks of the diseases of the extraordinary channels.]<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>If Yin cannot be maintained within Yin, then one will feel lost and disheartened. If Yang cannot be maintained within Yang, then the energies cannot self-regulate. Yang governs actions in the realm of Yang and signifies protection; protection represents Qi, and Qi resides on the surface, hence the suffering from extreme cold and heat. Yin governs actions in the realm of Yin and signifies nourishment; nourishment represents blood, which belongs to the heart, thus leading to heart pain. </p>
<p>When the pulse is affected in Yang, it manifests as urgency; when affected in Yin, it also shows urgency. Those who are ill feel anxious, while those who are not recover on their own. The Chong vessel runs from the lower abdomen to the throat, hence the feeling of rebellious Qi and urgency. The Du vessel runs along the back, leading to rigidity and extremities feeling cold. The Ren vessel begins at the gate of the womb and travels through the abdomen, hence the internal suffering from stagnation, with men experiencing seven hernias and women suffering from masses.</p>
<p>If one rotates around it, the symptoms present themselves accordingly. &quot;Lack of strength&quot; is a notable appearance. Each condition is described based on the corresponding meridians. From the twenty-seven difficulties onward, the meanings are interconnected, and it is advisable to explore them thoroughly.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>The &quot;Thirty Difficulties&quot; states: Is the function of the nourishing qi always accompanied by the protective qi? Indeed. The classics mention that food enters the stomach, then is transmitted to the five organs and six bowels; all five organs and six bowels receive qi. The pure essence is for nourishment, and the turbid essence is for protection. Nourishing qi circulates within the meridians, while protective qi flows outside them, nourishing ceaselessly, reaching fifty and then returning to great harmony, where yin and yang interlink, like a seamless circle. Hence, it is known that nourishment and protection accompany each other.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: This passage aligns with the words of the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; chapter eighteen. While food enters the stomach and is transmitted to the five organs and six bowels, the “Spiritual Pivot” states that it enters the lungs, with the five organs and six bowels all receiving qi, which is somewhat different. All receive the essence of qi, referring to the qi from water and grain. The return to great harmony at fifty is discussed in one of the difficulties. The Chen family of Siming said: Nourishment is yin, its movement is inherently slow; protection is yang, its movement is inherently fast. However, the pure is smooth and effective, while the turbid is vigorous and forceful; neither is sluggish in form. Thus, when protective qi moves outside, nourishing qi follows within, indicating their movement is consistently accompanied, encompassing their measure.</p>
<p>The Wang family of HunNan said: The pure is the essence of the body, it is yang, it is fire; one aspect of yin descends from the center, thus, after noon, one yin is born, this refers to the heart producing blood, therefore it is said that the pure qi is for nourishment. [The clear of heaven does not descend, the turbid of earth can descend through the six yin, driving it downward. The term &quot;clear qi&quot; is addressed in relation to the essence of separation.]<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>The turbid represents the lower aspect, the yin, the water. Within the depths, one yang arises, hence when the offspring of yang is born, it is the vital energy of the kidney, therefore it is said that turbid qi serves as the guardian. </p>
<p>The earth&#39;s turbidity does not ascend; the clarity of the earth can rise to form the six yangs, elevating and letting them ascend. When we speak of turbid qi, it refers to the overall essence of the depths. </p>
<p>The classics say: the earth&#39;s qi rises to form clouds, while the air&#39;s qi descends to create rain; rain arises from the earth&#39;s qi, and clouds emerge from the heavens&#39; qi—this is what it refers to. </p>
<p>I humbly suggest that in terms of application, pure qi represents the essence, being the pure part within the turbid; while turbid qi, serving as the guardian, is the turbid part within the pure. Speaking of essence, the use of the pure does not separate from the essence of the turbid, and the use of the turbid does not separate from the essence of the pure. Therefore, it is also valid to say that pure qi represents the essence and turbid qi serves as the guardian, or to say that essence, turbidity, guardian, and purity can be interchangeable.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>Ji also said: &quot;The Suwen states that &#39;the nutritive essence is the refined energy of food and water, which is clear; the protective energy is the coarse energy of food and water, which is turbid.&#39; When the refined energy enters the channels, it becomes turbid; when the coarse energy moves outside the channels, it is clear. Someone asked about the Thirty-Two Difficulties: &#39;Blood is for the nutritive essence, and qi is for the protective energy. Why is both the nutritive and protective essence described in terms of qi?&#39; The answer is: &#39;The classics state that the nutritive essence is the refined energy of food and water, and the protective energy is the coarse energy of food and water. It further states that the clear energy is for the nutritive essence, while the turbid energy is for the protective essence. Generally speaking, both the nutritive and protective essence are functions of the energy from food and water, so it is appropriate to refer to them using the term qi. However, when analyzed in detail, the nutritive essence refers to blood and the protective essence to qi, which have their distinct roles. Therefore, the nutritive essence flows within the channels, while the protective essence circulates outside the channels, similar to water in rivers and lakes or wind and clouds in the vast emptiness.&quot;<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>The Difficulties of Bian Que: Volume on the Lower Jiao</strong></p>
<p><strong>Difficulty Thirty-One:</strong> What is the nature of the San Jiao (Three Jiao)? How does it originate and how does it conclude? Where does its treatment normally take place? Can this be elucidated? Yes. The San Jiao is the pathway of food and fluid, where Qi begins and ends. The Upper Jiao is located beneath the heart, above the diaphragm, within the stomach, governing internal matters without release, its treatment is in the Zhongji (central vessel), one and a half inches below the Xuanfu (suspended hall) between the two breasts. The Middle Jiao is in the middle of the stomach, neither ascending nor descending, governing the fermentation of food and fluid, its treatment lies beside the navel. The Lower Jiao is at the entrance of the bladder, governing the differentiation of clear and turbid, promoting outflow rather than influx to facilitate the pathway, its treatment is one inch below the navel. Thus, it is called the Three Jiao, whose cavities are in the pathways of Qi.</p>
<p>[Slightly different interpretation: The term &quot;pathway&quot; may also be written as &quot;Chong&quot;.] </p>
<p>[Hua Shou stated: The organs and viscera of the human body possess form and shape, have nature and life, such as the liver obtaining Qi from wood and generating from water, and the heart obtaining Qi from fire and generating from wood, and this applies universally. Only the San Jiao is formless, and what it receives and generates is merely the Yuan Qi (original Qi) and the stomach Qi, hence it is described as the pathway of food and fluid, where Qi begins and ends. The treatment of the Upper Jiao is in the Zhongji, the treatment of the Middle Jiao is at the Tianshu point beside the navel, and the treatment of the Lower Jiao is at the Yinjiao point one inch below the navel. “Treatment” is akin to “govern”, similar to the governance of prefectures and counties, referring to the areas of the San Jiao. Some say to pronounce &#39;treatment&#39; with a level tone, suggesting that when there is illness in the San Jiao, each section should be treated accordingly, implying needling methods. The San Jiao represents the fire of the heart; fire can ferment and mature all things, and &#39;Jiao&#39; relates to the essence of fermentation, hence the naming and meaning may derive from this.]<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>The eighteenth chapter of the &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: The upper focus emerges from the mouth of the stomach, extends above the throat, passes through the diaphragm, spreads in the chest, travels to the armpit, follows the pathway of the Taiyin channel, and returns to the Yangming channel at the sublingual area under the foot of Yangming, consistently traveling in the Yang at twenty-five degrees, and in the Yin also at twenty-five degrees, thus completing a circuit. Hence, at fifty degrees, it converges again at the hand of Taiyin. The middle focus is also adjacent to the stomach&#39;s entrance; after the emergence from the upper focus, it receives the air, processes the dregs, steams the fluid, transforms its essence, and ascends into the lung meridian, being refined into blood to nourish the body. Nothing is more precious than this, so it uniquely circulates through the meridian pathways, and is referred to as Yingqi (Nutritive Qi). The lower focus differs by connecting the small intestine to the bladder, seeping into it.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>Thus, the water and grain are constantly combined in the stomach, transforming into dregs that descend together into the large and small intestines to form the lower jiao. They seep down, mixing and separating the juices, following the lower jiao to penetrate the bladder. Xie states: By examining the text of the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; it becomes evident that the three jiaos have names but no tangible form. Ancient scholar Yuan says: The so-called three jiaos reside within the fatty tissues of the diaphragm, in the spaces between the five organs and six bowels, where water and grain flow and transform. Their qi merges within, steaming and affecting the diaphragm, spreading to the skin and flesh, circulating to all sides, referred to as upper, middle, and lower, each named according to its respective region, essentially being agents of the original qi. Therefore, although they lack physical form, they take their names from the inner and outer forms; and although they lack substantiality, they occupy positions by combining inner and outer realities. I foolishly note that the phrase regarding their location in the channels seems to be erroneous or extended. The three jiaos naturally belong to the various organs, with their channels being associated with the hand&#39;s lesser yang, and connected to the hand&#39;s heart, each having its own therapeutic locale, and should not be considered as additional organs.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>The Thirty-Second Difficulty states: The five organs are equal, yet the heart and lungs uniquely reside above the diaphragm. Why is this? Indeed. The heart represents blood, while the lungs represent qi; blood is for nourishment, and qi is for defense, mutually supporting each other up and down, termed nourishment and defense. They circulate through the meridians, nourishing from without, hence the heart and lungs are situated above the diaphragm. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The nourishing function of the heart and the defensive function of the lungs circulate through the meridians and nourish from without, much like the celestial way operating above. The diaphragm acts as a barrier. In humans, there is a membrane beneath the heart, connected with the spine and ribs, which blocks turbid qi from rising and affecting the heart and lungs.]</p>
<p>[Chen of Siming said: This specifically refers to their positional hierarchy. If discussing the virtues of the five organs, there is more to say. Since the heart and lungs are capable of generating life through blood and qi, they are the parents of the body; naturally, given the honor of parents, they reside above. The &#39;Neijing&#39; states: Above the diaphragm lies the central region containing the parents. This is what is meant.]<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>The thirty-third difficulty states: The liver is likened to wood, and the lungs to metal; when the liver receives water, it sinks, while wood floats; when the lungs receive water, they float, while metal sinks. What does this mean? Indeed, the liver is not purely wood. It corresponds to the yang aspect, and the yin aspect is related to the soft nature. It speaks broadly of yin and yang, and more specifically of husband and wife, releasing its subtle yang while absorbing subtle yin energy. Its essence is in pleasure and the path of yin, hence causing the liver to sink when it receives water.</p>
<p>The lungs are not purely metal either; they correspond to the yin aspect. It speaks broadly of yin and yang, and more specifically of husband and wife, releasing its subtle yin to join with fire. Its essence is in pleasure and the path of yang, hence causing the lungs to float when they receive water. </p>
<p>Why do the lungs settle down again while the liver floats, and why does the liver settle again while the lungs float? Therefore, it is understood that the yin corresponds to the yang aspect, as does the liver to the metal element. </p>
<p>[Huashou comments: The Chen family from Siming states that the liver corresponds to the wood element, reflecting the sounds of the angles, which are heavy and turbid. When analyzed, it can be seen that the yang aspect corresponds to wood&#39;s yang aspect, while the yin aspect corresponds to wood&#39;s yin aspect; together they are all yang.]<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>Due to its association with the lesser yang and its position in the yin part of the human body, it is recognized as the yang within yin. Yang must necessarily unite with yin; the yin and yang of jia and yi are inherently paired, and yi connects with geng, embodying the way of hardness and softness. Yi harmonizes with the subtle yang of jia and counteracts the joy of metal, thus receiving the subtle yin energy of geng, forming a marital relationship. The nature of wood is inherently buoyant; as it receives the energy of metal and inhabits the path of yin, it thus acquires water and sinks. Upon maturity, the received energy of metal departs, yi returns to jia, and the original nature of wood naturally becomes buoyant again. The lungs belong to geng and xin metal, responding to the sound of shang and embodying lightness and clarity. Analyzing it, geng represents the yang of metal, while xin represents the yin of metal; combined, they are both yin. Since it is associated with the greater yin and located in the yang part of the human body, it is considered yin within yang. Yin must necessarily unite with yang; the yin and yang of geng and xin are inherently paired, and xin connects with bing, reflecting the way of hardness and softness. Xin harmonizes with the subtle yin of geng, thus counteracting the joy of fire, and forms a marital relationship with the yang of bing fire. The nature of metal is fundamentally heavy; as it receives the energy of fire and rises, it occupies the path of yang, thus acquiring water and floating.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>When it is sufficiently matured, the fire’s essence is removed, and the yin wood (乙) returns to the yang metal (庚), causing the essence of metal to naturally sink. The ancient scholar Yuan said: the liver represents the yin wood (乙), and the lungs represent the yin metal (辛), corresponding to their respective sounds. The combination of 乙 and 庚, and that of 丙 and 辛, resembles a marital relationship. Thus, they temporarily relinquish their inherent natures to follow the influences of their partners&#39; essences, demonstrating the interaction of yin and yang. Moreover, the liver is located below the diaphragm, while the lungs reside above; the upper is yang and the lower is yin. Their pathways express differentiation, causing wood to float and reflect the sinking nature of metal, while metal sinks and reflects the upward movement of fire. Everything, when reaching its extreme, will reverse, and when it undergoes transformation and change, it returns to its origin and its true nature. Hence, when the liver and lungs mature, they each manifest the inherent nature of wood and metal. The Ji school states: the liver is the yang within yin, having a predominant yin quality and does not conform to wood, thus it sinks with water. The lungs are the yin within yang, having a predominant yang quality and do not conform to metal, thus they float with water. This refers to their larger aspects. However, speaking of their smaller aspects, the relationships of 乙, 庚, 丙, and 辛 represent the path of marital dynamics.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>When they become熟 (ripe) and the processes of settling and floating reverse, each returns to its origin, hence they reveal their true nature. The Zhou school says: the liver stores blood, which is the essence of Yin; having more blood and less Qi, its body becomes congealed and obstructed. Although there are meridians and internal pathways, they cannot compare to the exquisite emptiness, therefore it sinks when water is present. When熟, the moist and nourishing aspect transitions to dryness; the congealed and obstructed transforms into an unobstructed void, suitable for floating. The lungs govern Qi, which is Yang; having more Qi and less blood, its body hangs down and is light, with openings and passages that are exquisite; the meridians branch out, hence it floats when water is present. When熟, the body tightens and contracts; the openings become obstructed and solid; those that were lightly expansive transform into tightness, which is suitable for sinking. This natural principle aligns with the subtle transformations of the five elements. Xie says: this reasoning derives from the nature of things. I humbly assert that the liver is Yang, a form of Yang within Yin; since Yin is more abundant, it is called微阳 (subtle Yang), residing below and following the Yin path. The lung is Yin, a form of Yin within Yang; since Yang is more abundant, it is called微阴 (subtle Yin), residing above and following the Yang path. When熟, it loses all delight and returns to its essence, why is this? Because when things become熟, the mingling of energies disperses.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br>The Thirty-Fourth Difficulties states: The five organs each have their own sounds, colors, odors, and tastes, which can all be understood, correct? Yes. The Ten Transformations says: The liver is green in color, has a rancid smell, a sour taste, a sound like a call, and its fluid is tears. The heart is red in color, has a burnt smell, a bitter taste, a sound like speech, and its fluid is sweat. The spleen is yellow in color, has a fragrant smell, a sweet taste, a sound like singing, and its fluid is saliva. The lungs are white in color, have a fishy smell, a spicy taste, a sound like crying, and its fluid is mucus. The kidneys are black in color, have a rotten smell, a salty taste, a sound like groaning, and its fluid is spittle. These are the sounds, colors, odors, and tastes of the five organs. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou commented: This describes the functions of the five organs; the terms sound, color, odor, and taste are lacking the word for fluid. The liver is green, has a rancid smell, corresponds to wood; the call signifies the emission of wood; the sour taste is derived from the bending and straightening as it becomes sour; the fluid of tears relates to the eyes.]<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>The heart is red, with a burnt smell, and it transforms through fire; speaking raises the fire; its taste is bitter, as heat produces bitterness; its fluid is sweat, which is related to blood, as sweat pertains to blood. The spleen is yellow with a fragrant smell, and it transforms through earth; singing is the softening of earth, and it is said that the spleen&#39;s spirit enjoys music, thus its sound is primarily song; its taste is sweet, as agriculture produces sweetness; its fluid is saliva, which connects to the mouth. The lungs are white, with a fishy smell, and they transform through metal; crying is the sorrow of metal; its taste is spicy, formed from the skin; its fluid is mucus, which connects to the nose. The kidneys are black, with a rotten smell, and they transform through water; groaning resembles the sound of water; its taste is salty, as moisture creates saltiness; its fluid is spittle, related to water.</p>
<p>The Chen family of Siming states: the kidneys are located far away; if they do not extend, the energy cannot reach the breath, hence the sounds of groans come from the kidneys. However, the lungs govern sound, the liver governs color, the heart governs smell, the spleen governs taste, and the kidneys govern fluids. The five organs are interconnected and encompass each other, thus it is said there are ten transformations.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>The five organs have seven spirits; what does each contain? Indeed. The organs are the dwelling places of the spirit and energy of a person. Therefore, the liver contains the soul, the lungs contain the body, the heart contains the spirit, the spleen contains intention and wisdom, and the kidneys contain essence and will. </p>
<p>[Huashou said: The organs are places of storage; the spirit and energy of a person are contained within. The soul is the assistant of clarity; it follows the spirit and is called the soul. The body is the complement of essence; it enters and exits in conjunction with essence and is called the body. The spirit is the transformation of essence; when two essences are thin together, it is called spirit. The spleen governs thinking, thus storing intention and wisdom. The kidneys are the officials of strength, facilitating skill, thus they store essence and will. This discussion pertains to the functions of the five organs regarding their spirits; thus the five functions manifest outwardly while the seven spirits are contained inwardly.]</p>
<p>The thirty-fifth difficulty states: The five organs each have their own functions, and the viscera are all similar, yet the heart and lungs are uniquely distant from the large and small intestines. Why is this so? Indeed. The classics state that the heart nourishes the lungs and circulates yang energy; hence, it is positioned above. The large and small intestines transmit yin energy and are positioned below; thus they are distanced from each other. </p>
<p>[Huashou said: The heart nourishes the lungs, circulates yang energy, and resides above; the large and small intestines transmit yin energy and reside below, hence the necessity of their distance.]</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the viscera are yang; being places of purity, why are the large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and bladder all subject to impurity? </p>
<p>[Huashou said: If all the viscera are yang, they should be pure places. Why then do the large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and bladder all receive impurities?]<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>Indeed. To refer to the various organs as such is incorrect. The classics say that the small intestine is the organ of reception; the large intestine is the organ of transmission and excretion; the gallbladder is the organ of purification; the stomach is the organ of food and drink; the bladder is the organ of fluids. Since one organ cannot have two names, it is clear that this is not the case. The small intestine is the organ of the heart, the large intestine is the organ of the lungs, the gallbladder is the organ of the liver, the stomach is the organ of the spleen, and the bladder is the organ of the kidneys. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: To call the organs places of purity is incorrect. Now, the large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and bladder each have their own roles, therefore they are not merely places of yang purity. Each is an organ of the five viscera, it is indeed inappropriate to give them two names. The essence of the organs is yang, but their function is yin, which is what the classics refer to when they say the turbid yin returns to the six organs. It is stated that all organs are yang, and the place of purity is solely the gallbladder.]</p>
<p>The small intestine is called the red intestine, the large intestine is called the white intestine, the gallbladder is called the green intestine, the stomach is called the yellow intestine, and the bladder is called the black intestine, governing the lower focus. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: This differentiates the five viscera by their colors, and all are referred to by the term &quot;intestines.&quot; The phrase regarding the lower focus pertains to the bladder, which is responsible for separating the clear from the turbid.]<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>The thirty-sixth difficulty states: Each organ has one ear, yet the kidneys possess two. Why is this? Indeed, the two are not both considered kidneys; the left one is the kidney, while the right one is the Mingmen. The Mingmen is the dwelling of the spirits and the connection to the original Qi. For men, it is where essence is stored, and for women, it is where the womb is connected. Thus, it is known that the kidneys have one aspect.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou commented: The kidneys have two aspects, with the left being the kidney and the right being the Mingmen. Men store essence here and receive the essences of the five organs and six bowels; women connect to the womb here, allowing them to receive essence and facilitate transformation. The original Qi refers to the moving Qi between the kidneys below the navel, the essence of life for humans, and the root of the twelve meridians. This text indicates that not both are kidneys; the thirty-ninth difficulty also states the left is the kidney and the right is the Mingmen, asserting that their Qi connects with the kidneys, demonstrating that the two aspects are essentially one. Therefore, the &quot;Xiang family teachings&quot; cite Sha Sui Cheng Ke Jiu, stating: &quot;In the north, two entities are commonly paired; it is why Kan is associated with things as tortoise and snake, representing the direction of winter and north, and in the great source, it represents the unseen and the dark.&quot; The &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states: &quot;Organs have one aspect, yet the kidneys alone have two,&quot; which refers to this concept.]</p>
<p>[This also connects to the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth difficulties; a thorough understanding can be derived from consulting them in order.]<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>The Thirty-Seventh Difficulty states: Where does the vital energy of the five organs originate? Where does it connect? Can it be explained? Indeed. The five organs are connected to the nine orifices above. Thus, the lung’s energy connects to the nose; when the nose is harmonious, one can discern aromas and odors. The liver’s energy connects to the eyes; when the eyes are harmonious, one can discern black and white. The spleen’s energy connects to the mouth; when the mouth is harmonious, one can discern the flavors of grains. The heart’s energy connects to the tongue; when the tongue is harmonious, one can discern the five tastes. The kidney’s energy connects to the ears; when the ears are harmonious, one can discern the five sounds. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: Xie mentions that this section inquires about where the energy of the five organs originates and where it connects, but the answer only describes the connection of the five organs to the nine orifices and does not address their origin, which might indicate a missing text. It is my humble opinion that the origin of the five organs should be consistent with the explanation given in the Twenty-Third Difficulty regarding flow. The mention of the nine orifices in relation to the seven orifices in the &#39;Ling Shu&#39; is the same below.]<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>When the five organs are not harmonious, the nine orifices are obstructed; when the six bowels are not harmonious, it leads to the formation of abscesses. </p>
<p>If the pathogen resides in the six bowels, then the yang channels are not harmonious; when the yang channels are not harmonious, qi becomes stagnant, and if qi is stagnant, the yang channels become excessive. If the pathogen resides in the five organs, then the yin channels are not harmonious; when the yin channels are not harmonious, blood becomes stagnant, and if blood is stagnant, the yin channels become excessive. When yin energy is too excessive, yang energy cannot thrive, hence it is said to be inhibited. When yang energy is too excessive, yin energy cannot thrive, hence it is said to be obstructed. When both yin and yang are excessive, they cannot interact, thus it is termed as blocked obstruction. Blocked obstruction means one cannot fully live out their life and may die. </p>
<p>This closely resembles the text from the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; Chapter Seventeen. It is sometimes said that when the pathogen accumulates, it causes swelling and heat, and one should use acupuncture to dispel it, which should be seen as a conclusion to this chapter. Indeed, when the energies of yin and yang are excessively strong, it leads to blocked obstruction, which is fatal. However, if one simply suffers from the invasion of pathogens, accumulation should appropriately be treated with acupuncture. This refers to treating the conditions related to the six bowels not being harmonious and the pathogens residing therein.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>The text states that qi travels independently within the five organs and does not participate in the six bowels. Why is this so? Indeed, the path of qi is like water flowing without pause. Hence, the yin channels circulate in the five organs, while the yang channels nourish the six bowels, forming a loop with no end that is hard to track. It ends and begins again, unspilling and overflowing. The qi within a person remains warm in the organs and moist externally in the skin.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: This extrapolates from the previous chapter’s discussion on “nourishing.” It is similar to the seventeenth chapter of the &quot;Lingshu.&quot; When it is said that qi travels independently in the five organs and does not nourish the six bowels, it does not mean that it does not nourish the six bowels; rather, in the yin channels it nurtures the five organs, and in the yang channels it nourishes the six bowels. The qi circulates continuously like an endless loop, thus protecting against any potential gravity or overflow, allowing the internal qi to remain warm in the organs and to be moist externally in the skin.]</p>
<p>[Chen from Siming remarks: When there is evil in the bowels, the yang channels are vigorous; when there is evil in the organs, the yin channels are vigorous. If the yin channels are vigorous, it implies that the yin qi is concentrated below; if the yang channels are vigorous, then the yang qi is blocked above, but this does not lead to death. When both yin and yang are vigorous, there is both blockage and constraint, resulting in vomiting and food not being ingested, while both yin closes off, preventing bowel movements and consequently leading to death. If the qi of the organs and bowels is harmonious and nourishes one another, with no excess from the yin and no overflow from the yang, then there would be no blockage or constraint!<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>The thirty-eighth difficulty states: &quot;The organs have only five, while the bowels have six; what is the reason for this?&quot; Indeed, the reason the bowels are said to have six is because of the triple warmer. There is a distinction regarding the original qi, which governs various energies; it is named but has no form. Its channel corresponds to the Hand Shao Yang and is classified as a bowel. Thus, it is said that the bowels have six.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: The triple warmer governs various energies and serves as the distinct messenger of the original qi. The original qi relies on its guidance to move silently and operate within the body without interruption. The external bowel refers to its channel as the Hand Shao Yang, for the triple warmer has a channel outside but no form within; hence it is stated in detail in the sixty-sixth difficulty.]<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>The thirty-ninth difficulty states: The classics say there are five intestines and six organs; what does this mean? Indeed. The six intestines refer to the normally five intestines. As for the five organs, there are also six; this is because the kidneys have two organs, the left being the kidney and the right being the gate of life. The gate of life is where the spirit resides; in men, it stores essence, and in women, it is connected to the womb. Its energy communicates with the kidneys, hence it is said there are six organs. What does it mean that there are five intestines? Indeed, each of the five organs corresponds to one intestine, and the triple warmer also counts as one intestine; however, it does not belong to the five organs, thus it is said there are five intestines.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou commented: In the previous section, it stated there are five organs and six intestines; this says there are five intestines and six organs because the kidneys have two. Although the left and right gates of life are distinguished, their energies are interconnected, thus they are collectively considered as the kidneys. The five intestines are understood by aligning the triple warmer with the hand&#39;s main function. When considering all sections, one can say there are five organs and six intestines, or five organs and five intestines, or six organs and six intestines.]<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>The &quot;Forty Difficulties&quot; states: The classics say the liver governs color, the heart governs odor, the spleen governs taste, the lungs govern sound, and the kidneys govern fluids. The nose is a proxy of the lungs, allowing an understanding of fragrance and odor, while the ears are a proxy of the kidneys, enabling the perception of sound. What does this mean? Indeed, the lungs represent metal in the west. Metal is generated in the hours of the snake, which corresponds to the fire of the south. Fire relates to the heart, which governs odor, hence allowing the nose to discern fragrance and odor. The kidneys represent water in the north. Water is generated in the hours of the monkey, which corresponds to metal in the west. Metal corresponds to the lungs, which govern sound, thus allowing the ears to perceive sound. </p>
<p>[Huashou remarks: The Fourth Ming Chen family states that odor is governed by the heart, the nose is the orifice of the lungs, and as the heart’s vessels connect to the lungs, this gives the nose the ability to discern fragrance and odor. The ears are the orifice of the kidneys, and sound is governed by the lungs; thus, as the vessels of the kidneys connect to the lungs, this allows the ears to hear sound. I foolishly note that the perspectives of the Yue people likely arise from the principle of the generative cycle of the five elements, further exhibiting their interdependence and utility.]<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>The forty-first difficulty states: The liver has only two lobes; how does it respond? Indeed. The liver is associated with the east and wood, and wood represents spring. As all things begin to grow, they are still young and unattached, remaining close to the moon and not far from the sun. Therefore, it possesses dual characteristics, hence the two lobes, which correspond to the leaves of wood.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The Chen family of Siming notes: The interrelation of the five organs is like the way of mother and child. Thus, the kidney is the mother of the liver, belonging to the greater yin; the heart is the child of the liver, belonging to the greater yang. The position of the liver is close to the kidney and not far from the heart either. I foolishly believe that the liver’s two lobes correspond to the wood of the east, representative of spring when all things begin to grow, symbolizing the dual leaves of plants. People from Yue occasionally observe this and establish discussions around it, yet it isn’t absolute; it isn’t completely false either. When discussing the greater yin and greater yang, it need not refer strictly to the organs and seasonal phenomena, but rather that the depth of winter represents the peak of yin and early summer signifies the height of yang. Referring to them as greater yin and greater yang is not inappropriate. In general, when studying, one must be flexible and vibrant, not stagnant or muddled. The ancients referred to aligning intention with will, which signifies understanding, indeed. The latter section mentions the liver having three lobes on the left and four on the right; this mention of two lobes simply sums up the larger ones.]<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>The Forty-Second Difficulty states: What is the length and capacity of the human stomach and intestines in relation to the amount of food and water they can hold? Indeed, the stomach measures one foot five inches in height, five inches in diameter, and two feet six inches in length when it is curved; it can hold three pecks five liters, of which two pecks remain as food and one peck five liters is water. The small intestine is two and a half inches wide, with a diameter of seven-tenths of an inch, and measures three zhang two feet in length, holding two pecks four liters of food and six liters three-tenths of a liter. The ileum is four inches wide, one and a half inches in diameter, and two zhang one foot in length, holding one peck and seven liters half. The large intestine is eight inches wide, two feet five inches in diameter, and two feet eight inches in length, holding nine liters three-tenths of a liter, less one-eighth of a liter. Therefore, the total length of the stomach and intestines is five zhang eight feet four inches, with a total capacity for food and water of eight pecks seven liters six-tenths of a liter. This specifies the length and capacity of the stomach and intestines. [Huashou says: The ileum refers to the large intestine. The large intestine is a general term for the anus.]<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>The liver weighs two pounds and four ounces, with three lobes on the left and four on the right, totaling seven lobes; its function is to house the soul. The heart weighs twelve ounces, containing seven orifices and three hairs, filled with three measures of essence; it serves to house the spirit. The spleen weighs two pounds and three ounces, with a width of three inches and a length of five inches, possessing half a pound of fat; it functions to warm and wrap the blood of the five organs and houses intentions. The lungs weigh three pounds and three ounces, with six lobes and two ears, totaling eight lobes; their function is to house the corporeal soul. The kidneys consist of two parts, weighing one pound and one ounce; they are responsible for housing will. The gallbladder is located between the short lobes of the liver, weighing three ounces and three pennyweights, filled with three measures of essence. The stomach weighs two pounds and one ounce, is curved and flexible, with a length of two feet and six inches, a width of one foot and five inches, and a diameter of five inches; it can hold two bushels of grain and one and a half pints of water. The small intestine weighs two pounds and fourteen ounces, with a length of three zhang and two feet, a width of two and a half inches, and a diameter of slightly less than eight-tenths of an inch, making sixteen turns to the left, holding two bushels and four pints of grain, and seven and a half pints of water.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br>The large intestine weighs two jin and twelve liang, measures two zhang and one chi in length, four cun in width, and one cun in diameter. Located to the right of the navel, it curves back with sixteen bends, holding one dou of grains and seven and a half sheng of water. </p>
<p>The bladder weighs nine liang and two zhu, measures nine cun in length and width, and can hold nine sheng and seven he of urine. The mouth is two and a half cun wide, with a distance of nine fen from the lips to the teeth, and three and a half cun deep from the teeth to the epiglottis, capable of holding five he.</p>
<p>The tongue weighs ten liang, is seven cun long, and two and a half cun wide. The pharyngeal entrance weighs twelve liang, is two and a half cun wide, and extends one chi and six cun to the stomach. </p>

The anus weighs twelve liang, measures eight cun in width, is two and a half cun in diameter, and is two zhang and eight cun long, holding nine sheng and three he of grains, and one eighth of a he. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: The meaning of this section appears in chapters thirty-one and thirty-two of the &quot;Lingshu&quot;. The Yue people compiled it into one piece, and added the weights and capacities of the five organs in the latter part. Although there may be some repetition between sections, it does not detract from its importance. The quantities mentioned for holding and capacity vary, but they do not affect the main principles, so I have retained it for those who understand.]<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>The forty-third difficulty states: If a person does not eat or drink for seven days and dies, what is the reason? Indeed. A person&#39;s stomach should contain two dou of grains and one dou and five sheng of water. Thus, an average person defecates twice a day, approximately two and a half sheng each time, totaling five sheng at midday. In seven days, that amounts to five times seven, which is three dou and five sheng, and thus the water and grains are entirely depleted. Therefore, if an average person does not eat or drink for seven days, when the water and grains and their fluids are all exhausted, death occurs.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou states: This section is similar to the thirtieth chapter of &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; When the stomach is full, the intestines are empty; when the intestines are full, the stomach is empty. This fluctuation leads to the proper flow of qi, stabilizing the five organs, harmonizing the blood vessels, and allowing the spirit to reside, for the spirit is the essence of the water and grains. Therefore, if an average person does not eat or drink for seven days, all the water, grains, and their fluids are completely depleted. Hence, it is said that when water departs, nourishment disperses, and when grains are consumed, protection is lost. When nourishment disperses and protection is lost, the spirit has nowhere to rely; this is what is meant.]<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>The Forty-Fourth Difficulty states: Where are the seven orifices? Indeed. The lips are the flying gate, the teeth are the door, the epiglottis is the swallowing gate, the stomach is the entrance, the lower opening of the stomach is the幽门 (Yōumén or the &quot;dark gate&quot;), the meeting of the large and small intestines is the阑门 (Lánmén or the &quot;barrier gate&quot;), and the lower extremity is the魄门 (Pòmén or the &quot;spirit gate&quot;). Therefore, they are called the seven orifices.</p>
<p>[Huashou comments: &quot;冲&quot; (chōng) means crucial. &quot;会厌&quot; refers to the epiglottis. &quot;会&quot; means to combine. &quot;厌&quot; means to cover, referring to the action of closing the throat when swallowing, preventing food from mistakenly entering and obstructing breath in and out. &quot;贲&quot; (bēn) and &quot;奔&quot; (bēn) are the same, indicating the sound of things rushing. The lower opening of the stomach is located two inches below the navel. The conjunction of the large and small intestines is at one inch above the water point of the navel. The lower extremity refers to the anus. &quot;魄门&quot; also carries the meaning of something hidden and profound.]<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>The Forty-Fifth Difficulty states: When the classics mention the Eight Meetings, what does it mean? Indeed. The meeting of the hollow organs is at Tai Cang, the meeting of the viscera is at Ji Xie, the meeting of the tendons is at Yang Ling Quan, the meeting of the marrow is at Jue Gu, the meeting of the blood is at Ge Yu, the meeting of the bones is at Da Zhu, the meeting of the vessels is at Tai Yuan, and the meeting of qi is at the outer Three Jiao, a straight channel between the two breasts. For internal heat diseases, one should apply to the acupoints where these meetings of qi are located.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou states: Tai Cang, also known as Zhong Wan, is four inches above the navel. The six hollow organs derive their qualities from the stomach, thus it is the meeting of the hollow organs. Ji Xie corresponds to the Zhang Men point, located at the lateral edge of the navel at the lower rib ends, serving as the source of the spleen. The five viscera derive their qualities from the spleen, hence it is the meeting of the viscera. The channel of the foot Shao Yang converges at the outer edge of the knee, known as Yang Ling Quan, located one inch below the knee in the lateral depression; it corresponds to the gallbladder and liver, with the liver being the convergence of tendons, hence it is the meeting of the tendons. Jue Gu, also known as Yang Fu, is found four inches above the outer ankle, in front of Fu Gu, with the end of Jue Gu marked like the anterior third. All marrow belongs to the bones, thus it is the meeting of the marrow. Ge Yu is located under the seventh vertebra in the back, one and a half inches to either side of the spine; it is where the qi of the foot Tai Yang emerges. The Tai Yang meridian is abundant in blood, and blood symbolizes water, hence it is the meeting of the blood.]<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>The Dazhu point is located at the back of the neck, beneath the first vertebra, one and a half inches away from the spine on both sides. The Taiyuan point is found in the indentation of the radial artery at the back of the palm, known as the &quot;cun kou&quot;; it signifies the great meeting of the pulses. The Qi converges at the Sanjiao, along a straight line between the two breasts, known as the Danzhong, which is the sea of Qi and located one inch and six tenths below the Yutang. For internal heat diseases, one must examine and select points according to their respective locations.</p>
<p>Xie notes: Sanjiao should be referred to as the Upper Jiao. Chen of Siming states that the marrow converges with the bones; marrow belongs to the kidneys, which govern the bones. The foot Shaoyang is unrelated here. The brain is the sea of marrow, and there is a point at the occipital bone, thereby it should correspond to the occipital bone; the misunderstanding is regarding the convergence with the bones. Blood converges at the Geyu point; blood is governed by the heart and stored in the liver. The Ge point is located below the seventh vertebra on both sides; above, it corresponds to the heart, and below, it corresponds to the liver, thus it is the convergence of blood. The bones converge at the Dazhu point; bones are nourished by the marrow, which extends from the brain to the Dazhu, seeping into the spinal core, passing down through the tail, infiltrating the joints; therefore, all the essence of the bones gathers here, thus it is also interconnected.</p>
<p>Ancient Yi of the Yuan family stated: a person can walk robustly because the marrow converges with the bones; they can bear heavy burdens with their shoulders because the bones converge at the Dazhu.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>The 46th difficulty states: Why do the elderly lie down and not sleep, while the young sleep but do not awaken? Indeed. The text says that the young have abundant blood and energy, their muscles are supple, and their qi pathways are clear, therefore they are alert during the day and do not awaken at night. The elderly, however, have diminished blood and energy, their muscles are not supple, and their pathways of nourishment and defense are sluggish, thus they cannot stay alert during the day and cannot sleep at night. Therefore, it is understood why the elderly cannot sleep.</p>
<p>[Huashou comments: The awakening of the elderly and the sleeping of the young are related to the surplus or deficiency of nourishment, defense, blood, and energy, consistent with the 18 chapters of the &quot;Ling Shu.&quot;]<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>Section 47 states: Why can only the human face endure the cold? Indeed. The head is where all the Yang channels converge. All the Yin meridians reach the neck and chest and then return, while only the Yang meridians ascend to the head and ears, allowing the face to withstand the cold.</p>
<p>[Huashou comments: In the fourth chapter of the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; it is stated that the head and face relate to the body’s form, belonging to the bones, connected by tendons, sharing blood, and united in Qi. When the heavens are cold, the earth cracks, and ice forms. Consequently, if hands and feet feel lethargic from the extreme cold, why does the face not cover up? Qibo says: The twelve primary meridians and three hundred sixty-five collateral pathways all have blood and Qi ascending to the face, moving through the orifices. The refined Yang Qi ascends to the eyes to form sight; the auxiliary Qi moves to the ears for hearing; the ancestral Qi rises from the nose for smell; the turbid Qi emerges from the stomach, travels through the lips and mouth for taste; and all the Qi and fluids ascend and steam the face. Additionally, the skin is thick, and the flesh is firm; thus, extreme heat and severe cold cannot overcome it. I humbly analyze that the three Yang channels from the hand run up to the head, the three Yang channels from the foot run down to the foot, the three Yin channels from the abdomen run to the hand, and the three Yin channels from the foot enter the abdomen. This explains why all the Yin meridians reach the neck and chest and then return, while only the Yang meridians ascend to the head and ears.]<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>The Forty-Eight Difficulties states: A person has three voids and three realities, what does this mean? Indeed, there is the void and reality of the pulse, the void and reality of disease, and the void and reality of diagnosis. The void and reality of the pulse are as follows: a soft pulse is considered void, while a tight and solid pulse is considered real. The void and reality of disease are: something that appears outwardly is considered void, while something that is internal is considered real; what is expressed is void, while what is unexpressed is real; a slow manifestation is void, while a rapid one is real. The void and reality of diagnosis are: a soft feeling is void, while a solid feeling is real; itching is void, while pain is real; external pain with internal comfort indicates external reality and internal void, while internal pain with external comfort indicates internal reality and external void. Thus it is called void and reality. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: A soft pulse is void, while a tight pulse is real; this is the void and reality of the pulse. What appears outwardly is void, indicating that the internal organs are damaged from within to outside, as Dong Yuan described as internal injury. What enters inwardly is real, indicating that the five evils harm from outside to within, as Dong Yuan described as external injury.]<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>Words represent the void; when the internal organs become ill, it does not arise from external pathogens, hence the mind is clear and speech is not hindered. Those who do not speak represent the real; when a person harbors internal pathogenic qi, they become confused and do not speak. Those who are slow represent the void; slowness indicates they are not urgent, and what emerges from within is gradual and delayed, not a condition developed overnight. Those who are urgent represent the real; this speaks to illnesses caused by external pathogens like wind, cold, heat, etc., with life and death at stake between five and six days. This describes the reality of the illness&#39;s void and real aspects. </p>
<p>To diagnose is to assess and observe. By examining the outside, one comes to know it, not merely by pulse diagnosis. Softness indicates the void, firmness indicates the real; these two sentences are not found in the classic texts, although the Xie family believes them to be later additions. Yang’s interpretation states that when the skin and flesh are soft and moist, it signifies the void, while tightness and strength indicate the real; thus, the presence of either does no harm. </p>
<p>When palpating the area of illness, if the painful spot is discerned, it indicates the real; thus, if it is not painful but itchy, it is not the real condition. Additionally, if there is external pain but internal ease, it signifies that the pathogen is strong externally; conversely, if there is internal pain but external ease, it suggests the pathogen is strong internally. Generally, when pathogenic qi is vigorous, it is the real; when vital essence is depleted, it is the void. This explains the diagnosis of the void and the real.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>In the section on the forty-nine difficulties, it is stated: When there is an affliction of the regular channels or an injury from the five evils, how can one distinguish between them? Indeed, anxiety and worry injure the heart; exposure to cold and drinking cold liquids injure the lungs; anger and excessive emotions that rise without descending injure the liver; overindulgence in food and fatigue injure the spleen; prolonged sitting on damp ground or overexertion in water injure the kidneys. These are afflictions of the regular channels.</p>
<p>Huashou says: The heart governs thought and is the sovereign’s organ, thus anxiety and worry injure the heart. The lungs govern the skin and hair and are considered delicate organs, hence exposure to cold and drinking cold liquids injure the lungs. The liver governs anger, and anger injures the liver. The spleen governs eating, drinking, and the limbs, so overindulgence in food and fatigue injure the spleen. The kidneys govern the bones and are associated with water; therefore, excessive effort and sitting in damp conditions injure the kidneys. All of this arises from excess in worry, anger, eating, and physical activity.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>Worry and thought, anger, eating and drinking, actions—these are things that no one can be without. When they are expressed in moderation, they cause no harm; if excessive, they will certainly injure a person. Therefore, those who are good at preserving life avoid extremes and seek a middle path. The ignorant, however, become fixated and wish to reject everything, which is not sensible at all! This is similar to the fourth chapter of the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; but differs in that it mentions a condition where one becomes hurt in the spleen due to sweating from being drunk and exposed to the wind, which is not the same.</p>
<p>Xie states: Eating and drinking and labor and fatigue are indeed two different matters. When eating and drinking are well-timed, one feels hunger and satiety. Labor and fatigue arise from overexertion and lead to exhaustion. The fundamental principle here indicates that illness comes from within the body, not from external pathogens, which is what is meant by &quot;internal injury.&quot; Some might say that sitting in dampness or entering water is also something acquired from outside, so why is this considered an internal illness? The reply is that this is not one of the six external evils of nature.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>What are the five evils? They are: wind, summer heat, dietary labor, cold, and dampness. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: Wind corresponds to wood and tends to injure the liver. Heat corresponds to fire and tends to injure the heart. Earth is related to agriculture, and the spleen governs the limbs, therefore dietary labor tends to injure the spleen. Cold corresponds to metal and tends to injure the lungs. As stated in the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;: metal is cold. Dampness corresponds to water and tends to injure the kidneys, along with mist, rain, and vapor. These five evils are external injuries, referred to as external harms.]</p>
<p>[Xie said: Spleen and stomach pathologies arise from labor and exhaustion; injuries from the five evils arise from diet.]</p>
<p>Suppose there is a heart disease, how can one ascertain if it is due to wind? In that case, the color should be red. Why is this said? The liver governs color: entering the lungs, it becomes white; entering the spleen, yellow; entering the heart, red; entering the kidneys, black. The liver is the source of heart evil, hence it is known to be red. The symptoms include body heat, fullness and pain in the flanks, with a pulse that is floating, large, and tense. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: This is an example concerning the heart, hypothetically derived from it. The liver governs color, the liver is the source of heart evil, hence the redness and body heat. A floating, large pulse indicates the heart, while flank pain and a tense pulse indicate the liver.]<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>How do we know that heat injury is related to summer? Yes, it is accompanied by a foul odor. How can we explain this? The heart is associated with odors; when injured by heat, it produces a burnt smell, a fragrant smell when affecting the spleen, a rancid smell when affecting the liver, a rotten smell when affecting the kidneys, and a fishy smell when affecting the lungs. Therefore, we understand that heart conditions from summer heat are accompanied by foul odors. The patient experiences body heat, agitation, and pain in the heart, with a pulse that is floating, large, and scattered. </p>
<p>[Huá Shòu commented: The heart is associated with odors; when the heart is damaged by summer heat, it faces illness, hence the aversion to foul smells, and the symptoms and pulse diagnosis all pertain to the heart.]</p>
<p>How do we know that issues from diet and fatigue arise? Yes, it is characterized by a preference for bitter tastes, with deficiency leading to loss of appetite and abundance leading to increased appetite. How can we explain this? The spleen governs tastes; when it affects the liver, it produces a sour taste; when it affects the heart, a bitter taste; when it affects the lungs, a spicy taste; when it affects the kidneys, a salty taste; and when it affects itself, a sweet taste. Thus, we know that spleen dysfunction affecting the heart leads to a preference for bitter tastes. The patient experiences body heat, a heavy sensation, a desire to lie down, and limbs that are unresponsive, with a pulse that is floating, large, and slow.</p>
<p>[Huá Shòu commented: The spleen governs tastes, and the spleen is related to heart dysfunction, hence the preference for bitter tastes. The body heat and large, floating pulse indicate heart issues. The heavy sensation and desire to lie down, combined with unresponsive limbs and a slow pulse, suggest spleen involvement. The lines on loss of appetite and increased appetite do not match the context and may be erroneous.]<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>How can we know if the illness is due to Cold Damage? Indeed, it comes with delirious speech. How do we say this? The lungs govern sound; when the evil enters the heart, it causes confusion in speech; when it enters the liver, it leads to weeping; when it enters the heart, it results in speech; when it enters the spleen, it manifests as song; when it enters the kidneys, it brings out moans; and when it enters oneself, it leads to crying. Thus, it is understood that the lung&#39;s evil entering the heart is the cause of the delirious speech. The symptoms include body heat, chills, and possibly severe coughing, with a pulse that is floating, large, and coarse. </p>
<p>What indicates that the illness is due to Internal Dampness? Indeed, there is a tendency to sweat that cannot be stopped. How do we discern this? The kidneys govern dampness; when it enters the liver, it leads to tears; when it enters the heart, it leads to sweating; when it enters the spleen, it leads to saliva; when it enters the lungs, it causes nasal discharge; and when it enters oneself, it results in spittle. Hence, it is understood that the kidney&#39;s evil entering the heart causes sweating that cannot be stopped. The symptoms are body heat accompanied by pain in the lower abdomen, cold extremities, and a pulse that is submerged, moist, and large. This describes the principles of the Five Evils.</p>
<p>In general, the qi of the yin, yang, organs, and meridians should be balanced. An excess or deficiency leads to a loss of the proper state, which then becomes an evil. This text discusses the imbalances in the yin-yang organs and meridians. When there is an excess, internal evils arise; when there is a deficiency, external evils can invade.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>In the Fifty Difficulties, it is said: There are various types of illness—virtual pathogens, real pathogens, marauding pathogens, subtle pathogens, and correct pathogens. How can one distinguish between them? The later ones are called virtual pathogens, the earlier ones are called real pathogens, those that are overwhelming are called marauding pathogens, those that are dominated are called subtle pathogens, and those that arise from the patient themselves are called correct pathogens.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? For instance, in the case of heart diseases: a stroke that comes afterward is a virtual pathogen, heat stroke that occurs as the main illness is a correct pathogen, illness due to dietary strain or fatigue that comes from the front is a real pathogen, a cold injury that arises from being overcome is a subtle pathogen, and dampness that comes from what one cannot withstand is a marauding pathogen. </p>
<p>Using the heart as an example clarifies the above meaning. A stroke as a virtual pathogen comes afterwards, with fire in front and wood behind. A heat stroke as a correct pathogen is derived from the illness itself (fire). Dietary strain or fatigue is a real pathogen, coming from the front (earth in front and fire behind). A cold injury is a subtle pathogen, stemming from what one is vanquished by (fire overcomes metal). Dampness is a marauding pathogen, arising from what one cannot withstand (water restraining fire). The relationship with the previous section should be examined carefully for mutual understanding.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>The fifty-first difficulty states: There are patients who desire warmth, some who desire coolness, some who wish to see others, and some who prefer not to be seen, and each case is different; it depends on which organ system is affected. Therefore, those who desire coolness and wish to see others have a condition in the fu (bowel) organs; those who desire warmth and do not wish to see others have a condition in the zang (visceral) organs. Why is this so? The fu represents yang, and yang conditions wish for coolness while also desiring social interaction. The zang represents yin, and yin conditions desire warmth, wishing to stay secluded and dislike hearing voices, thus indicating the distinction between illnesses of the zang and fu organs.</p>
<p>[The Ji family states: The fu represents yang. In the case of yang illness, there is an excess of heat and a deficiency of coolness, hence the desire for food, clothing, and living conditions to be cool. Yang is active and responds to the external, leading to the desire for social contact. The zang represents yin. In the case of yin illness, there is an excess of coolness and a deficiency of heat, thus the need for food, clothing, and living conditions to be warm. Yin is characterized by stillness and responds to the internal, resulting in the desire to stay secluded and a dislike of hearing voices.]<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>In the Fifty-Second Difficulty it is stated: Are the organs and bowels fundamentally the same? No, they are not the same. How are they not the same? The diseases of the organs are fixed and do not move; their ailments do not leave their place. The diseases of the bowels, however, resemble a flow that moves up and down, with no fixed position, thus indicating that the organs and bowels are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>[The Ding clan states: Diseases of the organs are yin, and yin represents stillness, hence they are fixed and do not move. Diseases of the bowels are yang, and yang represents motion, thus they flow up and down, with no fixed position. This explanation interrelates with the text of the Fifty-Fifth Difficulty.]</p>
<p>In the Fifty-Third Difficulty it is stated: The classics say that in the seven transmissions, one dies, and in the intervening organs, one lives; what does this mean? The seven transmissions are from one to another as they overcome their predecessor, while the intervening organs are transmitted to their offspring. Why is this said? For example, if the heart disease transmits to the lungs, the lungs transmit to the liver, the liver transmits to the spleen, the spleen transmits to the kidneys, and the kidneys transmit back to the heart, if no organ suffers further damage, it is stated that the seven transmissions result in death.</p>
<p>[The Ji clan states: The heart fire transmits to the lung metal, the lung metal transmits to the liver wood, the liver wood transmits to the spleen earth, the spleen earth transmits to the kidney water, and the kidney water transmits back to the heart fire. The heart fire receiving the transmission from water counts as one; the lung metal receiving the transmission from fire counts as two. Starting from the heart and sequentially transmitting to the lung is seven transmissions, thus the death from the seven transmissions means that no organ receives further damage.]<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>If the heart&#39;s illness transmits to the spleen, the spleen transmits to the lungs, the lungs transmit to the kidneys, the kidneys transmit to the liver, and the liver transmits back to the heart, this is the mutual transmission between child and mother, continuing in a cycle without end; therefore, it is said to be life.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: Lü Shi states that the transmission among organs occurs through the organ that it overcomes. The heart overcomes the lungs, thus the spleen transmits to the lungs; the spleen overcomes the kidneys, thus the lungs transmit to the kidneys; the lungs overcome the liver, thus the kidneys transmit to the liver; the kidneys overcome the heart, thus the liver transmits to the heart; and the liver overcomes the spleen, thus the heart transmits to the spleen. This is what is meant by the transmission of what gives rise to life. I humbly note that in the &quot;Su Wen&quot; on the theory of transmission of primary and secondary ailments, it states: Observe the intervals closely and adjust accordingly. The intervals signify mutual functioning, whereas &quot;excess&quot; indicates singular action. The mutual functioning signifies a joint transmission, transmitting what it overlaps, which is similar to Lü Shi&#39;s explanation. Singular action signifies a distinctive transmission towards what is overcome, as described in Ji Shi&#39;s argument. The principle of the Yue people fundamentally arises from this, detailed in this chapter and in the 42nd chapter of &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; However, the principle in these two texts indicates that the transmission occurs among the five organs, along with the stomach and bladder, totaling seven. They elaborate their examples, and each text is named for the transmission of ailments. Now, the Yue people refer to the seven transmissions among the organs, elucidating the principles from these two texts, using the heart as an example to demonstrate the mutual transmission of ailments. If transmission occurs towards what is overcome, and a single organ suffers twice, it results in death; if it is an interval of overcoming, as a mutual transmission between child and mother, it leads to life. This is particularly clear and straightforward.]<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>The Fifty-Fourth Problem states: Diseases of the organs are difficult to treat, while diseases of the bowels are easy to treat. What does this mean? Indeed, the difficulty in treating organ diseases arises because they transmit what overcomes them; conversely, bowel diseases are easy to treat because they transmit what they produce. Treatment approaches for both organs and bowels share similarities in the context of the seven transmissions.</p>
<p>Hua Shou remarks: Chen from Siming states that the five organs are guarded internally by the seven spirits, hence the subtle invasions are not easily transmitted. When substantial qi enters, the spirits lose their guard, leading to deeper illness, making treatment challenging, possibly even resulting in death. The six bowels are involved in the processes of transfer and transformation; their qi remains constantly open. Moreover, the gallbladder, being a clear and pure space, makes it difficult for pathogens to linger deep, thus bowel diseases are easier to treat. </p>
<p>From the perspective of the Yue people, it can be interpreted that the difficulty in treating organ diseases comes from their ability to transmit what overcomes them, while bowel diseases are easier to treat since they transmit what they generate. However, this is merely one aspect of their nature. If organ diseases transmit what they generate, they would also be easy to treat, and if bowel diseases transmit what overcomes them, they would become difficult to treat. Hence, Pang Anchang often said that among the medical texts of this world, only the words of Bian Que hold depth, which is what the &quot;Nanjing&quot; refers to. </p>
<p>The Yue people embed skills within their writings; if there are unclear parts, they encourage future generations to seek deeper understanding, right? Now, with this text, it can be said that Pang has truly grasped the essence of the Yue people.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>The fifty-fifth difficulty states: Diseases can be classified as accumulation or congestion; how can we distinguish between them? Indeed, accumulation pertains to yin qi, while congestion pertains to yang qi. Therefore, accumulation is deep and latent, while congestion is superficial and active. The place where qi accumulates is called accumulation, and the place where qi gathers is called congestion. Thus, accumulation arises from the five viscera, while congestion is produced by the six bowels. Accumulation, being yin qi, has a fixed place of origin; its pain does not stray from its region, with a clear beginning and end, both upward and downward, as well as boundaries to the left and right. Congestion, being yang qi, lacks a fundamental origin; it has no fixed point to pause, and its pain is variable in location, which is why it is termed congestion. Hence, this is how we differentiate between accumulation and congestion.</p>
<p>[Shu Shou remarked: Accumulation arises from the five viscera, which are associated with yin and represent stillness; therefore, its ailments are deep-seated and do not leave their location. Congestion comes from the six bowels, which are associated with yang and represent movement; hence, its ailments are superficial and do not remain in one place.]</p>
<p>[Yang commented: Accumulation means storage, indicating that when the flow of blood and qi is obstructed, it leads to disease.]</p>
<p>[Zhou Zhongli stated: The deep and latent nature of accumulation is initially imperceptible, gradually growing and building up over time. Congestion, on the other hand, is where the disease manifests, occurring coincidentally with blood and qi, thus it lacks a constant location, in agreement with the concepts of the fifty-second difficulty.]<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>The fifty-sixth difficulty states: Are there specific names for the accumulations in the five organs? On what days and months are they obtained? Indeed. The accumulation of the liver is called &quot;fat qi,&quot; located beneath the left rib, resembling an overturned cup, with a head and foot. If it endures for a long time, it can cause coughing and reverse flow, leading to malaria that persists for years. It is obtained on the Wujia days of late summer. How can this be explained? Lung disease transmits to the liver, which should transmit to the spleen. In late summer, the ruler’s body does not accept evils; hence, the liver wants to return to the lung, but the lung refuses to accept it, resulting in a blocked accumulation, thus one knows that fat qi is obtained on the Wujia days of late summer. </p>
<p>[Huashou says: &quot;Fat&quot; refers to fullness. The presence of a head and foot indicates a significant beginning and end. Cough and reverse flow are the distinctions of the foot jueyin, passing through the diaphragm to the lung. Liver disease causes coughing in the chest. Malaria occurs every two days; according to the Inner Canon, all five organs can have malaria, and here it is associated with wind malaria in the liver. Furthermore, malaria represents cold and heat diseases, mostly belonging to the lesser yang; the liver corresponds in both surface and interior, hence it is said to be beneath the left rib, the region of the liver.]</p>
<p>The accumulation of the heart is called &quot;fuliang,&quot; arising above the navel, as large as an arm, extending up to below the heart. If it endures for a long time, it causes vexation of the heart. It is obtained on the Gengxin days of autumn. How can this be explained? Kidney disease transmits to the heart, which should transmit to the lung. The lung, in autumn, aligns with the ruler&#39;s body, and the ruler does not accept evils; thus, the heart wishes to return to the kidney, but the kidney refuses, resulting in a blocked accumulation, hence one knows that fuliang is obtained on the Gengxin days of autumn. </p>
<p>[Huashou says: Fuliang is still and unmoving, like a beam of wood.]<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>The accumulation of the spleen is called &quot;phlegm-qi,&quot; located in the stomach area, as large as a plate. If it does not heal for a long time, it causes the limbs to become retracted, leads to jaundice, and impedes the nourishment to the skin. It is brought about by the winter days of Ren and Gui. Why is this said? Diseases of the liver pass to the spleen, while the spleen should pass to the kidneys. The kidneys correspond with the winter, and a sovereign does not accept evil influences; the spleen wishes to return to the liver, but the liver refuses to accept it, hence it remains as an accumulation. Thus, phlegm-qi is known to arise from the winter days of Ren and Gui. </p>
<p>[Huashou commented: Phlegm-qi is a blockage that does not flow. Jaundice refers to yellowing. Damp heat causes jaundice.]</p>
<p>The accumulation of the lungs is called &quot;xi-bin,&quot; located under the right rib, as large as a cup. If it does not subside for a long time, it causes cold and heat sensations, coughing, and potential lung congestion. It arises on the spring days of Jia and Yi. Why is this said? Diseases of the heart pass to the lungs, while the lungs should pass to the liver. The liver corresponds with the spring, and a sovereign does not accept evil influences; the lungs wish to return to the heart, but the heart refuses to accept it, hence it remains as an accumulation. Thus, xi-bin is known to arise from the spring days of Jia and Yi.</p>
<p>[Huashou commented: Xi-bin can manifest as either &quot;xi&quot; or &quot;bin.&quot; The lung area under the right rib is associated with the skin and hair, hence the sensations of cold and heat. While it is said that organ diseases do not transfer but remain, the lung accumulation may manifest variably; this is because the lungs govern qi. Hence, the ailments may act periodically. The kidneys also govern qi, so the same applies to bin as well.]<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>The accumulation in the kidneys is called &quot;ben tun,&quot; which emerges from the lower abdomen and rises to beneath the heart, resembling a pig. It can shift upwards or downwards at any time. If it persists for a long time, it causes wheezing, reverse breathing, bone atrophy, and shortness of breath. It is gained on the days of Bing and Ding in the summer. Why is it said this way? The disease of the spleen transmits to the kidneys, and the kidneys are supposed to transmit to the heart; when the heart governs summer, the sovereign does not accept evil influences, so the kidneys want to return to the spleen, but the spleen will not accept it, resulting in an accumulation. Thus, it is known that &quot;ben tun&quot; is gained in the summer on the days of Bing and Ding. This is the essential method for the five accumulations.</p>
<p>Hua Shou said: &quot;Ben tun&quot; is not fixed like the protrusions of a pig; the nature of the pig is restless, hence its name. The cause of wheezing and reverse breathing is the channel of the foot shaoyin, which originates from the lungs and connects to the heart, entering the chest. It is difficult to speak only of the diseases of the viscera without mentioning the diseases of the bowels; Ji&#39;s theory states this is because it does not manifest in a constant place. Yang&#39;s theory suggests that the six bowels also transmit one another, just as the five viscera do. </p>
<p>If one asks about the principles of things in the world, there is sensation and transmission; sensation is feeling, and transmission is qi. Where there is feeling, there is sensation; where there is qi, there is transmission. Now, the accumulation in the five viscera arises specifically because the qi overwhelms what cannot be transmitted.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>As for a ruler not being influenced by corruption, that is indeed true. However, if one is unable to prevail, they may desire to return to that which they have conquered. If the conquered do not accept this and instead hold on, this would indicate an emotional response. Moreover, the five organs within the human body each function as a distinct entity, akin to how the ears serve hearing and the eyes serve sight, each having their own roles but lacking thought; unlike humans, who engage with their surroundings with the heart as the master, guided by the dynamics of energy. Therefore, do the five organs truly possess emotions and responses? It is said that the thoughts of the people of Yue are based on the principles of the five elements, interpreted and articulated; initially, there is no need to argue about their emotions and responses, nor whether they reciprocate, as this is inherently unnecessary. For readers, simply consider the dynamic of conquering and not conquering, alongside the ruler’s resistance to corruption, leading to the accumulation of observations. This way, one can contemplate without letting language impair intent and think beyond the norm. Should anyone question the transmission of emotions and responses through energy, referencing the words of the earlier sages; it is said that the interaction of form influences the response of energy, so energy is indeed capable of responding. How does this relate to your words? It is stated that the teachings of earlier sages, although discussing energy’s responses, stem from the interaction of form. The form refers to the human body, which serves as the primary agent of perception.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>The fifty-seventh difficulty states: How many kinds of &quot;leakage&quot; are there? Are they all named? Yes. There are five types of leakage, each with a different name: gastric leakage, spleen leakage, large intestine leakage, small intestine leakage, and a condition called &quot;heavy posterior&quot; leakage.</p>
<p>Gastric leakage occurs when food does not digest, resulting in a yellow color. </p>
<p>Spleen leakage presents as abdominal distention, fullness, and when food is consumed, it causes vomiting or regurgitation. </p>
<p>Large intestine leakage is characterized by difficulties after eating, with stool appearing white and accompanied by painful intestinal sounds. </p>
<p>Small intestine leakage manifests as urination and bowel movements with pus and blood, accompanied by pain in the lower abdomen.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>The major type of dysentery involves urgent sensations in the abdomen, a heavy feeling in the posterior, frequent attempts to defecate without success, and pain in the genitals. This is the essential method related to the five types of dysentery. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: &quot;Dysentery refers to a blockage, suggesting that it arises from a solidified condition. The term &#39;urgent sensation&#39; indicates pressure within the abdomen, and &#39;heavy feeling in the posterior&#39; refers to a sense of weight at the anus. It is due to this urgency and heaviness that one frequently attempts to defecate but cannot. Pain in the genitals indicates also a lack of ease in urination.&quot;] </p>
<p>[Xie said: &quot;The dysentery of the small and large intestines is what is now referred to as dysentery. The &#39;Inner Canon&#39; states that if the intestines are troubled, leading to dysentery with red or white discharge, moxibustion should be applied to the small intestine points, located below the sixteenth vertebra, one and a half inches on either side, as has been confirmed through many trials.&quot;] </p>
<p>[Chen from Siming said: &quot;Stomach dysentery is also known as &#39;food-related diarrhea.&#39; Spleen dysentery is termed &#39;fluid-related diarrhea.&#39; Large intestine dysentery is referred to as &#39;unblocked diarrhea.&#39; Small intestine dysentery implies that when there is diarrhea, urination occurs first, leading to bloody urine, which is known as &#39;blood dysentery.&#39; Major dysentery relates to intestinal disturbance.&quot;]</p>
<p>The Fifty-Eighth Difficulty states: How many types are there of cold damage? Are there changes in the pulses? Yes. Cold damage has five types: wind attack, cold damage, damp-heat, heat sickness, and warm disease, each with distinct ailments. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: &quot;The term &#39;changes&#39; should be &#39;distinctions,&#39; referring to differentiating the pulses.&quot;] </p>
<p>[Ji said: &quot;Sweating with aversion to wind is called a &#39;wind attack.&#39; Lacking sweat with aversion to cold is called &#39;cold damage.&#39; Severe pain throughout the body, making it impossible to turn over, is termed &#39;damp-heat.&#39; Injury from cold in winter that manifests in summer is termed &#39;heat sickness.&#39; Conditions present at inappropriate times, throughout the year, having similar ailments, are termed &#39;warm disease.&#39;&quot;]<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>The pulse of a stroke is yang, floating and slippery, while yin is moist and weak. The pulse of damp-warmth is yang, floating and weak, while yin is small and rapid. The pulse of cold damage shows both yin and yang robust, tight and rough. The pulse of heat disease presents both yin and yang as floating; it is slippery when floating and scattered and rough when sinking. The pulse of warm disease travels through various channels, without knowing which channel it affects; treatment is based on the location of the pulse.</p>
<p>[Shuo Shou said: The previous discussion was about identifying cold damage; this section discusses the distinction of the pulse, with yin and yang referring to dimensions.]</p>
<p>[Yang said: Warm disease is caused by epidemic qi; it is not simply the cold of winter transforming into warm disease in spring. It spreads through various channels, thus cannot be predicted. One must examine the patient to identify the affected channel and then treat accordingly.]</p>
<p>[Xie said: The &quot;Zhongjing Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states that during severe winter, all creatures hibernate; a gentleman who is careful remains unharmed by the cold, while those who are careless are termed as suffering from cold damage. Any harm from seasonal qi can lead to illness, but cold damage is labeled as a toxin due to its lethal nature. Those who immediately show illness are termed as suffering from cold damage, while those who do not show illness have cold toxins hidden in their skin, which may transform into warm disease in spring or summer disease in summer. Summer disease is characterized by intense heat, exceeding that of warm disease.]<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>It is also said that the yang pulse is floating and slippery, while the yin pulse is moist and weak; when encountering wind, it transforms into wind-heat. According to Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s examples, wind-heat aligns with the pulses described in the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; without mentioning damp-heat. Furthermore, it is said in the &quot;Nan Jing&quot; that warm diseases refer to the warm malaria, wind-heat, warm toxin, and warm epidemic mentioned in Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Shang Han Lun.&quot; The people of Yue discuss its general concept but do not delve into details, while Zhang Zhongjing reveals its secrets and categorizes the pulses, which can be considered thorough. </p>
<p>Pang Anchang in the &quot;General Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states that the &quot;Nan Jing&quot; records five types of cold damage, discussing the pulses of warm diseases found across various channels, but it is unclear which channel&#39;s movement is being referred to, as one should take it according to the location of the channels. According to the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; warm diseases also arise from four types of cold damage that manifest differently. </p>
<p>As Wang Shuhe states, when the yang pulse is floating and slippery, and the yin pulse is moist and weak, if it further encounters wind, it transforms into wind-heat. When the yang pulse is surging and rapid, and the yin pulse is solid and large, if it further encounters damp heat, it transforms into warm toxin; warm toxin is the most severe of diseases. When the yang pulse is moist and weak, and the yin pulse is tense and tight, if it further encounters dampness, it transforms into damp-heat. When both yin and yang pulses are robust but heavily affected by cold, it transforms into warm malaria. These cases exhibit the same diseases under different names and different pulses across various channels, which illustrates the idea of taking it according to the location of the channels. While Pang&#39;s view may not align with the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; it still carries a similar meaning. However, the &quot;Shang Han Lun&quot; discusses warm epidemics without mentioning damp-heat, while Shuhe discusses damp-heat without mentioning warm epidemics; this is indeed a difference.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>In the case of cold damage, there are those who sweat and recover but die upon purging, and others who sweat and die but recover upon purging. What is the reason for this? Indeed. When Yang is deficient and Yin is excess, sweating leads to recovery; purging causes death. Conversely, when Yang is excess and Yin is deficient, sweating leads to death; purging results in recovery. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: When the disease is due to deficiency, it is considered weak; when the disease does not occur, it is seen as excess. It is precisely because of the deficiency that the evil enters; it is only due to excess that the evil cannot infiltrate. This refers to the idea in the &quot;External Treatise&quot; regarding exterior illnesses being harmonized with interior conditions, and interior illnesses being harmonized with exterior conditions, specifically concerning the changes in cold damage. When the exterior illness is harmonized with the interior, sweating can be appropriate, but when purging is done instead, the exterior evil remains, and the interior qi is compromised; when the interior illness is harmonized with the exterior, purging can be appropriate, but when sweating is attempted instead, the interior evil does not subside, and the exterior qi is compromised, resulting in death. Therefore, it is said that sweating can deplete Yang, while purging can harm Yin. The terms Yin and Yang are used here in relation to the exterior and interior. The classics say: &quot;Punishment without exceeding is called great confusion.&quot; Is this what it refers to?]<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>How should one observe the illnesses of cold and heat? Indeed. For skin cold and heat, the skin should not be near the bed, hair scorched, and the nose dry without sweating. For muscle cold and heat, the skin is painful, lips and tongue dry without sweating. For bone cold and heat, the patient finds no comfort, sweat streams incessantly, and teeth are painful and dry.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: &quot;In the twenty-first chapter of &#39;Ling Shu&#39;, it states that for skin cold and heat, one must not be near the bed, with hair scorched, nose dry and unable to sweat. One should take the three yang channels to nourish the hand Tai Yin. For muscle cold and heat, if the muscles ache, hair scorched and lips dry without sweating, one should take the three yang from below to expel the blood, nourishing the Tai Yin to promote sweating. For bone cold and heat, the patient finds no comfort,&quot;]</p>
<p>[I mean that the hundred pulses throughout the body are not well. If sweating is incessant and the teeth are not yet dry, take from the lesser yin channel at the thigh; if the teeth are already dry, it will not be treatable. I humbly note that this is likely an illness of internal injury, associated with similar symptoms. Does Dong Yuan&#39;s &#39;Distinction of Inner and Outer Injuries&#39; indicate its signs here?]<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>The Sixty-Ninth Difficulty discusses how to differentiate between mania and epilepsy. When mania first manifests, there is little sleep accompanied by a lack of hunger. It is characterized by a sense of superiority, discernment of wisdom, arrogance, excessive laughter, enjoyment of singing and music, and incessant wandering. When epilepsy first manifests, there is a lack of joy, rigidity, and a fixed stare, with the pulse showing strength in both yin and yang. </p>
<p>Huashou explains that mania arises from yang; thus, its symptoms are characterized by excess and activity. Epilepsy arises from yin, so its symptoms are characterized by deficiency and stillness. The pulse being strong in both yin and yang indicates that mania drives from yang, leading to a strong yang pulse. Conversely, if epilepsy arises from yin, it results in a strong yin pulse. In the twenty difficulties, the concepts of heavy yang correspond to mania, heavy yin to epilepsy, loss of yang to seeing spirits, and loss of yin to blindness; these should be associated with the discussions above. The term &quot;heavy&quot; should be pronounced like &quot;twice heavy.&quot; </p>
<p>Chen from Siming states that when qi is concentrated in yang, it results in heavy yang; when blood is concentrated in yin, it results in heavy yin. Loss of yang leads to seeing spirits, which indicates qi is not fixed; loss of yin leads to blindness, showing that blood does not nourish. The discussion of mania and epilepsy is detailed in the twenty-first chapter of the Nei Jing, but the Yue people specifically summarize it, likely inviting later generations to seek their own understanding.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>The sixty difficulties state: As for the ailments of the head and heart, there are two types of pain: one is termed &quot;Jue pain&quot; and the other &quot;true pain.&quot; What do these mean? Jue head pain arises when the three Yang meridians of the hands receive cold and wind that lingers and does not dissipate. </p>
<p>As for true head pain, it is characterized by severe pain, with pain penetrating deeply into the brain, and the extremities may turn blue down to the joints; it is hopeless if left untreated. This is because the essence and true energy are concentrated in the brain’s marrow, which should not be afflicted by evil; if afflicted, it leads to death.</p>
<p>When the qi of the five organs interconnects improperly, it is called &quot;Jue heart pain.&quot;<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br>Hua Shou said: &quot;The &#39;Lingshu&#39; records five types of heart pain: stomach heart pain, kidney heart pain, spleen heart pain, liver heart pain, and lung heart pain, all of which are caused by the evil qi of the five organs.&quot;</p>
<p>If the pain is severe but localized in the heart, and the hands and feet appear bluish, it is called true heart pain. True heart pain can cause death by morning if it occurs in the evening, or by evening if it starts in the morning. Hua Shou further explained: &quot;The &#39;Lingshu&#39; states that true heart pain manifests with extreme pain in the heart and bluish coloration of the hands and feet down to the joints. The seventy-first chapter mentions that the lesser yin pertains to the heart vessels, and the heart is the supreme organ in the body. The heart serves as the ruler where the spirit resides; if the organ is robust, evil cannot intrude. If it does intrude, it harms the heart; when the heart is harmed, the spirit departs, and when the spirit departs, death ensues. &#39;True heart pain&#39; should have an omitted character before the word &#39;true&#39;, which indicates a textual omission. The &#39;bluish&#39; of the hands and feet should be understood as &#39;cold&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>The sixty-first difficult question states: &quot;To know through observation is called spirit, to know through hearing is called sage, to know through inquiry is called skilled, and to know through pulse diagnosis is called clever; what does this mean? Indeed, knowing through observation means seeing the five colors to diagnose the illness.&quot; Hua Shou added: &quot;In the &#39;Suwen&#39;, the section on the generation of the five organs states that seeing colors: blue like lush grass indicates death, yellow like bitter orange indicates death, black like charcoal indicates death, red like fresh blood indicates death, and white like dry bones indicates death; these are the manifestations of death in the five colors. Blue like emerald indicates life, red like a rooster&#39;s comb indicates life, yellow like crab belly indicates life, white like pig fat indicates life, and black like crow feathers indicates life; these are the manifestations of life in the five colors.&quot;<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br>Born in the heart, the desire appears as red wrapped in white; born in the lungs, the desire appears as crimson wrapped in white; born in the liver, the desire appears as deep blue wrapped in white; born in the spleen, the desire appears as gourd fruit wrapped in white; born in the kidneys, the desire appears as purple wrapped in white. These are the colors arising from the five organs as external manifestations. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; Chapter 49, it states: black and blue indicate pain, yellow and red indicate heat, and white indicates cold. It also says if red appears on both cheekbones, the size of a thumb, though the sickness is minor, recovery will likely lead to sudden death; if black appears in the yard, the size of a thumb, it will lead to sudden death without illness. Furthermore, Chapter 74 states: when diagnosing blood vessels, much red and much heat indicate issues, much blue and much pain suggest problems, much black indicates chronic numbness, and the appearance of black, red, and blue together indicates cold, heat, and body ache. A slightly yellow complexion, yellow dental plaque, and yellowing nails indicate jaundice. </p>
<p>Similarly, in examining childbirth, if the face is red and the tongue is toxic, the mother lives but the child dies; if the face is blue and the tongue is blue with froth, the mother dies but the child lives; if both lips and mouth are blue, both mother and child die, and so forth.</p>
<p>Yuan commented: the colors of the five organs seen on the face each correspond to parts that reflect their interactions of generation and overcoming, allowing one to observe and understand the illness.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>One who hears and understands can discern the ailments by recognizing the five sounds.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou stated: The Chen family of Siming says that the five viscera have sounds, and these sounds possess different tones. The liver emits a call that corresponds to the &quot;jiao&quot; tone; when it is tuned and aligned, there is no illness; if it is chaotic, the disease lies in the liver. The heart produces a laughter that corresponds to the &quot;zheng&quot; tone; when it is harmonious and prolonged, there is no illness; if it is disordered, the disease lies in the heart. The spleen sings, corresponding to the &quot;gong&quot; tone; when it is large and harmonious, there is no illness; if it is disrupted, the disease lies in the spleen. The lungs emit a cry that corresponds to the &quot;shang&quot; tone; when it is light and vigorous, there is no illness; if it is chaotic, the disease lies in the lungs. The kidneys moan, corresponding to the &quot;yu&quot; tone; when it is deep and profound, there is no illness; if it is disordered, the disease lies in the kidneys.]</p>
<p>[Yuan&#39;s commentary: By hearing the sounds of the five viscera and their corresponding tones, one can distinguish their illnesses based on the clarity or muddiness of these sounds, whether they dominate or are subdued, or exhibit harsh qualities.]</p>
<p>[This section aligns with discussions in the &quot;Suwen&quot; regarding the correspondence of yin and yang, the theories of &quot;Jinkui Zhenyan,&quot; and inquiries about the sounds of the five viscera. Therefore, hearing their sounds is sufficient for discerning ailments.]<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>To understand one&#39;s illness, one should inquire about their cravings for the five flavors, as this reveals the origins and locations of their ailment. </p>
<p>Hua Shou said: &quot;In the sixty-third chapter of the &#39;Ling Shu,&#39; it states that each of the five flavors affects different bodily functions and can lead to various health issues. Sour affects the tendons; excessive consumption can result in urinary problems. Salty affects the blood; too much can lead to thirst. Spicy affects the vital energy; overconsumption may disturb the heart. Since spicy enhances the flow of energy, it also promotes sweating. Bitter affects the bones; consuming too much can lead to nausea. Sweet affects the flesh; overindulgence may cause a heavy feeling in the heart. From this, one can understand that asking about cravings for the five flavors helps identify the source of their ailments.&quot;</p>
<p>Yuan&#39;s remark: &quot;If one shows a strong preference or excessive consumption of a particular flavor among the five, it indicates an imbalance in the organ energies, revealing a tendency towards deficiency or excess.&quot;<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>To know through palpation, one examines the radial pulse, observing its vacuity and solidity to discern the illness and identify which organ is affected. </p>
<p>【Hua Shou says: Examining the radial pulse relates to the First Difficulty. Observing vacuity and solidity allows one to encounter the Six Difficulties and the Forty-Eight Difficulties. Wang&#39;s Treatise on Pulse states: There are three divisions of pulse, namely, the cun (inch), chi (palm), and guan (bar). The flow of nourishing and guarding energy remains balanced. The kidney pulse is deep, the heart is surging, the lung is superficial, and the liver is taut. This adheres to the regular classics, without losing precision. Movements in rising and descending, the pulse revolving around itself. Water beneath a hundred beats, the pulse encircling the whole body. When returning to the cun, the vacuity and solidity are revealed. This is what is meant.】</p>
<p>It is said that knowledge from external signs is called sage, while knowledge from internal signs is called spirit; this refers to the same concept. </p>
<p>【Hua Shou says: Knowing externally refers to observation and listening; knowing internally refers to inquiry and palpation. The spirit is subtle; the sage is clear and insightful. To summarize, the terms sage and spirit suggest that skill is within.】</p>
<p>In the Sixty-Two Difficulties it is stated: the five organs have five wells and streams, while the six bowels alone have six; what does this mean? Indeed. The bowels are yang, and the three jiaos (heaters) operate among the yang, thus one additional point is established, named yuan (source). The six for the bowels also share a single qi with the three jiaos. </p>
<p>【Hua Shou says: The five organs&#39; wells and streams signify the junction of channels. The six bowels&#39; wells and streams involve the three jiaos&#39; operation among the yang, hence an additional point is established, named yuan. Therefore, the six for the bowels share a single qi with the three jiaos.】 </p>
<p>【Yu&#39;s commentary states: This text seems to have errors and should be cross-referenced with the Sixty-Six Difficulties.】<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>The sixty-third difficulty states: Why are the ten transformations associated with the five organs and six bowels initiated with &quot;井&quot; (well)? Indeed. &quot;井&quot; represents the spring of the East, the beginning of all things. At this time, all creatures stir and breathe; every living thing is born with the spring. Therefore, the numbering of the years starts in spring, and the numbering of the days begins with &quot;甲&quot; (the first of the heavenly stems). Thus, “井” is regarded as the starting point.</p>
<p>【Hua Shou says: The twelve channels&#39; points are all called &quot;井&quot; (well), and, seeing that “井” is associated with the beginning of the &quot;荥&quot; (bladder meridian) and &quot;俞&quot; (source points), it&#39;s because &quot;井&quot; governs the Eastern wood, and wood symbolizes spring, the start of all things. The creatures moving are &quot;行&quot; (to walk), &quot;喘&quot; (to breathe), which means inhaling and exhaling. Gong Sun Hong&#39;s transmission states &quot;蚑行喙息,&quot; clarifying the meaning. “蜎” signifies flying, while “蠕” pertains to crawling, and both belong to the category of insects. All living things are engendered with spring; hence the counting of years begins with spring, and the counting of days commences with &quot;甲,&quot; making the “荥” convergence of humans start with &quot;井&quot; as well.】</p>
<p>【Feng says: &quot;井&quot; (well) refers to the well from which springs emerge.】</p>
<p>【Chen from Siming says: The energy of the channels is generated, starting from &quot;井,&quot; then flowing into &quot;荥,&quot; &quot;俞,&quot; passing through channels and converging, thus using the origins of all things, years, and days as a metaphor.】<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>The sixty-fourth difficulty states: The ten transformations further describe yin wells as wood and yang wells as gold; yin rivers as fire and yang rivers as water; yin soil as earth and yang soil as wood; yin channels as gold and yang channels as fire; yin unions as water and yang unions as earth. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The twelve channels originate from the well cavities. Yin wells correspond to wood, hence yin well wood generates yin river fire, yin river fire generates yin soil earth, yin soil earth generates yin channel gold, and yin channel gold generates yin union water. Yang wells correspond to gold, thus yang well gold generates yang river water, yang river water generates yang soil wood, yang soil wood generates yang channel fire, and yang channel fire generates yang union earth.]<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br>Yin and Yang are indeed different; what does this mean? It relates to the concepts of hardness and softness. Yin corresponds to the Wood of乙, while Yang corresponds to the Metal of庚. The Yang庚, being庚, represents the hardness of乙; while the Yin乙, being乙, represents the softness of庚.乙 signifies Wood, hence it is referred to as Yin井木;庚 signifies Metal, hence it is referred to as Yang井金. The others follow this pattern.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou states: Hardness and softness refer to the pairing of乙 and庚. The reason we speak of the ten stems in terms of乙 and庚 is that all vital organs and acupuncture points begin at井. The Yin meridian井 starts with乙木, and the Yang meridian井 starts with庚金, which is why we refer to the pairing of hardness and softness with乙庚, with the other five elements following suit.]</p>
<p>[Ding remarks: Hardness and softness refer to Yin井木 and Yang井金, where庚金 is hard and乙木 is soft; Yin荥火 and Yang荥水, where壬水 is hard and丁火 is soft; Yin俞土 and Yang俞木, where甲木 is hard and己土 is soft; Yin经金 and Yang经火, where丙火 is hard and辛金 is soft; Yin合水 and Yang合土, where戊土 is hard and癸水 is soft. The principle of the five elements reflects the mother-child relationship in generation, and the husband-wife relationship in overcoming and controlling. Therefore, the path of the husband is always hard, and the path of the wife is always soft; this is the natural order. The Book of Changes states: dividing Yin and Yang and alternating between softness and hardness; is this not the essence of it?]<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>The sixty-fifth difficulty states: The classic says that what emerges is the well, and what enters is the union. What is the principle behind this? Indeed. What emerges is the well; the well represents the spring of the East, the beginning of all things coming to life, which is why it is said that what emerges is the well. What enters is the union; the union represents the winter of the North, where the yang energy enters and is stored, which is why it is said that what enters is the union. 【Hua Shou says: This refers to the beginning and end of the flow of the classic&#39;s channels.】<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>The sixty-sixth difficulty states: The origin of the lungs is at Taiyuan, the origin of the heart is at Tailing, the origin of the liver is at Taichong, the origin of the spleen is at Taibai, the origin of the kidneys is at Taixi, the origin of the Shaoyin is at Duoguo (also known as Shenmen), the origin of the gallbladder is at Qiuxu, the origin of the stomach is at Chongyang, the origin of the Sanjiao is at Yangchi, the origin of the bladder is at Jinggu, the origin of the large intestine is at Hegu, and the origin of the small intestine is at Wanggu. </p>
<p>[Shuaishou notes: The lung&#39;s original point is Taiyuan, up to the kidney&#39;s original point at Taixi, as seen in the first chapter of the &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; The second chapter states: the lung&#39;s point is Taiyuan, the heart&#39;s point is Tailing, the liver&#39;s point is Taichong, the spleen&#39;s point is Taibai, the kidney&#39;s point is Taixi. The bladder&#39;s point is Shugu, passing Jinggu to be the origin; the gallbladder&#39;s point is Linqi, passing Qiuxu to be the origin; the stomach&#39;s point is Xiangu, passing Chongyang to be the origin; the Sanjiao&#39;s point is Zhongzhu, passing Yangchi to be the origin; the small intestine&#39;s point is Houxi, passing Wanggu to be the origin; the large intestine&#39;s point is Sanjian, passing Hegu to be the origin. The five yin organs have their original points defined by their points, while the six yang organs also have points, yet still have separate origins.]<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>Some say that the &quot;Lingshu&quot; identifies Tai Ling as the source of the heart, and the &quot;Nanjing&quot; agrees, but also distinguishes the Dui Gu as the source of the lesser yin. Various acupuncture texts treat Tai Ling as the acupuncture point for the hand jueyin heart master, while the Shen Men, located at the end of the Dui Gu on the palm&#39;s back, is understood as the point associated with the heart. What accounts for such differences?</p>
<p>According to the seventy-first chapter of the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; if the lesser yin has no outflow, does the heart not suffer? Qibo replies that while the exterior channels are ill, the organs are not ill, hence the focus on the channel at the back of the hand, at the Dui Gu. The other channels rise and fall, with variable speed, similar to the course of the hand lesser yin heart channel. Furthermore, the second chapter states that the heart emerges from Zhong Chong, flows through Lao Gong, reaches Tai Ling, travels through Jian Shi, and enters Qu Ze, coinciding with the hand lesser yin. It follows that points below Zhong Chong are part of the hand heart master channel, and the &quot;Lingshu&quot; explicitly identifies them as hand lesser yin, without separately listing the specific points of the hand lesser yin channel.</p>
<p>Moreover, the &quot;Suwen&quot; in the section on needle techniques states: needle the end of the hand heart master lesser yin at the Dui Gu, and then one achieves immediate results. In the section on Qi points, it indicates that the five organ points total fifty, with Wang&#39;s commentary noting only the heart protector channel&#39;s well point, without mentioning the heart channel&#39;s well point. Lastly, the seventy-ninth difficulty states: if the heart is ill, drain the hand heart master point, and tonify the hand heart master well point. A thorough examination of the texts shows that the hand lesser yin and the heart master are treated similarly.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>The twelve meridians are all based on the concept of &quot;yu&quot; (acupoints); why is that? Indeed. The &quot;yu&quot; of the five organs is where the three jiaos operate, where qi is retained and stopped. What is the basis for the &quot;yu&quot; that the three jiaos carry? Indeed. The moving qi between the kidneys below the navel is the essence of human life and the foundation of the twelve meridians; thus, it is called the &quot;yuan&quot; (origin). The three jiaos serve as the special envoy of the &quot;yuan&quot; qi, governing the circulation of the three types of qi, which traverse the five organs and six cavities. The &quot;yuan&quot; is the esteemed title of the three jiaos; therefore, wherever it stops, it is known as the &quot;yuan.&quot; In cases where the five organs and six cavities are diseased, all can be traced back to this &quot;yuan.&quot; </p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: The twelve meridians all rely on &quot;yu&quot; as the foundation because the &quot;yu&quot; of each meridian is connected to the operations of the three jiaos, where qi is retained and stopped. The &quot;yu&quot; that the three jiaos carry is called &quot;yuan,&quot; as the moving qi between the kidneys below the navel is indeed the essence of life and the root of the twelve meridians. The three jiaos serve as the special envoy of the &quot;yuan&quot; qi, governing the circulation of the upper, middle, and lower types of qi, which travel through the five organs and six cavities. The circulation of the three types of qi can be understood as the essence of the true original qi from the lower jiao, known as &quot;yuan&quot; qi, which ascends to the middle jiao. The middle jiao receives the essence of water and grains, transforming it into nourishing and protective qi. This nourishing and protective qi communicates with the true original qi and reaches the upper jiao. Thus, &quot;yuan&quot; is the esteemed title of the three jiaos, and wherever it stops, it is referred to as the &quot;yuan,&quot; much like how the authorities are referred to in their official titles when they travel. The origin of diseases in the five organs and six cavities is based on this principle. How appropriate!]<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>The sixty-seventh difficulty states: The five organ &quot;mu&quot; points are all located in the yin, while the &quot;shu&quot; points are in the yang. What does this mean? Indeed, when yin diseases manifest, they act like yang, and when yang diseases manifest, they act like yin. Hence, the &quot;mu&quot; points are in the yin, and the &quot;shu&quot; points are in the yang. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou explains: &quot;Mu&quot; and &quot;shu&quot; refer to the collective name for the empty cavities of the five organs. When located in the abdomen, it is called &quot;mu&quot;; when in the back, it is called &quot;shu.&quot; &quot;Mu&quot; indicates the collection of qi at this point. In the &quot;Biography of Bian Que,&quot; &quot;shu&quot; is written as &quot;shu,&quot; meaning to disperse, indicating the qi moves from here to there. The &quot;mu&quot; points of the five organs in the abdomen are: the lung &quot;mu&quot; at the middle palace point, located one inch below the chest&#39;s cloud gate, between the second ribs; the heart &quot;mu&quot; at the giant hollow point, located one inch below the end of the sternum; the spleen &quot;mu&quot; at the chapter gate, located below the rib cage straight to the navel; the liver &quot;mu&quot; at the timely gate, located one and a half inches on either side of the center; and the kidney &quot;mu&quot; at the capital gate, located in the lower back beneath the rib cage. The &quot;shu&quot; points of the five organs in the back are along the Gallbladder and Urinary Bladder channels: the lung &quot;shu&quot; is found below the third vertebra, the heart &quot;shu&quot; below the fifth, the liver &quot;shu&quot; below the ninth, the spleen &quot;shu&quot; below the eleventh, and the kidney &quot;shu&quot; below the fourteenth, all located an inch and a half on either side of the spine. </p>
<p>Yin diseases manifesting as yang and yang diseases as yin indicates that the qi of the yin and yang meridians intersect, linking the organs and abdomen with the back, allowing for communication. Therefore, sometimes yin diseases act like yang, and sometimes yang diseases act like yin. The acupuncture method states: lead from yang to yin, and lead from yin to yang.]<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>The sixty-eighth difficulty states: The five viscera and the six bowels all have the channels of well, source, and accumulation, each presiding over different functions. Now, it is said in the channels that the well represents the origin, the source represents the flow, the accumulation represents the storage, the channel represents the function, and the merger represents the entry. The well governs fullness below the heart, the source governs heat in the body, the accumulation governs heavy and painful joints, the channel governs cough and cold symptoms, and the merger governs counterflow and leakage. These are the diseases presided over by the well, source, accumulation, channel, and merger of the five viscera and six bowels. </p>
<p>【Hua Shou states: To &quot;preside&quot; means to treat. The well represents the source from which water emerges. The source refers to small water flows. Since the original well is subtle, the flow is small and therefore becomes the source. Accumulation refers to transport and storage; it is the result of the source’s flow, thus it is called accumulation. From accumulation to passing through, it is called the channel. From the channel to entering into the merger, it is called the merger, which signifies convergence.】<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br>The first section of the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; states: The five zang organs correspond to five points, making a total of twenty-five points; the six fu organs correspond to six points, totalling thirty-six points. [These points refer to the general name for empty cavities. All empty cavities can be referred to as points.] There are twelve primary channels and fifteen collateral channels, making a total of twenty-seven pathways through which qi flows, all linked to the jing, ying, and points, with each associated with different diseases: The jing point corresponds to fullness below the heart, related to liver wood diseases; the ying point corresponds to body heat, related to heart fire diseases; the shu point corresponds to heaviness and joint pain, related to spleen earth diseases; the channel point corresponds to coughing, wheezing, and fluctuating cold and heat, related to lung metal diseases; and the he point corresponds to rebellious qi and leakage, related to kidney water diseases. 【Xie observed: This lists one example of each zang organ&#39;s disease, and other diseases can be inferred similarly. The six fu organs are not mentioned since the discussion of the zang is sufficient to encompass them.】<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br>The sixty-ninth difficulty states: The classics say that the deficient should be supplemented, the excess should be drained; for that which is neither deficient nor excessive, one should treat it according to the classics. What does this mean? Indeed, the deficient is supplemented by its mother, while the excess is drained from its child. One should first supplement and then drain. For that which is neither deficient nor excessive, treating it according to the classics means that the vital channels themselves are sick, not due to external evils; thus, one should cultivate their own channels, hence the phrase &quot;treating it according to the classics.&quot;</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: In the tenth chapter of &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; it states that for all twelve channels, if they are excessive, drain them; if they are deficient, supplement them; if they are neither excessive nor deficient, treat them according to the classics. The deficient is supplemented by its mother, while the excess is drained from its child; the child can make the mother excessive, and the mother can make the child deficient. For instance, if there is a deficiency in the liver, one should supplement the Jueyin channel; this would be Ququan. If excessive, one should drain the Jueyin channel; this would be Xingjian. One should first supplement and then drain. This refers to conditions of Yang qi being insufficient and Yin qi being excessive; one should first supplement the Yang before draining the Yin. However, this meaning does not belong here; it is either a mistake or a misinterpretation. When it states that it is neither excessive nor deficient and should be treated according to the classics, it pertains to the vital channels’ own sickness, when one is grieved or overly concerned, affecting the heart, or when suffering from cold and consuming cold drinks, which hurts the lungs, and so forth.]</p>
<p>[Yang said: Neither excessive nor deficient means that the organs do not conflict with each other, thus it is said to cultivate one’s own channels.]<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>The &quot;Seventy Difficulties&quot; states: In spring and summer, acupuncture should be shallow, while in autumn and winter, it should be deep. What does this mean? Indeed, in spring and summer, the yang energy is upward, and so is the human vitality; thus, the needle should be inserted shallowly to avoid excessive penetration. In autumn and winter, the yang energy is downward, and so is the human vitality; therefore, the needle should be inserted deeply to ensure it reaches the necessary depth. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: In spring and summer, the yang energy is superficial and ascendant, and so is human vitality; hence, acupuncture should be shallow, aiming for moderation. In autumn and winter, the yang energy is heavy and descending, and so is human vitality; thus, acupuncture should be deep, ensuring sufficient reach. The classics state: &quot;One must first consider the seasonal energies and not disturb the heavenly harmony,&quot; which refers to this principle.]</p>
<p>[From the Chen family of Siming: In spring, the energy resides in the hair, in summer, in the skin, in autumn, in the flesh, and in winter, in the bone marrow; this corresponds to the principles of shallow and deep acupuncture.]<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br>In spring and summer, the attainment of one yin is essential; similarly, in autumn and winter, the attainment of one yang is necessary. What does this mean? Indeed, in spring and summer, the warmth must lead to one yin; this is achieved by initially needling deeply until reaching the kidney and liver regions to collect and hold the yin energy. Conversely, in autumn and winter, the cold must lead to one yang; this begins with shallow and superficial needling at the heart and lung areas to push and foster the yang energy inward.</p>
<p>Thus, it is said that spring and summer must yield one yin, while autumn and winter must yield one yang. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou commented: In spring and summer, the warm energy necessarily leads to one yin, which means nurturing yang during these seasons. When needles are first inserted deeply to the kidney and liver regions, one awaits the gathering of energy before withdrawing and lifting the needle to the heart and lung regions, which is referred to as attaining one yin. In autumn and winter, the cold energy naturally leads to one yang, which signifies nurturing yin during these times. Initially, the needle is inserted shallow and superficially at the heart and lung areas, awaiting the collection of energy before pushing the needle further in to reach the kidney and liver regions, hence achieving one yang. This commentary on yin and yang reflects a principle particularly emphasized by the practitioners from the regions beyond. In all acupuncture practices, there are appropriate methods for reinforcement or depletion, and one does not need to be overly bound by these guidelines.]<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>The Seventy-First Difficulty states: The classics say that to needle the &quot;rong&quot; (nourishment) does not harm the &quot;wei&quot; (defensive), and to needle the &quot;wei&quot; does not harm the &quot;rong.&quot; What does this mean? Indeed, when needling the yang, one lies down and needles it; when needling the yin, one first uses the left hand to press on the place of the &quot;rong&quot; point to disperse the energy before inserting the needle. This is what is meant by needling &quot;rong&quot; without harming &quot;wei,&quot; and needling &quot;wei&quot; without harming &quot;rong.&quot;</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: &quot;Rong&quot; is yin, and &quot;wei&quot; is yang. &quot;Rong&quot; flows in the channels, while &quot;wei&quot; flows outside the channels, each having its own depth and shallowness. The method of using needles is likewise. For yang, one must lie down and needle it because yang energy is light and buoyant; if forced too much, it may harm the &quot;rong.&quot; When needling yin, one must first press on the point for a long time to allow the energy to disperse before inserting the needle; otherwise, it may harm the &quot;wei.&quot; &quot;No&quot; and &quot;do not&quot; are prohibitive terms.]<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>The seventy-two difficulties state: The classics say that one can know the incoming and outgoing energies, which allows for regulation. The method of regulating these energies must lie within yin and yang; what does this mean? Indeed. The so-called incoming and outgoing refers to understanding the flow of nourishing and protective energies, as well as the movement of meridians, taking into account their reversal and alignment, thus it is called incoming and outgoing.</p>
<p>【Hua Shou said: The method of incoming and outgoing is also the path of supplementation and draining. To &#39;incoming&#39; is to seize it by welcoming it, while to &#39;outgoing&#39; is to follow its course and assist it. However, one must know the flow of nourishing and protective energies and the movement of the meridians. The flow of nourishing and protective energies and the movement of meridians are fundamentally one. Only by understanding this can one observe the condition of illness in terms of reversal and alignment and accordingly do supplementation or draining.】</p>
<p>【The Chen family of Siming said: To &#39;incoming&#39; is to welcome the energy while it is still coming and has not become abundant, in order to drain it; to &#39;outgoing&#39; is to follow the energy while it is still outgoing and has not become depleted, in order to supplement it. I humbly note that incoming and outgoing can be divided into two types: the incoming and outgoing of vacuity and fullness, and the incoming and outgoing of mother and child. The Chen family&#39;s explanation pertains to vacuity and fullness, whereas the content of the seventy-ninth difficulty pertains to mother and child.】<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>The method of regulating qi must be based on the principles of yin and yang, understanding its inner and outer aspects, and adjusting accordingly. Therefore, it is said that the method of regulating qi must rely on yin and yang. </p>
<p>Hua Shou states: the inner is yin, the outer is yang, the surface is yang, and the interior is yin. One observes whether the illness lies in yin or yang and adjusts accordingly. </p>
<p>Yang&#39;s perspective is that in the method of regulating qi, one must rely on yin and yang: if yin is deficient and yang is abundant, then tonify yin and drain yang; if yang is deficient and yin is abundant, then tonify yang and drain yin. Sometimes yang may overlap with yin, and sometimes yin may overlap with yang; or both may be deficient or abundant, all adjusting according to what is observed.</p>
<p>Xie states: men are external and women are internal; the surface is yang and the interior is yin. When regulating the energies of yin and yang, one draws from yang to influence yin, and from yin to influence yang. A disease of yang is treated with yin, and a disease of yin is treated with yang.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>The seventy-third difficulty states: The points known as &quot;Jing&quot; are located in areas where the skin and muscles are shallow, and the qi is insufficient to facilitate their use. How should one treat these points? Indeed, the Jing points represent wood, while the Ying points represent fire. Fire is the child of wood; therefore, when needling Jing points, one must use Ying to dispel. Hence, the classic says that those who supplement cannot induce a purge, and those who purge cannot supplement—this is what is meant. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The Jing points discussed in various classics are found at the tips of the fingers and toes, where the skin and muscles are shallow and qi is insufficient for replenishment or purging. Therefore, when needling Jing points, one should only disperse through Ying, treating Jing as wood and Ying as fire, since fire is the child of wood. The detailed commentary from the Yue people is specifically about purging from Jing points. If one were to supplement Jing points, one must appropriately supplement the He points. Thus, the classic states that those who supplement cannot induce a purge, and those who purge cannot supplement; each has its appropriate application. If supplementation and purging are reversed, the illness may worsen, leading to the troubling state of having real and false conditions—should one not be cautious?]<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>The Seventy-Fourth Difficulty states: The classics say, in spring one punctures the Jing, in summer the Ying, at the late summer the Shu, in autumn the Jing, and in winter the He. What do these mean? Indeed, to puncture the Jing in spring relates to evil in the liver; to puncture the Ying in summer relates to evil in the heart; to puncture the Shu in late summer relates to evil in the spleen; to puncture the Jing in autumn relates to evil in the lungs; and to puncture the He in winter relates to evil in the kidneys. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The intertwining of the four seasons with the channels relates to the fact that each evil has its own location.]</p>
<p>Why are the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys connected to spring, summer, autumn, and winter? Indeed, when one of the five organs is ill, it manifests in five colors. For example, if the liver is sick: the color green relates to the liver, a foul odor relates to the liver, a craving for sour food relates to the liver, a desire to shout relates to the liver, and a tendency to weep relates to the liver. There are many conditions, too numerous to detail. There are seasonal cycles, all intertwined with spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The subtlety of acupuncture lies in the minutiae of these seasons. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The maladies of the five organs are not limited to five; they are indeed numerous. Although there are many, they are still tied to the seasons, hence the illnesses correspond to spring, summer, autumn, winter, and the Jing, Ying, Shu, Jing, and He channels. The acupuncturist must carefully observe these conditions.] </p>
<p>[Upon examining the meaning of this text, it seems there may be some omissions; however, we will interpret it as such, awaiting further clarification from knowledgeable individuals.]<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>The 75th difficulty states: The classics say that the East is substantial, the West is empty, the South drains, and the North supplements. What does this mean? Indeed. Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth should balance each other. The East represents wood, and the West represents gold. Wood desires to be substantial; gold should balance it. Fire desires to be substantial; water should balance it. Earth desires to be substantial; wood should balance it. Gold desires to be substantial; fire should balance it. Water desires to be substantial; earth should balance it. The East corresponds to the liver, so we know the liver is substantial; the West corresponds to the lungs, so we know the lungs are empty. The South drains fire, and the North supplements water. Fire in the South is the child of wood; water in the North is the mother of wood. Water overcomes fire; the child can make the mother substantial, while the mother can make the child empty. Hence, draining fire and supplementing water aims to prevent gold from balancing wood. The classics say that if one cannot address their emptiness, what is there to say about the rest? This is what it means. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: Gold cannot balance wood; the character &quot;not&quot; may be a misreading. The East is substantial, the West is empty, draining the South and supplementing the North indicates that wood, gold, fire, and water seek to balance each other. The desires of wood, fire, earth, gold, and water to be substantial, and the greed of the five elements is controlled and moderated; the balance of gold, water, wood, fire, and earth curbs that greed.]<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>The text states: When one organ is excessive, it should be balanced by the opposing one. The east corresponds to the liver, the west to the lungs; if the liver is excessive, it is known that the lungs are deficient. If the lungs are not deficient, how could the liver be excessively full? Whether to drain or to supplement, one must temper the excess and remedy the deficiency; this is the way to correct extremes. Water can overcome fire; the son can make the mother full, and the mother can make the son deficient. To drain the southern fire is to take away the energy of the child, allowing the mother to have more; to supplement the northern water is to increase the energy of the child so that it does not rely on the mother. In this way, the excess retreats and the deficiency progresses, allowing metal to balance wood, thus preventing the east and west from experiencing skewed advantages or disadvantages. The view of the Yue people generally suggests that the east is overly full while the west is lacking; hence, fire is drained to suppress wood and water is supplemented to support metal, allowing metal to achieve balance with wood. If one were to desire metal not to balance wood, the preceding and following text would contradict each other and the argument would be incoherent. If the liver&#39;s wood is not excessive and the lungs are not deficient, then to drain fire and supplement water is nearly to mix fullness and deficiency. The discussions of the eighty-one difficulties align with this concept. The Cai family of Jiufeng states that water, fire, metal, wood, and earth should mutually control each other to drain excess; their intent is likewise the same.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>Thus, the concluding statement reads: if one cannot govern the emptiness, why ask about the rest? This serves as a warning for those who understand the constant yet not the variable. The main idea of this text is about the liver being solid and the lungs being weak, focusing on draining fire and supplementing water.</p>
<p>Someone might ask: if the son can solidify the mother, and the mother can weaken the son, should we then drain fire and supplement earth? The reasoning is that when the son is abundant, he does not draw from the mother&#39;s energy, while if the mother is insufficient, she cannot nourish her son. By draining the southern fire, one deprives the son of energy, allowing the mother to be more abundant; by supplementing the central earth, one enhances the mother’s energy, ensuring her ability to nurture her son. Now, why drain fire and supplement water? It is said: this is the brilliance of the Yue people, achieving two benefits with one action. </p>
<p>Moreover, draining fire serves to seize the energy of wood and to eliminate the dominance of metal; supplementing water assists in nourishing the energy of metal while controlling the brilliance of fire. If we were to supplement earth, it would solely aid metal and cannot serve dual purposes, which is why we supplement water instead of earth. </p>
<p>Another question may arise: can the mother not make the son solid, and the son make the mother weak, according to the principles of the five elements? Yet, the Yue people assert that the son can solidify the mother and the mother can weaken the son. Why is this? It is said: each has its own interpretation.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>The mother can make the child substantial, and the child can make the mother empty; this is the generation and transformation of the Five Elements. If the child can make the mother substantial, and the mother can make the child empty, this refers to the gain and loss in the practice of acupuncture, and they are indeed not the same. The Chen family of Siming states: Zhang Zhongjing says: &quot;Wood overcomes Metal,&quot; which is called &quot;Horizontal.&quot; The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: &quot;When Qi is excessive, it controls what it triumphs over, and insults what it cannot overcome.&quot; When Wood is substantial and Metal is empty, it implies Wood is horizontal and overcomes Metal, thus it insults what cannot be overcome. Wood is originally balanced by Metal, but due to its strong Qi, it becomes horizontal. If Metal balances it, they do not suppress each other and combat ensues; in battle, both the substantial and the empty suffer losses. Metal, being empty, relies on Qi from Earth; however, at that moment Earth is also constrained and cannot sufficiently support it. Thus, Water is seen as the child of Metal and the mother of Wood; hence, it drains Fire and supplements Water, allowing Water to overcome Fire. Consequently, Fire weakens and draws Qi from Wood, thus Wood diminishes and does not become substantial again. Water, as the mother of Wood, can indeed make the child empty. Once Wood is not substantial, its Qi is balanced; when balanced, Metal avoids being overrun by Wood and does not become empty again. Water, being the child of Metal, can indeed make the mother substantial. The saying that Metal cannot balance Wood, and cannot directly use Metal to balance Wood, must drain Fire and supplement Water, treating it indirectly, so that the Qi of Wood and Metal naturally balances each other. According to Chen&#39;s statement, there is logic in it; however, for the one word &quot;not,&quot; it is entangled and overly strained, not as direct as simply using &quot;not&quot; as an extension of the text. In recognizing the 81 chapters, one can see the phrase &quot;Metal balances Wood&quot; clearly.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>The seventy-sixth difficulty asks: What is meant by tonification and depletion? When tonifying, what energy is to be taken? When depleting, what energy is to be placed? Indeed, when tonifying, one takes energy from the protective aspect; when depleting, one places energy in the nourishing aspect. If there is a deficiency of yang energy and an excess of yin energy, one should first tonify the yang and then deplete the yin; if there is a deficiency of yin energy and an excess of yang energy, one should first tonify the yin and then deplete the yang. The communication between the nourishing and protective aspects is essential.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou commented: &quot;In the &#39;Lingshu&#39; chapter fifty-two, it states that the floating energy not following the meridians is what is referred to as protective energy, while the essence energy that circulates through the meridians is the nourishing energy. Thus, for tonification, one takes the floating energy not following the meridians to replenish areas of deficiency; for depletion, energy is placed from the nourishing aspect without use. &#39;Place&#39; here means to abandon or set aside. However, a person&#39;s illness does not uniformly manifest, and the methods of tonification and depletion are not singular either. Therefore, if there is a deficiency of yang energy while yin energy is in excess, first tonify the yang and then deplete the yin to harmonize; if there is a deficiency of yin energy while yang energy is in excess, first tonify the yin and then deplete the yang to harmonize. In this way, the communication between the nourishing and protective aspects will naturally occur. The methods of tonification and depletion will be discussed in the next chapter.&quot;]<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>The seventy-seventh difficulty states: The classics say that the superior physician treats the disease before it manifests, while the intermediate physician treats the disease after it has appeared; what does this mean? Indeed. Treating the disease before it manifests means that upon seeing a liver-related illness, one recognizes that the liver&#39;s influence affects the spleen. Therefore, one should first strengthen the spleen’s energy, preventing the liver&#39;s pathogenic influence from taking hold. Hence, it is said to treat the disease before it manifests. The intermediate physician, when seeing liver illness, does not understand the connection to the spleen and focuses solely on treating the liver; thus, it is said to treat the already manifested disease.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: When observing liver illness, the superior physician first strengthens the spleen to prevent the pathogen from entering, which is to treat the disease before it manifests. When the intermediate physician sees liver illness and focuses solely on treating the liver, it is to treat the already manifested disease. The &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; chapter fifty-five, states: The superior physician needles what has not yet developed; next, one needles what has not yet become severe; then, one needles what has already weakened. The inferior physician needles what is currently active, or what appears to be at its peak, or what has a disease that opposes the pulse. Therefore, one should avoid injuring when the condition is strong; needling a weakened condition requires careful effort. Hence, it is said that the superior physician treats the disease before it manifests, not the already manifested disease; this is what it refers to.]<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>The seventy-eighth difficulty states: &quot;There is a distinction between tonifying and draining, what does this mean?&quot; Indeed. The methods of tonification and draining do not necessarily require the expulsion of the internal needle during breathing. Those who understand needles trust their left, while those who do not trust their right. When needling, first use the left hand to press and hold down on the area being needled. Then flick and nudge it, grasping and directing the energy as if mimicking the shape of an artery, inserting the needle in the same direction. If you obtain the energy, push it inward, which is called tonification; if you cause it to move and extend, that is called draining. Failing to obtain the energy equates to an irretrievable condition akin to a man outside and a woman inside. Failing to obtain energy is known as &quot;ten deaths with no remedy.&quot; [Note: &quot;Nudge&quot; is pronounced like &quot;anger.&quot;] [Huashou commented: To flick and nudge is to encourage the energy; grasping and directing it slightly heavier is intended to guide the energy to reach. When the energy arrives below the fingers, resembling the shape of an artery, one then takes action to needle it. &quot;Following&quot; corresponds to &quot;bearing,&quot; while &quot;taking advantage&quot; refers to &quot;seizing.&quot; Stopping the needle to wait for energy means waiting until the energy arrives and causes the needle to move, which indicates obtaining the energy.]<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>To push the needle inward is called &quot;tonification.&quot; To move the needle and extend it outward is called &quot;sedation.&quot; This is the heart technique of the Yue people, not the respiratory method from the inside out. This is indeed the case. If the needle is held still while waiting for qi, and it does not arrive for a long time, then with a man, the needle should be inserted more superficially to feel for the wei qi. With a woman, it should be inserted more deeply to feel for the rong qi. If, after this, qi is still not obtained, it is said that the illness is ultimately untreatable. The text uses the term &quot;qi&quot; differently in its earlier and later sections; this must not be confused. The earlier mention of qi coming resembles the state of an artery, and refers to the qi felt by the left hand before needling. The later mention of obtaining or not obtaining qi pertains to what is felt under the needle itself; these are two separate sections. Zhou Zhongli said: In all cases of feeling for qi, the left hand should apply slight pressure. If qi cannot be felt, then with a man, lighten the touch on the wei qi to feel it; with a woman, apply more pressure on the rong qi to feel it. Thus, if there is no distinction between before and after, and the method of waiting for qi with the needle is misunderstood, what basis is there for differentiating between tonification and sedation?<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>The seventy-ninth difficulty states: The classics say that in welcoming one and taking from another, how can there be no emptiness? In following through and aiding, how can there be no substance? Emptiness and substance, as if gained or lost; substance and emptiness, as if present or absent—what does this mean? </p>
<p>【Hua Shou states: This is from the first chapter of the &quot;Lingshu.&quot; Gain refers to seeking and obtaining. Loss refers to letting go or leaving behind. In the second chapter it says: &#39;To speak of substance and emptiness, as if present or absent,&#39; refers to substance having essence and emptiness lacking it. Speaking of emptiness and substance, as if gained or lost, refers to those who supplement feeling as if they have gained, and those who release feeling as if they have lost. This aligns with the meaning of the first chapter.】<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>Indeed. To &quot;welcome and seize&quot; refers to draining its offspring; to &quot;follow and assist&quot; refers to replenishing its mother. For example, if the heart is afflicted, one drains the heart’s hand region, which is called &quot;welcoming and seizing&quot;; to replenish the hand’s heart region is called &quot;following and assisting.&quot; </p>
<p>[Hua Shou states: &quot;Welcoming and seizing&quot; indicates draining, while &quot;following and assisting&quot; indicates replenishing. In the case of heart disease, the heart represents fire. The earth is the offspring of fire, with the hand’s heart region being the location Tai Ling. Draining it is to &#39;welcome and seize.&#39; Wood is the mother of fire, and the hand’s heart region being the location Zhong Chong. Replenishing it is to &#39;follow and assist.&#39; &#39;Welcoming&#39; refers to approaching from the front, while &#39;following&#39; means going from behind. This is an example concerning the heart, and the draining and replenishing refers specifically to the hand&#39;s heart region, as mentioned in the &#39;Spiritual Pivot&#39; regarding the absence of point Shao Yin. It should be considered alongside the challenges of sixty-six.]</p>
<p>The so-called attainment and deficiency refer to the concept of being firmly grounded versus being permeable. Firm and solid presence of qi signifies success, while a weak and permeable state signifies failure. Thus, it is said that it involves both gain and loss. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou states: The firm presence of qi symbolizes success, while the weak and permeable nature symbolizes loss, discussed in terms of following, assisting, welcoming, and seizing. Previously mentioned concepts of weakness and strength indicate success and failure; the firm and the weak signify existence and non-existence. This illustrates that discussions of firm presence and weakness imply gain and loss. Ultimately, gain and loss, existence and non-existence carry the same meaning, providing a condensed scriptural explanation.]<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>The Eighty Difficulties state: The scriptures mention &quot;having a perception like entering&quot; and &quot;having a perception like exiting,&quot; what does this mean? Indeed. &quot;Having a perception like entering&quot; refers to the left hand feeling the qi arriving, then inserting the needle; when the needle enters, and the qi is felt to be exhausted, then the needle is withdrawn. This is called &quot;having a perception like entering&quot; and &quot;having a perception like exiting.&quot; </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The phrase &quot;having a perception like entering&quot; should be accompanied by &quot;having a perception like exiting.&quot; For example, read &quot;ruo&quot; (如) in a similar manner as &quot;yue&quot; (月). In Mengzi, it is written that one observes the Dao but does not yet see it, thus &quot;ruo&quot; can be used interchangeably. The concept of having perceptions of entering and exiting refers to the left hand pressing on the acupoint, waiting for the qi to arrive before inserting the needle. The needle is inserted, and when the qi response is felt to be exhausted, the needle is withdrawn.]</p>
<p>The Eighty-First Difficulties state: The scriptures mention &quot;no substance, substance, void, and emptiness, reducing what is insufficient while increasing what is excessive,&quot; does this refer to the cun (寸) pulse? Does a condition inherently have void and substance? How are reduction and increase related? Indeed. This condition does not refer solely to the cun pulse but indicates that the condition itself has void and substance. For instance, if the liver is full and the lungs are deficient, the liver corresponds to wood and the lungs to metal, which must balance each other; one should realize that metal must stabilize wood. Conversely, if the lungs are full and the liver is slightly deficient in qi, one should not tonify the liver but rather reduce excess in the lungs. Hence it is said, &quot;substance, substance; void, void; reduce what is insufficient while increasing what is excessive.&quot; This represents harm done by those of intermediate skill. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The two characters for &quot;this condition&quot; should be disregarded as errors or additions. If the liver is full and the lungs are deficient, metal should stabilize wood, as explained in the Seventy-Fifth Difficulty. If the lungs are full and the liver is deficient, then metal should be subdued while supporting wood.]<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>Those who use needles do not supplement the liver but rather excessively strengthen the lungs. This is what is meant by solidifying the solid while leaving the void empty, harming the insufficient while benefiting the excessive, which will certainly lead to death. The middle artisan, or a standard craftsman, is still referred to as a rough craftsman.</p>
<p>Note: The eighty-one chapters of the &quot;Nanjing&quot; are very concise, yet they encompass all aspects of meridian calculations, measurements, positions, yin and yang, royal relations, internal and external organs, pulse methods, illnesses, and the techniques of acupuncture points and areas, without omission. This chapter particularly emphasizes the profound practice of acupuncture, not only serving as a warning for needle practitioners but also as a caution for all healers. It captures the subtle meanings beautifully. Ah! The people of Yue, in the pre-Qin Warring States period, were not far from the origins of the &quot;Neijing&quot; and &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; There must have been some who could orally convey these teachings with clarity, hence the detailed expressions of their insights, not just as recorded by historians about Chang Sangjun&#39;s experiences. Shao Ji believes that what is truly difficult in the classics may not be limited to these eighty-one points. Alas, is there still hope for future generations?<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>Errors and Classifications</p>

<p>Seventeen difficulties: There are three questions asked but only one answer given, suggesting a possible oversight. </p>
<p>Eighteen difficulties: In the third section, Xie claims it should be the response from the sixteenth difficulty. The fourth section may be seen as connected to the seventeenth, or as an ongoing response without conclusion. </p>
<p>Twenty difficulties: The repletion of yang indicates mania, while the repletion of yin indicates disturbance; the depletion of yang pertains to visions, and the depletion of yin leads to blindness. This is likely a conclusion from the fifty-ninth difficulty, with an error in the transcription here. </p>
<p>Twenty-one difficulties: Xie states that according to the text&#39;s responses, the wording is not appropriate, suggesting a possible omission. </p>
<p>Twenty-three difficulties: The text states, &quot;clearly knowing the beginning and end,&quot; and Xie claims it should precede the following chapter; however, this is not necessarily required, just to be referenced. </p>
<p>Twenty-eight difficulties: The twelve characters stating &quot;overflow and stagnation cannot circulate to irrigate the twelve channels&quot; should not be constrained strictly to the twelve channels.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>If evil qi accumulates, it results in swelling and heat manifested through needle punctures, formed of twelve characters; Xie suggests this is a later addition.

<p>Regarding the twenty-ninth difficulty: Yang wei suffers from cold and heat, while Yin wei experiences heart pain; all are located in the lower back, like sitting in water.

<p>As for the thirty-first difficulty: Its organs are mentioned in the context of the qi street, where there might be a misprint or later addition in the text.

<p>　　　　上经<br>　　【滑寿曰：此书固有类例，但当如《大学》，朱子分章以见记者之意则可，不当以己之立类统经之篇章也。今观一难至二十一难皆言脉，二十二难至二十九难论经络流注始终、长短度数，奇经之行，及病之吉凶也。其间有云：脉者非谓尺寸之脉，乃经隧之脉也。三十难至四十三难言荣卫、三焦、脏腑、肠胃之详。四十四、五难言七冲门乃人身资生之用，八会为热病在内之气穴也。四十六、七难言老幼寤寐以明气血之盛衰，言人面耐寒以见阴阳之走会。<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>四十八难至六十一难，言诊候、病能、脏腑、积聚、泄利、伤寒、杂病之别，而继之望闻问切，医之能事毕矣。六十二难至八十一难言脏腑荣俞、用针补泻之法，又全体之学所不可无者。此记者以类相从始终之意备矣。】　　【滑寿曰：右寸手太阴阳明金，生左尺足太阳少阴水；太阳少阴水，生左关足厥阴少阳木；厥阴少阳木，生左寸手太阳少阴火；太阳少阴火，通右尺手心主少阳火；手心主少阳火，生右关足太阴阳明土；足太阴阳明土，复生右寸手太阴阳明金。此皆五行子母更相生养者也。】<br>　　经脉始从中焦流注之图<br>　　见图</p>

<p>　　【虞氏曰：经言男子生于寅，女子生于申，谓其父母之年会合于巳上，男左行十月，至寅而生；女右行十月，至申而生也。故推命家言，男一岁起丙寅，女一岁起壬申。《难经》不言起而言生，谓生下已为一岁矣。壬丙二干，水火也，水火为万物之父母；寅申二支，金木也，为生物成实之终始。木饱在申，金饱在寅，二气自饱相配，故用寅申也。金生于巳，巳与申合，故女子取申；木生于亥，亥与寅合，故男子取寅。所以男年十岁，顺行在亥；女年七岁，逆行在亥。男子十六天癸至，左行至巳，巳者申之生气；女年十四天癸至，右行亦在巳，与男子同在本宫生气之位。阴阳相配，成夫妇之道，故有男女也。上古天真论曰：男子二八而天癸至，精气溢泻，阴阳和，故能有子。女子二七天癸至，任脉通，太冲脉盛，故能有子。此之谓也。】<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>　　荣卫清浊升降之图<br>　　见图</p>

class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　一难曰：十二经皆有动脉，独取寸口，以决五脏六腑死生吉凶之法，何谓也？<br>　　【滑寿曰：十二经谓手足三阴三阳，合为十二经也。手经则太阴肺、阳明大肠、少阴心、太阳小肠、厥阴心包、少阳三焦也；足经则太阴脾、阳明胃、少阴肾、太阳膀胱、厥阴肝、少阳胆也。皆有动脉者，如手太阴脉动中府、云门、天府、侠白，手阳明脉动合谷、阳溪，手少阴脉动极泉，手太阳脉动天窻，手厥阴脉动劳宫，手少阳脉动禾髎，足太阴脉动箕门、冲门，足阳明脉动冲阳、大迎、人迎、气冲，足少阴脉动大溪、阴谷，足太阳脉动委中，足厥阴脉动太冲、五里、阴廉，足少阳脉动下关、听会之类也。谓之经者，以荣卫之流行经常不息者而言。谓之脉者，以血理之分袤行体者而言也。故经者径也，脉者陌也。越人之意，盖谓凡此十二经皆有动脉，如上云云，今置不取，乃独取寸口以决脏腑死生吉凶何耶？】<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　然。寸口者，脉之大会，手太阴之脉动也。　　【滑寿曰：此篇之大旨，下文详言之。寸口，气口也。居手太阴鱼际却行一寸之分，气口之下曰关曰尺云者，皆手太阴所历之处，而手太阴又为百脉流注朝会之始也。五脏别论，帝曰：气口何以独为五脏主？岐伯曰：胃者水谷之海，六腑之大源也。五味入口，藏于胃，以养五脏气而变见于气口也。《灵枢》第一篇云：脉会太渊。玉版论云：行奇恒之法，自太阴始。注谓先以气口太阴之脉，定四时之正气，然后度量奇恒之气也。经脉别论云：肺朝百脉；又云气口成寸，以决死生。合数论而观之，信知寸口当手太阴之部而为脉之大会明矣。此越人立问之意，所以独取夫寸口，而后世宗之为不易之法。着之篇首，乃开卷第一义也，学者详之。】<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　人一呼脉行三寸，一吸脉行三寸，呼吸定息，脉行六寸。人一日一夜，凡一万三千五百息，脉行五十度，周于身，漏水下百刻。荣卫行阳二十五度，行阴亦二十五度，为一周也。故五十度复会于手太阴寸口者，五脏六腑之所终始，故法取于寸口也。　　【滑寿曰：承上言平人不病而息数匀者也。呼者气之出，阳也；吸者气之入，阴也。《内经》平人气象论云：人一呼脉再动，一吸脉再动，呼吸定息，脉五动。闰以太息，命曰平人。故平人一呼脉行三寸，一吸脉行三寸，呼吸定息，脉行六寸。以呼吸之数言之，一日一夜，凡一万三千五百息；以脉行之数言之，则五十度周于身。而荣卫之行于阳者二十五度，行于阴者亦二十五度。出入阴阳，参考互注，无少间断，五十度毕，适当漏下百刻，为一晬时，又明日之平旦矣，乃复会于手太阴。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>此寸口所以为五脏六腑之所终始，而法有取于是焉。盖以荣卫始于中焦，注手太阴阳明，阳明注足阳明太阴，太阴注手少阴太阳，太阳注足太阳少阴，少阴注手心主少阳，少阳注足少阳厥阴。计呼吸二百七十息，脉行一十六丈二尺，漏下二刻为一周身。于是复还注手太阴，积而盈之。人一呼一吸为一息，每刻一百三十五息，每时八刻计一千八十息，十二时九十六刻计一万二千九百六十息，刻之余分得五百四十息，合一万三千五百息也。一息脉行六寸，每二刻二百七十息，脉行一十六丈二尺，每时八刻，脉行六十四丈八尺，荣卫四周于身。十二时计九十六刻，脉行七百七十七丈六尺，为四十八周身。刻之余分行二周身，得三十二丈四尺。总之为五十度周身，脉得八百一十丈也。此呼吸之息，脉行之数，周身之度，合昼夜百刻之详也。行阳行阴，谓行昼行夜也。】<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>　　二难曰：脉有尺寸，何谓也？然。尺寸者，脉之大要会也。　　【滑寿曰：《说文》云，尺，度名，十寸也。人手却十分动脉为寸口，十寸为尺，规矩事也。古者尺、寸、只、寻、常、仞诸度量，皆以人体为法，故从尸从一，象布指之状。寸，十分也。人手却一寸动脉谓寸口，从又从一，按如《说文》所纪，尤可见人体中脉之尺寸也。尺阴分，寸阳分也。人之一身经络荣卫、五脏六腑，莫不由于阴阳，而或过与不及，于尺寸见焉，故为脉之大要会也。一难言寸口为脉之大会，以肺朝百脉而言也。此言尺寸为脉之大要会，以阴阳对待而言也。大抵手太阴之脉，由中焦出行，一路直至两手大指之端。其鱼际却行一寸九分，通谓之寸口。于一寸九分之中，曰尺曰寸，而关在其中矣。】<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>　　从关至尺，是尺内，阴之所治也；从关至鱼际，是寸口内，阳之所治也。　　【滑寿曰：关者，掌后高骨之分，寸后尺前，两境间阴阳之界限也。从关至尺泽谓尺，尺之内，阴所治也。从关至鱼际是寸口，寸口之内，阳所治也。故孙思邈云：从肘腕中横文至掌鱼际后文却而十分之，而入取九分是为尺，　　〔 此九分者自肘腕入至鱼际为一尺，十分之为十寸，取第九分之一寸中为脉之尺位。〕　　从鱼际后文却还度取十分之一则是寸，　　〔 此寸字非寸关尺之寸，乃从肘腕横文至鱼际却而取十分中之一，是一寸也。以此一寸之中取九分为脉之寸口，故下文云：〕　　寸十分之，而入取九分之中，则寸口也。】<br>　　故分寸为尺，分尺为寸。<br>　　【滑寿曰：寸为阳，尺为阴，阳上而阴下。寸之下尺也，尺之上寸也，关居其中以为限也。分寸为尺，分尺为寸，此之谓欤？　　【自鱼际穴起一寸之后分为尺，自尺泽穴一尺之前分为寸也。】<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　故阴得尺内一寸，阳得寸内九分。<br>　　【滑寿曰：老阴之数终于十，故阴得尺内之一寸；〔此尺字指鱼际至尺泽，通计十寸者而言。〕 老阳之数极于九，故阳得寸内之九分。 〔 此寸字指人手却寸而言。〕 】<br>　　尺寸终始一寸九分，故曰尺寸也。<br>　　【滑寿曰：寸为尺之始，尺者寸之终。云尺寸者，以终始对待而言其实贮。寸得九分，尺得一寸，皆阴阳之盈数也。庞安常云：越人取手太阴之行度鱼际后一寸九分，以配阴阳之数。盖谓此也。】<br>　　三难曰：脉有太过有不及，有阴阳相乘，有复有溢，有关有格，何谓也？　　【滑寿曰：太过不及，病脉也；关格复溢，死脉也。关格之说，《素问》六节脏象论，及《灵枢》第九篇、第四十九篇，皆主气口人迎，以阳经取决于人迎，阴经取决于气口也。今越人乃以关前关后言者，以寸为阳而尺为阴也。】<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>　　然。关之前者，阳之动也，脉当见九分而浮。过者法曰太过，减者法曰不及。　　【滑寿曰：关前为阳寸脉所动之位，脉见九分而浮。九，阳数。寸之位，浮阳脉，是其常。过，谓过于本位，过于常脉。不及，谓不及本位，不及常脉，皆病脉也。】<br>　　遂上鱼为溢，为外关内格，此阴乘之脉也。　　【滑寿曰：遂者，隧也，径行而直前也。谢氏谓遂者直上直下，殊无回旋之生意，有旨哉！经曰：阴气太盛，则阳气不得相营也，以阳气不得营于阴，阴遂上出而溢于鱼际之分为外关内格也。外关内格，谓阳外闭而不下，阴从而内出以格拒之，此阴乘阳位之脉也。】<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　关以后者，阴之动也，脉当见一寸而沉。过者法曰太过，减者法曰不及。　　【滑寿曰：关后为阴尺脉所动之位，脉见一寸而沉。一寸，阴数。尺之位，沉阴脉，是其常。过，谓过于本位，过于常脉。不及，谓不及本位，不及常脉，皆病脉也。】<br>　　遂入尺为覆，为内关外格，此阳乘之脉也。　　【滑寿曰：经云阳气太盛，则阴气不得相营也。以阴气不得营于阳，阳遂下陷而复于尺之分，为内关外格也。内关外格，谓阴内闭而不上，阳从而外入以格拒之，此阳乘阴位之脉也。】<br>　　故曰：覆溢。<br>　　【滑寿曰：覆如物之覆，由上而倾于下也；溢如水之溢，由内而出乎外也。】<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>　　是其真脏之脉，人不病而死也。<br>　　【滑寿曰：覆溢之脉，乃孤阴独阳，上下相离之诊，故曰真脏之脉，谓无胃气以和之也。凡人得此脉，虽不病，犹死也。此篇言阴阳之太过不及，虽为病脉，犹未至危殆，若遂上鱼入尺而为覆溢，则死脉也。此遂字最为切紧，盖承上起下之要言。不然则太过不及，阴阳相乘，关格覆溢，浑为一意，漫无轻重矣。或间此篇之阴阳相乘，与二十篇之说同异。曰：此篇乃阴阳相乘之极，而为覆溢。二十篇则阴阳更相乘而伏匿也。更之一字，与此篇遂字，大有径庭。更者更互之更，遂者直遂之遂，而覆溢与伏匿，又不能无辨。盖覆溢为死脉，伏匿为病脉，故不可同日语也。此书首三篇，乃越人开卷第一义也。一难言寸口，统阴阳关尺而言。二难言尺寸，以阴阳始终对待而言，关亦在其中矣。三难之覆溢，以阴阳关格而言，尤见关为津要之所。合而观之，三部之义备矣。一二难言阴阳之常，三难言阴阳之变。】<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>　　四难曰：脉有阴阳之法何谓也？然。呼出心与肺，吸入肾与肝。呼吸之间，脾受谷味也，其脉在中。　　【滑寿曰：呼出为阳，吸入为阴，心肺为阳，肾肝为阴，各以部位之高下而应之也。一呼再动心肺主之，一吸再动，肾肝主之，呼吸定息脉五动，闰以太息，脾之候也。故曰呼吸之间，脾受谷味也，其脉在中。在中者，在阴阳呼吸之中。何则？以脾受谷味，灌溉诸脏，诸脏皆受气于脾土，主中宫之义也。】<br>　　浮者阳也，沉者阴也，故曰阴阳也。　　【滑寿曰：浮为阳，沉为阴，此承上文起下文之义。】<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>　　心肺俱浮，何以别之？然。浮而大散者心也，浮而短濇者肺也。肾肝俱沉，何以别之？然，牢而长者肝也；按之濡、举指来实者肾也。脾者中州，故其脉在中，是阴阳之法也。　　【滑寿曰：心肺俱浮而有别也，心为阳中之阳，故其脉浮而大散；肺为阳中之阴，其脉浮而短濇。肝肾俱沉而有别也，肝为阴中之阳，其脉牢而长；肾为阴中之阴，其脉按之濡，举指来实。古益袁氏谓肾属水脉，按之濡、举指来实，外柔内刚，水之象也。脾说见前。】<br>　　脉有一阴一阳、一阴二阳、一阴三阳，有一阳一阴、一阳二阴、一阳三阴，如此之言，寸口有六脉俱动邪？然，此言者，非有六脉俱动，谓浮、沉、长、短、滑、濇也。浮者阳也，滑者阳也，长者阳也；沉者阴也，短者阴也，濇者阴也。所谓一阴一阳者，谓脉来沉而滑也；一阴二阳者，谓脉来沉滑而长也；一阴三阳者，谓脉来浮滑而长，时一沉也。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>所言一阳一阴者，谓脉来浮而濇也；一阳二阴者，谓脉来长而沉濇也；一阳三阴者，谓脉来沉濇而短，时一浮也。各以其经所在，名病逆顺也。　　【滑寿曰：设问答以明阴阳脉见于三部者，不单至也。惟其不单至，故有此六脉相兼，而见浮者轻手得之，长者过度本位，滑者往来流利，皆阳脉也；沉者重手得之，短者不及本位，濇者往来凝滞，皆阴脉也。惟其相兼，故有一阴一阳，又一阳一阴，如是之不一也。夫脉之所至，病之所在也，以脉与病及经络脏腑参之，某为宜，某为不宜，四时相应不相应，以名病之逆顺也。】<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>　　五难曰：脉有轻重，何谓也？然。初持脉如三菽之重，与皮毛相得者，肺部也；如六菽之重，与血脉相得者，心部也；如九菽之重，与肌肉相得者，脾部也；如十二菽之重，与筋平者，肝部也；按之至骨，举指来疾者，肾部也。故曰轻重也。　　【滑寿曰：肺最居上，主候皮毛，故其脉如三菽之重。心在肺下，主血脉，故其脉如六菽之重。脾在心下，主肌肉，故其脉如九菽之重。肝在脾下，主筋，故其脉如十二菽之重。肾在肝下主骨，故其脉按之至骨举指来实。<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>肾不言菽，以类推之，当如十五菽之重。今按此法以轻重言之，即浮中沉之意也，然于《枢》、《素》无所见，将古脉法而有所授受耶？抑越人自得之见耶？】　　【庐陵谢氏曰：此寸关尺所主脏腑各有分位，而一部之中脉又自有轻重。因举陵阳虞氏说云：假令左手寸口如三菽之重得之，乃知肺气之至；如六菽之重得之，知本经之至，余以类求之。夫如是乃知五脏之气更相灌溉，六脉因兹亦有准绳，可以定吉凶言疾病矣。关尺皆然，如十难中十变脉例而消息之也。】<br>　　六难曰：脉有阴盛阳虚，阳盛阴虚，何谓也？然。浮之损小，沉之实大，故曰阴盛阳虚；沉之损小，浮之实大，故曰阳盛阴虚。是阴阳虚实之意也。　　【滑寿曰：浮沉以下指轻重言，盛虚以阴阳盈亏言，轻手取之而见减少，重手取之而见实大，知其为阴盛阳虚也；重手取之而见损小，轻手取之而见实大，知其为阳盛阴虚也。大抵轻手取之阳之分，重手取之阴之分，不拘何部，率以是推之。】<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>　　七难曰：经言少阳之至，乍大乍小，乍短乍长；阳明之至，浮大而短；太阳之至，洪大而长；太阴之至，紧大而长；少阴之至，紧细而微；厥阴之至，沉短而敦。此六者是平脉邪？将病脉邪？然。皆王脉也。　　【滑寿曰：六者之王，说见下文。】<br>　　其气以何月，各王几日？然。冬至之后，得甲子少阳王，复得甲子阳明王，复得甲子太阳王，复得甲子太阴王，复得甲子少阴王，复得甲子厥阴王。王各六十日，六六三百六十日，以成一岁，此三阳三阴之王时日大要也。　　【滑寿曰：上文言三阳三阴之王脉，此言三阳三阴之王时，当其时则见其脉也。历家之说，以上古十一月甲子合朔，冬至为历元，盖取夫气朔之分齐也。<a id="orig-20p" href="#trans-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>然天度之运，与日月之行，迟速不一，岁各有差，越人所谓冬至之后得甲子，亦以此欤？是故气朔之不齐，节候之早晚，不能常也。故丁氏注谓冬至之后得甲子，或在小寒之初，或在大寒之后，少阳之至始于此，余经各以次继之。纪氏亦谓自冬至之日一阳始生，于冬至之后得甲子，少阳脉王也。若原其本始，以十一月甲子合朔冬至常例推之，则少阳之王便当从此日始，至正月中，余经各以次继之。少阳之至，阳气尚微，故其脉乍大乍小，乍短乍长。阳明之至，犹有阴也，故其脉浮大而短。太阳之至，阳盛而极也，故其脉洪大而长。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>阳盛极则变而之阴矣，故夏至后为三阴用事之始。而太阴之至。阴气上微，故其脉紧大而长。少阴之至，阴渐盛也，故其脉紧细而微，厥阴之至，阴盛而极也，故其脉沉短以敦。阴盛极则变而之阳，仍三阳用事之始也。此则三阳三阴之王脉，所以经六甲而循四时，率皆从微以至乎着，自渐而趋于极，各有其序也。】　　【袁氏曰：春温而夏暑，秋凉而冬寒，故人六经之脉，亦随四时阴阳消长迭运而至也。<a id="orig-22p" href="#trans-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>】　　【刘温舒曰：至真要论云，厥阴之至其脉弦，少阴之至其脉钩，太阴之至其脉沉，少阳之至大而浮，阳明之至短而濇，太阳之至大而长，亦随天地之气卷舒也。如春弦、夏洪、秋毛、冬石之类，则五运六气，四时亦皆应之，而见于脉尔。若平人气象论太阳脉至洪大而长，少阳脉至乍数乍疏，乍短乍长，阳明脉至浮大而短，《难经》引之以论三阴三阳之脉者，以阴阳始生之浅深而言之也。】　　【篇首称经言二字，考之《枢》、《素》无所见。平人气象论虽略有其说而不详，岂越人之时别有所谓上古文字耶？将《内经》有之，而后世脱简耶？是不可知也。后凡言经言而无所考者，义皆仿此。】<a id="orig-23p" href="#trans-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>　　八难曰：寸口脉平而死者，何谓也？然。诸十二经脉者，皆系于生气之原。所谓生气之原者，谓十二经之根本也，谓肾间动气也。此五脏六腑之本，十二经脉之根，吸呼之门，三焦之原，一名守邪之神。故气者人之根本也，根绝则茎叶枯矣。寸口脉平而死者，生气独绝于内也。　　【滑寿曰：肾间动气，人所得于天以生之气也。肾为子水，位乎坎，北方卦也。乃天一之数而火木金土之先也，所以为生气之原，诸经之根本，又为守邪之神也。原气胜，则邪不能侵。原气绝，则死如木，根绝而茎叶枯矣。故寸口脉平而死者，以生气独绝于内也。】　　【此篇与第一难之说，义若相悖，然各有所指也。一难以寸口决生死者，谓寸口为脉之大会，而谷气之变见也。此篇以原气言也，人之原气盛则生，原气绝，则寸口脉虽平犹死也。原气言其体，谷气言其用也。】<a id="orig-24p" href="#trans-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>　　九难曰：何以别知脏腑之病耶？然。数者腑也，迟者脏也。数则为热，迟则为寒。诸阳为热，诸阴为寒。故以别知脏腑之病也。　　【滑寿曰：凡人之脉，一呼一吸为一息，一息之间脉四至，闰以太息，脉五至，命曰平人。平人者，不病之脉也，其有增减，则为病焉。故一息三至曰迟，不足之脉也；一息六至曰数，太过之脉也。脏为阴，腑为阳。脉数者，属腑，为阳、为热；脉迟者，属脏，为阴、为寒。不特是也，诸阳脉皆为热，诸阴脉皆为寒。脏腑之病，由是别之。】<a id="orig-25p" href="#trans-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>　　十难曰：一脉为十变者，何谓也？然。五邪刚柔，相逢之意也。假令心脉急甚者，肝邪干心也；心脉微急者，胆邪干小肠也。心脉大甚者，心邪自干心也；心脉微大者，小肠邪自干小肠也。心脉缓甚者，脾邪干心也；心脉微缓者，胃邪干小肠也。心脉濇甚者，肺邪干心也；心脉微濇者，大肠邪干小肠也。心脉沉甚者，肾邪干心也；心脉微沉者，膀胱邪干小肠也。五脏各有刚柔邪，故令一脉辄变为十也。　　【滑寿曰：五邪者，谓五脏五腑之气，失其正而为邪者也。刚柔者，阳为刚，阴为柔也。刚柔相逢，谓脏逢脏，腑逢腑也。五脏五腑，各有五邪，以脉之来甚者属脏，微者属腑，特以心脏发其例，余可类推，故云一脉辄变为十也。】<a id="orig-26p" href="#trans-26p"

Among them, it is stated: a pulse does not merely refer to the size of the pulse but rather the pulse of the meridians. From the thirtieth difficulty to the forty-third, the discussion focuses on the nourishing and protecting aspects, the triple burner, the organs, and the details of the intestines and stomach. The forty-fourth and forty-fifth difficulties discuss the seven pathways that serve the nourishment of the body, while the eight gatherings concern the vital points of heat diseases within. The forty-sixth and forty-seventh difficulties discuss the waking and sleeping of young and old as a reflection of the abundance or deficiency of qi and blood, and mention how a person&#39;s face can endure cold to indicate the movement of yin and yang.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Yu said: The classics state that a boy is born in the year of Yin (Tiger), and a girl in the year of Shen (Monkey), meaning their parents&#39; ages converge in the year of Si (Snake). A boy&#39;s journey goes left for ten months, culminating in Yin and birth; a girl&#39;s journey goes right for ten months, culminating in Shen and birth. Thus, according to destiny scholars, a boy begins at the first year with Bing Yin, and a girl begins at the first year with Ren Shen. The &#39;Nan Jing&#39; does not mention the beginning, but rather states that being born equates to already being one year old. Ren and Bing are the two heavenly stems representing Water and Fire, the parents of all things; Yin and Shen are the two earthly branches representing Metal and Wood, marking the beginning and end of the natural order. Wood is abundant in Shen, and Metal is abundant in Yin; these two energies correspond well, thus both Yin and Shen are utilized. Metal emerges in Si, which is paired with Shen, hence girls involve Shen; Wood emerges in Hai, which is paired with Yin, hence boys involve Yin. Therefore, when a boy is ten years old, he follows the path through Hai; when a girl is seven years old, she also moves towards Hai in the reverse direction. A boy at sixteen experiences Tian Gui in Si, progressing left to engage the vital energy of Si; a girl at fourteen experiences Tian Gui also in Si, aligned in the same palace of vital energy as the boy. The matching of Yin and Yang thus establishes the path of husband and wife, which is why there are male and female. The ancient text on natural simplicity states: When a boy reaches the age of sixteen and experiences Tian Gui, his essence overflows, and Yin and Yang harmonize, thus he can have offspring. When a girl reaches the age of fourteen and experiences Tian Gui, her Ren Meridian opens, and the Tai Chong Meridian thrives, thus she can have offspring. This is what it refers to.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One question asks: Why is it that among the twelve channels, which all have arteries, only the pulse at the wrist is used to determine the life and death, fortune and misfortune of the five organs and six bowels?</p>
<p>[Hua Shou replies: The twelve channels refer to the three yin and three yang of the hands and feet, totaling twelve. The channels of the hands are: Taiyin of the Lung, Yangming of the Large Intestine, Shaoyin of the Heart, Taiyang of the Small Intestine, Jueyin of the Pericardium, and Shaoyang of the Triple Burner. The channels of the feet are: Taiyin of the Spleen, Yangming of the Stomach, Shaoyin of the Kidney, Taiyang of the Bladder, Jueyin of the Liver, and Shaoyang of the Gallbladder. All have arteries branching out, such as the hand Taiyin pulse at Zhongfu, Yunmen, Tianfu, and Xiabai; the hand Yangming pulse at Hegu and Yangxi; the hand Shaoyin pulse at Jizhong; the hand Taiyang pulse at Tiankuang; the hand Jueyin pulse at Laogong; the hand Shaoyang pulse at Helyao; the foot Taiyin pulse at Jimen and Chongmen; the foot Yangming pulse at Chongyang, Daying, Renying, and Qichong; the foot Shaoyin pulse at Daxie and Yingu; the foot Taiyang pulse at Weizhong; the foot Jueyin pulse at Taichong, Wuli, and Yinlian; the foot Shaoyang pulse at Xiaguan and Tinghui, among others. The term “channel” indicates that the flow of nourishment and defense circulates constantly. The term “pulse” refers to the segmented distribution of blood throughout the body. Therefore, channels are direct pathways, while pulses are side paths. The meaning implies that all twelve channels have arteries as mentioned above, so why is only the pulse at the wrist chosen to determine the life and death of the organs?]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Indeed, the inch pulse is the great meeting point of the pulse, and it reflects the motion of the Hand Taiyin channel. </p>
<p>[Huashou explains: The main purpose of this passage will be elaborated in the following text. The inch pulse is the pulse of qi. Residing at the fish border of the Hand Taiyin, it is measured by a division of one inch. Below the qi pulse are the points called Guan and Chi, which are all places traversed by the Hand Taiyin, and the Hand Taiyin is the origin of the flow of the hundred pulses as they converge. As for the five viscera, there is a separate discussion; the sovereign asks: why does the qi pulse exclusively govern the five viscera? Qibo replies: the stomach is the sea of water and grain, and the major source of the six intestines. The five flavors enter through the mouth, are stored in the stomach, nourish the qi of the five viscera, and manifest at the qi pulse. The first chapter of the &quot;Lingshu&quot; states: the pulse converges at Taiyuan. The Jade Tablet discourse states: the method of regulating the extraordinary and the consistent begins with Taiyin. It is emphasized that first, with the qi pulse of the Hand Taiyin, the standard qi of the four seasons should be established, and then the extraordinary and consistent qi measured. The separate discussion of the meridians says: the lung governs the hundred pulses; it also states that the qi pulse forms the inch, which decides life and death. Observing in conjunction with numerical theories, it is evident that the inch pulse corresponds to the Hand Taiyin and thus represents the great meeting point of the pulses. This reflects the inquiry of the Yue people, which is why the inch pulse is uniquely emphasized, establishing it as a reliable method for future generations. Placing it at the beginning of this text opens the first principle; scholars should study it in detail.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a person exhales, the pulse travels three inches; when they inhale, the pulse travels three inches. With the breathing settled, the pulse travels six inches. Over a period of one day and night, there are a total of 13,500 breaths, and the pulse travels fifty degrees, circulating around the body, leaking a hundred moments. The flow of nourishment and defense moves twenty-five degrees in yang and twenty-five degrees in yin, completing one cycle. Therefore, the fifty degrees converge at the inch pulse of the hand Taiyin, which is where the internal organs begin and end, thus the method is taken from the inch pulse.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: Referring to the above, this concerns a healthy person without illness who has regular breath counts. Exhalation relates to the output of qi, which is yang; inhalation relates to the intake of qi, which is yin. According to the Huainanjing&#39;s theory on healthy qi: with each exhalation, the pulse moves again, and with each inhalation, the pulse moves again, and when breathing settles, the pulse moves five times. Adding the great breath, this is termed a healthy person. Thus, when a healthy person exhales, the pulse moves three inches; when they inhale, the pulse moves three inches, and with settled breathing, the pulse moves six inches. Considering the number of breaths, there are a total of 13,500 breaths in one day and night; considering the movement of the pulse, it travels fifty degrees around the body. The flow of nourishment and defense in yang is twenty-five degrees, and in yin, also twenty-five degrees. The interaction between yin and yang is reciprocal and uninterrupted, completing fifty degrees, akin to the leaking of a hundred moments, marking one unit of time, and at dawn the next day, it again converges at the hand Taiyin.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This inch pulse is the beginning and end of the five organs and six bowels, and the law of observation derives from this. It is understood that nourishment and protection begin in the middle burner, with the hand Taiyin channel noted, followed by the Yangming channel which connects to the foot Yangming and Taiyin, continuing to the hand Shaoyin and Taiyang, with the Taiyang flowing to the foot Taiyang and Shaoyin, and the Shaoyin moving to the hand Xin (Heart) and Shaoyang, culminating at the foot Shaoyang and Jueyin. </p>
<p>Counting the breaths as two hundred seventy per cycle, the pulse travels sixteen zhang and two chi, while two moments constitute one full body cycle. This process returns to the hand Taiyin, accumulating and filling it. A person’s inhalation and exhalation count as one breath; there are one hundred thirty-five breaths per moment, eight moments per hour yielding one thousand eighty breaths, and twelve hours plus ninety-six moments totals twelve thousand nine hundred sixty breaths. Dividing the excess results in five hundred forty breaths, combining to form thirteen thousand five hundred breaths.</p>
<p>One breath corresponds to a six-inch pulse movement, with two moments equating to two hundred seventy breaths, which again covers the journey of sixteen zhang and two chi per hour. This means that during eight moments, the pulse moves sixty-four zhang and eight chi, nourishing and protecting the body all around. </p>
<p>In twelve hours, accounting for ninety-six moments, the pulse travels seven hundred seventy-seven zhang and six chi, resulting in forty-eight full body cycles. Dividing the excess results in two extra body cycles, totaling thirty-two zhang and four chi. Overall, this is fifty full body measurements with the pulse reaching eight hundred ten zhang. </p>
<p>This encompasses the breaths, pulse counts, and body measurements, providing a detailed account of the hundred moments of day and night, distinguishing between the movement of Yang and Yin, representing the movement of day and night.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Second Difficulty states: The pulse has dimensions, what does this mean? Indeed, the dimensions refer to the major significance of the pulse. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: &quot;According to the &#39;Shuo Wen,&#39; the &#39;chi&#39; (尺) is a unit of measure equal to ten &#39;cun&#39; (寸). In the human hand, the pulse is measured at a ten-fold radius as &#39;cun,&#39; where ten cun make up one chi; this is a regulation measurement. In ancient times, units like chi, cun, zhi, xun, chang, and ren were all based on the human body, thus the characters combine the body and a single unit, representing the shape of fingers. &#39;Cun&#39; means ten parts. In the human hand, the pulse at one cun is referred to as &#39;cun kou,&#39; and as noted in the &#39;Shuo Wen,&#39; it illustrates the dimensions of the pulse within the human body. </p>
<p>The chi represents the yin division while the cun represents the yang division. Every meridian, organ, and bodily system operates by yin and yang, whether excessive or deficient, reflected in their measurements, thus underscoring the major significance of the pulse. One might say that &#39;cun kou&#39; is of great importance to the pulse, as it pertains to the lungs in relation to all pulses. This refers to dimensions as being of substantial significance concerning the interaction of yin and yang. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, the meridian of the Taiyin travels from the middle jiao and extends all the way to the tip of both thumbs. The area near the fish joints stretches a length of one cun and nine fen, commonly referred to as &#39;cun kou.&#39; Within this one cun and nine fen, terms like chi and cun are significant and are contained within those measurements.]<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Hua Shou said: The &quot;Guan&quot; is the boundary between the high bone at the back of the palm and the two regions of Yin and Yang, between the &quot;Cun&quot; and &quot;Chi.&quot; From the &quot;Guan&quot; to the &quot;Chi Ze&quot; is called the &quot;Chi,&quot; and within the Chi, it is governed by Yin. From the &quot;Guan&quot; to the &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; which is the &quot;Cun Kou,&quot; within the &quot;Cun Kou,&quot; it is governed by Yang. Therefore, Sun Simiao said: From the horizontal line between the elbow and wrist to the back of the palm at the &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; it is measured as ten parts, and one takes nine parts to define the &quot;Chi.&quot; </p>
<p>[This nine parts refers to the distance from the elbow and wrist to the &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; representing one &quot;Chi.&quot; Ten parts represent ten &quot;Cun,&quot; and taking one-ninth of an inch in this context denotes the position of the pulse related to the &quot;Chi.&quot; From &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; measuring back and taking one-tenth yields the &quot;Cun,&quot; </p>
<p>[This character &quot;Cun&quot; is not the same as the &quot;Cun&quot; associated with &quot;Guan&quot; and &quot;Chi,&quot; rather it is measured from the horizontal line between the elbow and wrist to the &quot;Yu Ji,&quot; taking one-tenth, representing one &quot;Cun.&quot; Thus, from this one &quot;Cun,&quot; taking nine parts defines the pulse &quot;Cun Kou.&quot; Hence it is said: &quot;Cun is one-tenth, taking nine parts within is the &#39;Cun Kou.&quot;]</p>
<p>Thus, dividing the &quot;Cun&quot; into &quot;Chi&quot; and dividing the &quot;Chi&quot; into &quot;Cun.&quot; </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: &quot;Cun&quot; is Yang, &quot;Chi&quot; is Yin, with Yang above and Yin below. The &quot;Cun&quot; is below the &quot;Chi,&quot; while the &quot;Chi&quot; is above the &quot;Cun,&quot; and the &quot;Guan&quot; serves as the boundary. Dividing &quot;Cun&quot; into &quot;Chi&quot; and &quot;Chi&quot; into &quot;Cun,&quot; is this correct? </p>
<p>[From the &quot;Yu Ji&quot; point, one inch further divides into &quot;Chi,&quot; and from the &quot;Chi Ze&quot; point, one foot before it divides into &quot;Cun.&quot;]<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This is the true pulse of the organ; one may die without being ill. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The pulse of overflow signifies solitary yin and solitary yang, with the upper and lower regions being separate. Thus, it is called the true pulse of the organ, referring to the absence of stomach qi for balance. If a person possesses this pulse, even without illness, they are still doomed to die. This text discusses the extremes of yin and yang; although it denotes a diseased pulse, it does not yet signal imminent danger. If one were to proceed with excessive input and engage in overflow, then it becomes a dead pulse. The character &#39;sui&#39; (to proceed) is particularly crucial, as it connects the preceding and following essential points. Otherwise, the extremes of yin and yang, the interaction and overflow, become a single concept, with no distinctions or priorities. </p>
<p>Some might question the differences in the discussion of yin and yang between this text and the twenty chapters. It is said that this chapter represents the ultimate manifestation of yin and yang interacting as overflow, whereas the twenty chapters depict the further interaction of yin and yang in a concealed manner. The character &#39;geng&#39; (to change) is distinctly different from &#39;sui&#39;; &#39;geng&#39; indicates mutual interaction, while &#39;sui&#39; suggests direct progression. Moreover, overflow and concealment cannot be conflated, as overflow signifies a dead pulse, while concealment indicates a diseased pulse, hence they should not be discussed together. </p>
<p>The first three chapters of this book represent the fundamental teachings of the Yue people. The first difficulty is articulating the pulse at the wrist, encompassing both yin and yang as they relate to the measurement. The second difficulty is discussing sizes, with yin and yang presented in relation to each other throughout the measurement. The third difficulty pertains to overflow, using yin and yang as the framework for understanding, emphasized particularly in the context of measurement as a crucial focal point. Observed as a whole, the meanings of these three components are complete. The first two difficulties address the constancy of yin and yang, while the third addresses the variability of yin and yang.]<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

With each exhale, the heart and lungs take charge, and with each inhale, the kidneys and liver govern.

Thus, it is said, &quot;Between the breaths, the spleen receives the flavor of grains, which is within the pulse.&quot; This &quot;within&quot; refers to being in the midst of yin and yang breathing.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When both the heart and lungs are floating, how can they be distinguished? Indeed, the floating and widely spread pulse indicates the heart, while the floating and short pulse indicates the lungs. When both the kidneys and liver are sinking, how can they be distinguished? Yes, the firm and long pulse indicates the liver; the moist pulse, which feels solid when lifted, indicates the kidneys. The spleen is the center of the body, therefore its pulse is found in the middle, reflecting the principle of yin and yang.</p>
<p>Hua Shou said: the heart and lungs are floating yet distinct; the heart is the supreme yang, hence its pulse is floating and widely spread; the lungs are the yin within yang, thus its pulse is floating and short. The kidneys and liver are sinking yet distinct; the liver is the yang within yin, so its pulse is firm and long; the kidneys are the yin within yin, leading to a moist pulse that feels solid when lifted. The ancient scholar Yuan noted that the kidneys belong to the water pulse, showing exterior softness yet inner firmness, embodying the essence of water. The explanation of the spleen is as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Pulses may have one yin and one yang, one yin and two yang, or one yin and three yang; conversely, there may be one yang and one yin, one yang and two yin, or one yang and three yin. Is it possible that at the cun position all six pulses are present? Indeed, this does not mean all six pulses are active, but refers to the characteristics of floating, sinking, long, short, slippery, and wiry. Floating signifies yang, slippery also signifies yang, and long signifies yang; while sinking signifies yin, short signifies yin, and wiry signifies yin. The term one yin and one yang describes a pulse that is sinking yet slippery; one yin and two yang refers to a pulse that is sinking, slippery, and long; one yin and three yang describes a pulse that is floating, slippery, and long, sometimes sinking.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>Hua Shou said: The inquiry and answers clarify that the yin and yang pulses observed in the three regions are not simply singular. Because they are not singular, there are these six pulses coexisting: a floating pulse is felt lightly, a long pulse is excessive in its original position, and a slippery pulse flows smoothly—all of which are yang pulses; a deep pulse is felt heavily, a short pulse fails to reach its original position, and a thin pulse stagnates in its flow—all of which are yin pulses. Because they coexist, there are instances of one yin and one yang, as well as one yang and one yin, illustrating their variability. Thus, where the pulse travels indicates the location of the illness; correlating the pulse with the illness and the organs, some are appropriate while others are not, resonating or not corresponding with the four seasons, which indicates the contrary or in accordance nature of the illness.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The kidneys do not verbally express their principles, but one could deduce their nature by analogy, as it would be like the weight of fifteen beans. Now, when we apply this method to express weight, it would correspond to the notion of floating and sinking. However, there is no mention of this in the “Pivot” or “Essence” texts. Is it passed down from the ancient pulse methods or is it an insight gained by the Yue people themselves?</p>
<p>The Xie family of Luling states: In the measurements of the cun (寸) and ge (尺) pulse positions, each organ has its specific loci, and within each section, the pulse itself also has variation in weight. For instance, as the Yushi of Lingyang pointed out: If the left wrist&#39;s cun feels like the weight of three beans, that indicates the influx of lung qi; if it feels like six beans, it indicates the flow of the fundamental meridian, and one should similarly infer for the rest. Thus, one understands that the energies of the five organs interpenetrate each other, and the six pulses consequently provide a standard, which can determine auspiciousness or illness. The same applies to other pulse positions, like the examples of the ten difficulties and their variations.</p>
<p>The sixth difficulty states: The pulse may present with an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang or an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. What does this mean? Indeed, when the floating pulse is diminished, it indicates lightness; when the sinking pulse is solid, it indicates heaviness, thus illustrating an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; conversely, when the sinking pulse is diminished and the floating pulse is solid, this indicates an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. This is the essence of the concepts of yin, yang, deficiency, and fullness. </p>
<p>Hua Shou remarks: The terms floating and sinking refer to weight, while excess and deficiency are described in terms of yin and yang balancing. A light touch reveals less, while a heavy touch shows more, indicating an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; conversely, a heavy touch reveals less, while a light touch shows more, indicating an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. Generally, a light touch reveals the yang aspect, while a heavy touch reveals the yin aspect, regardless of the specific location; this principle serves as the basis for further deductions.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The movement of celestial cycles, along with the paths of the sun and moon, varies in speed; years differ among themselves, as spoken of by the people of Yue regarding the first cycle after the winter solstice. Thus, the irregularity of seasonal changes and the timing of natural phenomena cannot remain constant. Therefore, Ding&#39;s commentary states that the first cycle after the winter solstice can occur either at the beginning of minor cold or after major cold; the arrival of lesser yang begins here, followed by the other phases in order. Ji&#39;s commentary also states that from the day of the winter solstice, the first yang is born. Thus, the first cycle after the winter solstice represents the true king of lesser yang. If we trace its origin, based on the common practices of combining the first cycle with the winter solstice, then the king of lesser yang should indeed begin from this day, continuing through the middle of the first month, followed by the other phases in succession. When lesser yang arrives, the yang energy is still weak, which is why its pulse fluctuates in size—it varies between being large and small, and between being short and long. When greater yang arrives, there remains some yin, which is why its pulse is superficial, large, and short. When the supreme yang arrives, the yang is abundant and at its peak, hence its pulse becomes vigorous, large, and long.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

These also correspond to the movements of the qi of heaven and earth. For example, in spring, the pulse is string-like; in summer, it is torrential; in autumn, it is fine; and in winter, it is solid.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Eight Difficulties state: If the pulse at the cun position is flat and one dies, what does this mean? Indeed, all twelve meridians are connected to the source of vital energy. The so-called source of vital energy refers to the roots of the twelve meridians, which lie in the movement of energy within the kidneys. This is the foundation of the five organs and six bowels, the root of the twelve meridians, the gate of inhalation and exhalation, and the origin of the triple burner, also known as the spirit that guards against pathogens. Therefore, vital energy is the essence of life; if it is cut off, the branches and leaves wither. If the pulse at the cun position is flat and one dies, it indicates that vital energy has been completely severed internally.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The movement of energy within the kidneys is the vital energy that people receive from heaven for life. The kidneys are the water of the child, positioned within Kan, representing the northern hexagram. They are the numerical singularity of heaven and precede fire, wood, metal, and earth, hence serving as the source of vital energy, the root of all meridians, and the spirit that guards against pathogens. When the original vital energy is strong, pathogens cannot invade. When the original vital energy is lost, one dies like a tree, with its roots severed and branches and leaves withered. Thus, if the pulse at the cun position is flat and one dies, it signifies that the vital energy has been exclusively severed internally.]</p>

The first difficulty states that death can be determined by the cun pulse, meaning the cun is a major point for assessing life and death, where changes in the qi can be observed. This passage discusses original qi; when a person&#39;s original qi is abundant, they live, and when original qi is depleted, even if the cun pulse is flat, one still dies. Original qi refers to its essence, while food qi refers to its function.]<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Nine Difficulties state: How can we distinguish the diseases of the viscera and bowels? Indeed, the rapid pulse indicates the bowels, while the slow pulse indicates the viscera. A rapid pulse suggests heat, whereas a slow pulse suggests cold. All yang-related conditions indicate heat, and all yin-related conditions indicate cold. Thus, we can differentiate the diseases of the viscera and bowels.</p>
<p>【Hua Shou said: In general, for a person&#39;s pulse, one inhalation and one exhalation constitute one breath. Within one breath, the pulse beats four times; if extended, it beats five times, and this is called the pulse of a healthy person. A healthy person has a stable pulse; any increase or decrease indicates illness. Therefore, if there are three beats in one breath, it is called slow, indicative of an insufficient pulse; if there are six beats, it is called rapid, indicative of an excessive pulse. The viscera are yin, and the bowels are yang. A rapid pulse is associated with the bowels, indicating yang and heat; a slow pulse is associated with the viscera, indicating yin and cold. This principle applies not just to these cases, as all yang pulses signify heat and all yin pulses signify cold. The diseases of the viscera and bowels are differentiated based on these principles.】<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Ten Difficulties&quot; states: What does it mean that a single pulse manifests as ten variations? It is so. The five evils represent the interplay of hardness and softness. For example, if the heart pulse is very rapid, it suggests that liver evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly rapid, it indicates that gallbladder evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is very strong, it means heart evil is affecting the heart itself; if the heart pulse is slightly strong, it implies that small intestine evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is extremely slow, it suggests spleen evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly slow, it indicates that stomach evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is very thin, it suggests lung evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly thin, it means large intestine evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is very deep, it indicates kidney evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly deep, it suggests bladder evil is affecting the small intestine. Each of the five organs has its corresponding hardness and softness evils, thus a single pulse can seemingly transform into ten variations.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The five evils refer to the qi of the five organs and five bowels that have deviated from their proper state and become evil. Hardness and softness denote yang as hardness and yin as softness. The interplay of hardness and softness means that organs intersect with organs, and bowels intersect with bowels. Each of the five organs and five bowels has five evils; thus, for those pulses that are very strong, they belong to the organs, while those that are weak belong to the bowels. This is particularly exemplified with the heart, and the others can be inferred by analogy, hence it is said that a single pulse can transform into ten variations.]<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

When a person inhales, it enters with Yin, and when they exhale, it arises with Yang. Now, if the inhalation cannot reach the kidneys and only reaches the liver before returning, it is known that the organ lacking energy is the kidneys, as their energy is depleted first.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: In the fifth chapter of &quot;The Spirit Pivot,&quot; it is mentioned that a person takes in energy fifty times a day and night to nourish the essence of the five organs. If this number is not achieved, it is called a mad living. The so-called fifty times means that each of the five organs receives energy, and one counts their pulse at each intake. If there are fifty beats without a replacement, it means all five organs receive energy; if there are forty beats with one replacement, one organ lacks energy; if there are thirty beats with one replacement, two organs lack energy; if there are twenty beats with one replacement, three organs lack energy; if there are ten beats with one replacement, four organs lack energy; and if there are fewer than ten beats with one replacement, all five organs lack energy, leading to a short lifespan. The kidneys are located at the lowest point among the five organs, and inhalation is the furthest; thus, if there are fifty beats but one stops, it indicates that the kidneys lack support, and their energy should be depleted first.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Twelve Difficulties states: The classics say that when the pulses of the five organs are severed internally, the practitioner needles externally; when the pulses of the five organs are severed externally, the practitioner needles internally. How can one distinguish between the severing of inside and outside? Indeed, when the pulses of the five organs are severed internally, the qi of the kidneys and liver has also been severed within, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the heart and lungs; when the pulses of the five organs are severed externally, the pulses of the heart and lungs have also been severed outside, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the kidneys and liver. Supplementing yang for the deficiency of yin and supplementing yin for the deficiency of yang is what is called truly supporting and truly depleting, diminishing the insufficient and augmenting the abundant. In such cases, the dead person is killed by the physician.</p>
<p>Hua Shou states: In the first chapter of the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; it is said that before using needles, one must first diagnose the pulses and observe the severity of the condition to treat it appropriately. In the third chapter, it states that when the qi of the five organs is severed internally, the pulse&#39;s qi cannot reach inward, yet one takes the external area of disease, connecting to the yang vessels, leaving needles to draw forth yang qi; when the yang qi arrives, the internal heavy supply is depleted, and when depleted, death occurs, for there is no qi to move, hence it lies still. When the qi of the five organs is severed externally, the pulse&#39;s qi cannot reach outward, yet one takes the channels of the four extremities, leaving needles to draw forth yin qi; when the yin qi arrives, the yang qi reverses and enters, and upon entering, this reversal leads to death, for the excess of yin qi results in agitation. This distinction of pulses, internal and external, speaks to yin and yang. The people of Yue differentiate inside and outside of heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver to explain yin and yang by this principle. The Ji family suggests that this chapter discusses needling techniques, while Feng Jie states that this chapter corresponds to methods of supplementing and depleting with needles; it should be placed after the sixty difficulties as examples follow one another.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Hua Shou says: In the fourth chapter of &quot;Lingshu,&quot; it states that to see the color and understand the illness is called &#39;ming&#39;; to feel the pulse and know the illness is called &#39;shen&#39;; to inquire about the illness and know the location is called &#39;gong.&#39; The color, pulse, shape, and flesh should not be divorced from each other.

The scripture states that when the liver is painful and urgent, sweet foods should be consumed to soothe it; &#39;to soothe&#39; means to harmonize.]<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

When the pulse comes once with each breath and returns once, it is neither large nor small, called &quot;even.&quot; When there is one exhalation and three pulses, and one inhalation and three pulses, it indicates a moderate illness. If the pulse is larger at the front and smaller at the back, it results in headaches and dizziness; if smaller in front and larger in back, it leads to fullness in the chest and shortness of breath. When there is one exhalation and four pulses, and one inhalation and four pulses, it signals a worsening condition. A strong and large pulse indicates distress and fullness, while a deep and thin pulse causes abdominal pain. A slippery pulse signifies internal heat, while a rough pulse relates to fog or exposure. When the pulse comes with one exhalation and five pulses, and one inhalation and five pulses, the person is likely exhausted, with a deep and thin pulse worsening at night and a floating and large pulse worsening during the day. If the pulse is neither large nor small, although the person is fatigued, they can be treated. Those with fluctuating sizes are difficult to treat. When there is one exhalation and six pulses, and one inhalation and six pulses, it denotes a pulse leading to death; a deep thin pulse worsens at night, and a floating large pulse worsens during the day. When there is one exhalation and one pulse, and one inhalation and one pulse, it is called &quot;deficient&quot;; although a person can walk, they still feel the need to lie down. This is due to insufficient blood and qi. If there are two exhalations and two pulses, and breathing occurs again, it is termed &quot;no soul&quot;; without a soul, a person is close to death. Even if they can walk, it is called being a living corpse. </p>
<p>[Shuai Shou comments: One breath with four pulses signifies an even pulse.

The text elaborates that the pulse&#39;s condition worsens with each breath, with a distinction between daytime (yang) and nighttime (yin) patterns.

The upper part without pulses resembles dry tree branches; the lower part with pulses resembles a tree with roots. Only with roots can one expect life.</p>
<p>The Chen clan of Siming says: &quot;Zhi&quot; means advancement; yang thrives alone and becomes numerous; &quot;Sun&quot; means reduction; yin thrives alone and becomes few. The zhi pulse flows from bottom to top, indicating that without yin, yang moves alone. When it reaches the top, yang is also cut off and dies; the sun pulse flows from top to bottom, indicating that without yang, yin moves alone. When it reaches the bottom, yin is also depleted and dies.</p>
<p>One finds it difficult to interpret the pulse at the wrist to determine the life or death and fortunes of the organs, as the qi at the wrist corresponds to the five organs. One also finds it difficult to describe how the spleen receives the flavor of grains, with its pulse situated in the center, meaning that all five organs are centered around the stomach, whose pulse governs the upper connections. This difficulty in explaining one&#39;s measurements is comparable to a tree having roots; just as the pulse has a base, a person has original qi. Therefore, if one knows one cannot die, it is based on the measurements of the ruler.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fifteenth difficulty states: The classics mention spring is represented by the string, summer by the hook, autumn by the hair, and winter by the stone. Are these the pulse of a ruler or a sick pulse? Indeed. The string, hook, hair, and stone represent the pulses of the four seasons. </p>
<p>Spring, represented by the string, corresponds to the liver in the eastern wood. This is the time when all things begin to grow, and there are no branches or leaves yet; thus, the pulse comes softly and gently, hence it is called the string. </p>
<p>Summer, represented by the hook, corresponds to the heart in the southern fire. This is the time when all things flourish, with hanging branches and sprawling leaves, which bend downward like a hook; therefore, the pulse comes swiftly and goes slowly, hence it is called the hook. </p>
<p>Autumn, represented by the hair, corresponds to the lungs in the western metal. This is the time when all things come to an end, grasses and trees flower and their leaves fall; their branches remain like fine hair, so the pulse comes light and vacuous, hence it is called the hair. </p>
<p>Winter, represented by the stone, corresponds to the kidneys in the northern water. This is the time when all things are hidden; in the harsh winter, water solidifies like stone, so the pulse comes heavy and slippery, hence it is called the stone. These are the pulses of the four seasons. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: This is a compilation of the &quot;Internal Classic&quot; concerning the normal dynamics and the true organs, mixed in its text to form this chapter. The spring pulse as the string pertains to the liver&#39;s control over the tendons, representing the image of tendons. The summer pulse as the hook pertains to the heart&#39;s control over the blood vessels, representing the image of the coming and going of blood vessels. The autumn pulse as the hair pertains to the lungs&#39; control over the skin and hair. The winter pulse as the stone relates to the kidneys&#39; control over the bones. Each corresponds to its imagery, also incorporating the symbolic meaning of seasonal characteristics. The pulse comes swiftly and goes slowly; Liu Lizhi said: The incoming pulse arises from the division of flesh and bone, emerging at the skin&#39;s boundary, rising with Qi; the outgoing pulse retreats from the skin&#39;s boundary back to the division of flesh and bone, descending with Qi.]<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Autumn pulses are abundant like a cart cover, pressing them enhances the sensation, they feel fine; neither rising nor falling, like feeling chicken feathers, with many fine hairs; pressing them feels sparse, like hair blown by the wind, merely hair. Winter pulses are large above and smooth below, both sizes are balanced, solid yet harmonious; the up and down share the same essence, as discussed in the previous chapter; they connect in a pecking manner, slightly curved, with much solidity; coming like untangling a knot, going like flicking a stone, merely stone. Generally, the pulses of the four seasons all originate from the stomach qi; hence, with sufficient stomach qi, there is life, with little stomach qi, there is illness, and without stomach qi, there is death. Among the strings, hooks, hairs, and stones, there is always a gentle quality that represents stomach qi. This chapter has its similarities and differences from the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; </p>
<p>Feng says: The people of Yue want to make the pulse easier to understand, hence the emphasis on its meaning. According to the fifth volume of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; in the discussion of the characteristics of the balanced person, it states: The liver pulse comes soft and weak, flickering like the tip of a long pole. The lung pulse comes wearisome and listening, like falling catalpa pods. The kidney pulse comes with wheezing and heaviness, like a hook, firm when pressed; the pulse of a diseased kidney comes harder like a strong hemp, while the pulse of a dead kidney feels like the loss of a knot, brisk like flicking stone—these are the differences. </p>
<p>The stomach is the sea of water and grains, governing the four seasons, all deriving from stomach qi, hence referred to as the change in diseases of the four seasons, key points in life and death. </p>
<p>Hua Shou says: The stomach is associated with earth, which corresponds to the number five; all things return to it, hence it is called the sea of water and grains. Water, fire, metal, and wood all depend on it for existence, thus it governs the four seasons. &quot;Bing&quot; means to provide and to supply.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The spleen is the central region, its balance and harmony are not visible, only its decline can be seen. It comes like a bird&#39;s pecking, like water dripping through a leak; this is the manifestation of a weakened spleen. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: The spleen is the central region, referring to the space between breaths, where the spleen receives the flavors of grains, its pulse being in the middle. Its balance and harmony cannot be seen. The spleen governs the royal functions across the four seasons, but cannot solely master them. When the pulses of the four organs are balanced and harmonious, the spleen&#39;s pulse is also central. The decline manifests like a bird pecking at a roof, differing from the usual. The bird&#39;s pecking indicates a pulse that is strong and sharp but intermittent and uncertain; leaking water signifies a pulse that is slow, dispersed, moving but then ceasing.]</p>
<p>The &quot;Sixteen Difficulties&quot; states: The pulse has three sections and nine indicators, includes yin and yang, light and heavy, and sixty variations. One pulse transforms into the four seasons, having long since parted from the sage; each follows its own law. How, then, can we distinguish them? </p>
<p>[Xie said: This section raises six issues regarding the three sections and nine indicators, while the text does not answer the questions posed, suggesting there is missing text. Now, discussing the three sections and nine indicators, it should be found in the third chapter of the eighteen difficulties, indicating that this piece has mistakenly placed it here. Yin and yang refer to the fourth difficulty; light and heavy refer to the fifth difficulty; the transformation of one pulse into the four seasons discusses the spring string, summer hook, autumn hair, and winter stone in the fifteenth difficulty. As for the sixty variations, according to the “Inner Canon” in the section on flourishing and declining, it states: the sage holds to the way of diagnosis, considering yin and yang together, the patterns of the odd and constant, which yield the sixty variations. Wang&#39;s commentary states that the odd and constant yield sixty variations, now lost in the modern world, reflecting its long historical absence.]<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

<p>Indeed. Suppose one grasps the liver pulse; its external signs: good cleanliness, a bluish face, and a propensity for anger; its internal signs: movement in the left side of the abdomen, firm upon pressing and possibly painful; the illness presents with fullness in the limbs, difficulty in urination and defecation, and muscle cramps. If these are present, it is the liver; if they are not, it is not.<br>[Hua Shou said: Grasping the liver pulse also diagnoses the string-like pulse. The liver and gallbladder combine to form the clean and clear organ, hence good cleanliness. The liver is the general&#39;s organ, hence the propensity for anger. Happiness is akin to goodness and fondness. A bluish face reflects the color of the liver; these are favorable signs of color and pulse. The left side of the abdomen pertains to the liver; if firm upon pressing, it indicates the movement and firmness of qi, possibly causing pain. Feng noted: If liver qi (Yue Zhen) is constrained, there will be fullness in the limbs. The &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; states that wind will bring about latent illness. The jueyin pulse circulates along the yin organs, hence liver illness leads to difficulty in urination and defecation. Muscle cramps arise as the liver governs the sinews.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Indeed. The hand Taiyin (Yin Metal) corresponds to the Yangming (Metal), while the foot Shaoyin (Yin Water) corresponds to the Taiyang (Water). Metal produces Water, which flows downwards and cannot rise, hence it is in the lower part. The foot Jueyin (Yin Wood) corresponds to the Shaoyang (Yang Wood), which produces the hand Taiyang (Yang Fire) and Shaoyin (Yin Fire). Fire rises upward and cannot descend, thus it represents the upper part. The hand Xin (Heart) governs the Shaoyang (Yang Fire) and produces the foot Taiyin (Yin Earth) and Yangming (Earth), where Earth governs the central part. All of these signify the reciprocal generation and nurturing of the Five Elements.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou remarks: The hand Taiyin (Yin Metal) and foot Taiyang (Yin Water) are in the lower part because Water is inherently downward flowing. The foot Shaoyin (Yin Water) generates the foot Jueyin (Yin Wood), which in turn generates the hand Shaoyin (Yin Fire) and which governs the fire from the hand Xin. Fire ascends and thus represents the upper part. Fire generates the foot Taiyin (Yin Earth), which resides in the central part and further produces the Lung Metal. This dynamic illustrates the reciprocal generation and nurturing of the Five Elements. This can be interpreted as confirming the structure of the upper and lower parts according to the generative properties of the organs rather than waiting for a predetermined order of generation. Furthermore, there is an elaboration into a tripartite framework, referring to the four difficulties discussed: heart and lung being elevated, kidney and liver being lower, while the spleen symbolizes the central region. However, while the former strictly refers to the organs, this perspective includes both channels and organs.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse has three divisions and nine qualities; what does each govern? Indeed. The three divisions are the cun, guan, and chi.

The act of needling refers to detecting movement corresponding to the illness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Is the method for treating external stubborn diseases the same as for internal accumulation? It seems they are different.</p>
<p>Yes. When the pulse is stagnant, it stops irregularly when coming and going; this is called stagnation. When the pulse is hidden, it runs beneath the tendons; when the pulse is floating, it runs above the flesh. The methods are thus similar for both interior and exterior conditions.</p>
<p>If, for instance, the pulse is both stagnant and hidden, it indicates there is no internal accumulation; if the pulse is floating and stagnant, it indicates there is no external stubborn disease. If there is accumulation, the pulse will not be stagnated or hidden; if there is a stubborn disease, the pulse will not be floating or stagnant. This is a case where the pulse does not correspond to the disease, and the disease does not correspond to the pulse, which is classified as a terminal condition.</p>
<p>The nineteenth difficulty states: the classics mention that the pulse can be reversed or aligned. What does this mean?</p>
<p>The term &quot;aligned&quot; refers to constancy. The pulse can indeed be reversed or aligned, comparing the two genders.

A male&#39;s pulse at the wrist is usually weak, whereas a female&#39;s pulse at the wrist is often strong; this is the distinction between their pulses. Reversal refers to the opposite of their norm. Nonetheless, both genders have their respective consistencies. &quot;Reversal&quot; signifies a deviation from their usual state.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

Thus, the male pulse is consistently weak at the wrist, whereas the female pulse is consistently strong; this is their nature.</p>
<p>[Huá Shòu said: This relates to the origins of living beings, concerning the duality of male and female. The Jì family stated: At the beginning of life, everything originates from the zi, which is the source of all things. From zi, if we proceed left for men by thirty degrees, we arrive at sǐ; if we proceed right for women by twenty degrees, we also reach sǐ. This indicates the numerical principles of marriage between men and women. From sǐ, conception occurs: a man rotates left for ten months to be born in Yín, which is wood and yang; a woman rotates right for ten months to be born in Shēn, which is metal and yin. Xie said: Yín is wood, and wood generates fire; thus, fire arises from Yín and has an upward, fiery nature, so the male pulse is at the upper gate. Shēn is metal, and metal generates water; thus, water emerges from Shēn and flows downward, leading to the female pulse being at the lower gate. I humbly suggest that the yang body is light, clear, and ascends, in accordance with heavenly principles, thus the male pulse is at the upper gate; the yin body is heavy, turbid, and descends, in line with earthly principles, hence the female pulse is at the lower gate.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The reversal occurs when the male acquires the female pulse and the female acquires the male pulse. </p>
<p>What illness is associated with this? </p>
<p>Indeed, when the male acquires the female pulse, it indicates deficiency, with the ailment located within. If the pulse is left-sided, the illness is on the left; if right-sided, the illness is on the right. This is determined by the pulse. When the female acquires the male pulse, it signifies excess, with the ailment located in the extremities. If the pulse is left-sided, the illness is on the left; if right-sided, the illness is on the right. This is also determined by the pulse. </p>
<p>The difficulty in understanding this says that the abnormality leads to excess or deficiency, indicating internal or external ailments.</p>
<p>The twenty difficulties state: The classics mention that pulses can be hidden; what organs hide them? Indeed, this refers to the interplay of yin and yang. When the pulse is in the yin area and the yang pulse appears, it indicates yang surmounting yin; even if the pulse is occasionally deep and thin, this refers to yang hidden within yin. When the pulse is in the yang area and the yin pulse appears, it indicates yin surmounting yang; even if the pulse occasionally feels superficial and slippery, this refers to yin hidden within yang. </p>
<p>As indicated, &#39;within&#39; means it is present and should be so. The yin pulse is measured at the cun (inch), while the yang pulse is measured at the chi (foot). The term &#39;surmount&#39; is akin to riding atop a vehicle. The term &#39;hidden&#39; relates to the concealment of soldiers. &#39;To hide&#39; means to store away. The Ding family states that this does not only refer to the cun as yang and the chi as yin; when considering the upper and lower contexts, the muscles above correspond to the yang area, while those below correspond to the yin area. This also connects.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Twenty-First Hardship states: The classics say that when a person’s form is sick but their pulse is not, it is called life; when the pulse is sick but the form is not, it is called death. What does this mean? Indeed, if a person’s form is sick but their pulse is not, it does not mean there is nothing wrong. It refers to the breath not aligning with the pulse. This is a great principle. </p>
<p>Zhou Zhongli said: Within the body, one may feel haggard, the spirit foggy, appetite lacking for food, yet the pulse corresponds with the four seasons without any extremes; this is a case of the form being sick while the pulse is not. Conversely, if the form is stable and harmonious but the pulse fluctuates between strong and weak, comes and goes erratically, appears taut yet is floating and slippery, or is deep and turbid without consistency, this indicates the pulse is not in harmony with the form, showing that the pulse is sick while the person is not. </p>
<p>Zhongjing states: A person whose form is sick but pulse is not is termed internally empty, lacking vital energy; their spirit may be weary but not in pain. Conversely, a person whose pulse is sick but form is not is termed a &quot;walking corpse,&quot; lacking royal energy; they may suddenly faint, fail to recognize others, and die prematurely. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Twenty-Second Difficulty states: The classics say that there are movements in the meridians and diseases that arise. When one meridian transforms into two diseases, what is the reason? Indeed, the classics indicate that the movements refer to qi; the diseases that arise refer to blood. If the pathogen resides in qi, then qi causes the movement; if the pathogen resides in blood, then blood produces the resultant disease. Qi governs the respiration, while blood governs nourishment. If qi is stagnant and does not circulate, it indicates an initial disease of qi; if blood is obstructed and does not nourish, it indicates a subsequent disease of blood. Therefore, the movement occurs first, followed by the disease.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: &quot;Respiration&quot; refers to warmth; qi governs respiration, which means a person&#39;s true qi flows in and out, warming and evaporating between the skin and flesh. Blood governs nourishment, referring to the way a person&#39;s blood vessels moisten the muscles and bones, lubricating the joints and nourishing the organs. This term &#39;meridian&#39; does not refer to mere dimensions but rather to the pathways of the twelve meridians. It is stated that within each meridian, there are indeed two diseases because they are differentiated by the presences of qi and blood. If the pathogen is in qi, then qi causes the movement; if it is in blood, then blood produces the disease. Stagnation of qi indicates a disease of qi, while stagnation of blood demonstrates a blood disease; thus, the movement occurs first and the disease arises afterward. The sequence implies that qi is external and blood is internal; when the exterior first encounters the pathogen, does the interior also follow suit and become ill? Yet, pathogens may only reside in qi or directly in blood; we cannot bind ourselves strictly to the sequence.

The fifteen collateral vessels all originate from the twelve primary channels, irrigating one another, like a boundless loop, reaching the pulse at the wrist and the Renying point, which can address all ailments and decide life and death. The Renying point at the wrist is traditionally identified with the arteries moving alongside the throat; during the Jin dynasty, Wang Shuhe defined it as the point at a division of the left hand in relation to the pulse, while the right hand division became the Qikou point, and later generations followed this. I humbly believe the reason the ancients designated Renying and Qikou is that Renying corresponds to the foot Yangming stomach channel, which receives the essence of grains and nourishes the five organs, while Qikou corresponds to the hand Taiyin lung channel, which regulates and balances the hundred vessels.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Classic text states: Understanding the beginning and the end, the interplay of Yin and Yang is determined. What does this mean? Indeed, the beginning and the end refer to the regularity of the pulse. At the cun (寸) location, the Ren (人) pulse connects the energies of Yin and Yang, flowing like a seamless loop, hence it is called the beginning. The end signifies the severing of the three Yin and three Yang pulses; when they are severed, death occurs, and death takes various forms, hence it is called the end. </p>
<p>Hua Shou commented: According to the teachings of Xie, the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; (灵枢经) states in its ninth section that all methods of acupuncture conclude with the beginning and the end. Understanding the beginning and the end organizes the five organs, fixing the Yin and Yang. It also states: For those who are not ill, the pulse at the cun and Ren points responds to the four seasons; those with diminished energy will find both pulses weak and unresponsive to measurements. This section refers back to the previous mention of the cun and Ren pulses, which determines life and death across various diseases, suggesting that to grasp the beginning and end is to stabilize Yin and Yang. Essentially, the Yang meridians are determined by the Ren pulse, while the Yin meridians depend on the Qi pulse. The morning messenger signifies the harmony of Qi and blood, as tides rise according to the time, demonstrating the mutual use of Yin and Yang. The beginning is akin to the start of life, while the end represents the culmination of that life. To understand life and death, one must observe the pulse. The Qi of Yin and Yang flows into the morning messenger, like an unending loop, thus a person is free from illness; should there be any disruption in this flow, illness arises. Particularly, if the pulses of the three Yin and three Yang are severed, death is inevitable. The forms of death will be detailed in the following sections, which should be referenced accordingly.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

Indeed, when the lesser yin energy in the feet is gone, the bones become shriveled.

If bones and flesh are not close, the flesh becomes moist and recedes; when the flesh is moist and recoils, the teeth grow long and become brittle, and the hair lacks luster.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The thirty-eighth difficulty in articulating the Sanjiao (Triple Warmer) pertains to the differentiation of the original energy, which governs all energies, further emphasizing its name yet formless nature. The thirty-ninth difficulty in discussing the Mingmen (Gate of Life) refers to the place where spirit resides; in men, it stores essence, while in women, it connects to the womb, and this energy communicates with the kidneys. It is also stated that although there are six fu organs, there are actually five, and the Sanjiao is considered one of them. In the eight difficulties, as well as in the sixty-second and sixty-sixth chapters, it discusses the movement of energy within the kidneys, which is fundamental to human life and the root of the twelve meridians. This is called the original energy, and thus the Sanjiao serves as a vessel for this original energy. By understanding this text and examining their relationships, one can see how the Sanjiao fits into the definition of the six fu organs. It is solely because it has a name yet remains formless that it can align with the hand heart meridian. The heart rules the hand Jueyin, and its channel begins in the chest and ends at the tip of the little finger. In contrast, the hand Shaoyin begins in the heart and ends at the inner side of the little finger. Therefore, the hand Shaoyin and the heart each represent a distinct channel. Someone might ask, why does the hand Jueyin meridian refer to the heart and also to the heart protector? The answer is: the sovereign fire is named, while the ministerial fire is positioned.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The hand&#39;s yin aspect governs the heart&#39;s fire in action, thus it is called the heart&#39;s center; in terms of channels, it is called the pericardium. One channel has two names, both refer to the heart fire. Yu Shu states: Various schools say the gate of life is the heart fire, related to the sanjiao (triple warmer) in its inner and outer relationships. However, in the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; it only refers to the heart center and the sanjiao without mentioning the gate of life in relation to the sanjiao. </p>
<p>The left wrist corresponds to fire, the right to metal; the left gate corresponds to wood, the right to earth; the left inch corresponds to water, the right to fire. The placement and meaning of these are evidently clear! According to Yu’s view, the heart center and sanjiao are interrelated and govern the action of the heart fire. The thirty-six difficult questions mention that the energy of the gate of life connects with the kidneys, suggesting it is not separate from the kidneys. Is this not referred to as the &quot;trigram of water&quot;? The heart center represents a position of fire, while the gate of life expresses a shared energy of water. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The discussion of the Yu school is indeed profound! The reason various schools are confused and indecisive is likely due to their misunderstanding of the &quot;True Words of the Golden Coffer,&quot; where Wang&#39;s annotations cite the &quot;Rectification Theory&quot; indicating that the San Jiao (Triple Warmer) is named yet formless, connecting the Heart Master above and the Right Kidney below, which leads to the concept of the San Jiao relating to the Life Gate. </p>
<p>The organs of a person have both Yin and Yang, and are respectively paired; how could there be a theory of one channel pairing with two? The notion that it connects with the Heart Master above truly implies a relationship of exterior and interior; the connection with the Right Kidney below refers to the San Jiao as the distinct envoy of Original Qi. Understanding this clarifies that the Life Gate connects with the Kidney and that there cannot be dual pairing for the San Jiao. Hence, the various claims can be discerned and made clear without confusion.</p>
<p>Regarding pulse diagnosis, the Hand Jueyin (Liver) Fire resides at the right wrist, and the San Jiao is the same. Since the Life Gate connects with the Kidney, it should be at the left wrist. Yet, Xie states in the &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; that the Hand Jueyin is at the same location as the Hand Shaoyin (Heart) pulse; the San Jiao pulse appears at the inch, is evident in the pass, and links with the Kidney at the lower Jiao. Previously, it was stated that the left and right Kidneys should not divide the pulses of the hands and feet, so how should the right wrist be examined according to what the &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; states?<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Thirty Difficulties&quot; states: Is the function of the nourishing qi always accompanied by the protective qi? Indeed. The classics mention that food enters the stomach, then is transmitted to the five organs and six bowels; all five organs and six bowels receive qi. The pure essence is for nourishment, and the turbid essence is for protection. Nourishing qi circulates within the meridians, while protective qi flows outside them, nourishing ceaselessly, reaching fifty and then returning to great harmony, where yin and yang interlink, like a seamless circle. Hence, it is known that nourishment and protection accompany each other.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: This passage aligns with the words of the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; chapter eighteen. While food enters the stomach and is transmitted to the five organs and six bowels, the “Spiritual Pivot” states that it enters the lungs, with the five organs and six bowels all receiving qi, which is somewhat different. All receive the essence of qi, referring to the qi from water and grain. The return to great harmony at fifty is discussed in one of the difficulties. The Chen family of Siming said: Nourishment is yin, its movement is inherently slow; protection is yang, its movement is inherently fast. However, the pure is smooth and effective, while the turbid is vigorous and forceful; neither is sluggish in form. Thus, when protective qi moves outside, nourishing qi follows within, indicating their movement is consistently accompanied, encompassing their measure.</p>
<p>The Wang family of HunNan said: The pure is the essence of the body, it is yang, it is fire; one aspect of yin descends from the center, thus, after noon, one yin is born, this refers to the heart producing blood, therefore it is said that the pure qi is for nourishment. [The clear of heaven does not descend, the turbid of earth can descend through the six yin, driving it downward.

<p>I humbly suggest that in terms of application, pure qi represents the essence, being the pure part within the turbid; while turbid qi, serving as the guardian, is the turbid part within the pure. Speaking of essence, the use of the pure does not separate from the essence of the turbid, and the use of the turbid does not separate from the essence of the pure.

Someone asked about the Thirty-Two Difficulties: &#39;Blood is for the nutritive essence, and qi is for the protective energy.

It further states that the clear energy is for the nutritive essence, while the turbid energy is for the protective essence. Generally speaking, both the nutritive and protective essence are functions of the energy from food and water, so it is appropriate to refer to them using the term qi. However, when analyzed in detail, the nutritive essence refers to blood and the protective essence to qi, which have their distinct roles.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Difficulties of Bian Que: Volume on the Lower Jiao</strong></p>
<p><strong>Difficulty Thirty-One:</strong> What is the nature of the San Jiao (Three Jiao)? How does it originate and how does it conclude? Where does its treatment normally take place? Can this be elucidated? Yes. The San Jiao is the pathway of food and fluid, where Qi begins and ends. The Upper Jiao is located beneath the heart, above the diaphragm, within the stomach, governing internal matters without release, its treatment is in the Zhongji (central vessel), one and a half inches below the Xuanfu (suspended hall) between the two breasts. The Middle Jiao is in the middle of the stomach, neither ascending nor descending, governing the fermentation of food and fluid, its treatment lies beside the navel. The Lower Jiao is at the entrance of the bladder, governing the differentiation of clear and turbid, promoting outflow rather than influx to facilitate the pathway, its treatment is one inch below the navel. Thus, it is called the Three Jiao, whose cavities are in the pathways of Qi.</p>
<p>[Slightly different interpretation: The term &quot;pathway&quot; may also be written as &quot;Chong&quot;.] </p>
<p>[Hua Shou stated: The organs and viscera of the human body possess form and shape, have nature and life, such as the liver obtaining Qi from wood and generating from water, and the heart obtaining Qi from fire and generating from wood, and this applies universally. Only the San Jiao is formless, and what it receives and generates is merely the Yuan Qi (original Qi) and the stomach Qi, hence it is described as the pathway of food and fluid, where Qi begins and ends. The treatment of the Upper Jiao is in the Zhongji, the treatment of the Middle Jiao is at the Tianshu point beside the navel, and the treatment of the Lower Jiao is at the Yinjiao point one inch below the navel. “Treatment” is akin to “govern”, similar to the governance of prefectures and counties, referring to the areas of the San Jiao. Some say to pronounce &#39;treatment&#39; with a level tone, suggesting that when there is illness in the San Jiao, each section should be treated accordingly, implying needling methods. The San Jiao represents the fire of the heart; fire can ferment and mature all things, and &#39;Jiao&#39; relates to the essence of fermentation, hence the naming and meaning may derive from this.]<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

Hence, at fifty degrees, it converges again at the hand of Taiyin. The middle focus is also adjacent to the stomach&#39;s entrance; after the emergence from the upper focus, it receives the air, processes the dregs, steams the fluid, transforms its essence, and ascends into the lung meridian, being refined into blood to nourish the body. Nothing is more precious than this, so it uniquely circulates through the meridian pathways, and is referred to as Yingqi (Nutritive Qi).

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, the water and grain are constantly combined in the stomach, transforming into dregs that descend together into the large and small intestines to form the lower jiao. They seep down, mixing and separating the juices, following the lower jiao to penetrate the bladder. Xie states: By examining the text of the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; it becomes evident that the three jiaos have names but no tangible form. Ancient scholar Yuan says: The so-called three jiaos reside within the fatty tissues of the diaphragm, in the spaces between the five organs and six bowels, where water and grain flow and transform. Their qi merges within, steaming and affecting the diaphragm, spreading to the skin and flesh, circulating to all sides, referred to as upper, middle, and lower, each named according to its respective region, essentially being agents of the original qi. Therefore, although they lack physical form, they take their names from the inner and outer forms; and although they lack substantiality, they occupy positions by combining inner and outer realities. I foolishly note that the phrase regarding their location in the channels seems to be erroneous or extended. The three jiaos naturally belong to the various organs, with their channels being associated with the hand&#39;s lesser yang, and connected to the hand&#39;s heart, each having its own therapeutic locale, and should not be considered as additional organs.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When it is sufficiently matured, the fire’s essence is removed, and the yin wood (乙) returns to the yang metal (庚), causing the essence of metal to naturally sink. The ancient scholar Yuan said: the liver represents the yin wood (乙), and the lungs represent the yin metal (辛), corresponding to their respective sounds. The combination of 乙 and 庚, and that of 丙 and 辛, resembles a marital relationship. Thus, they temporarily relinquish their inherent natures to follow the influences of their partners&#39; essences, demonstrating the interaction of yin and yang. Moreover, the liver is located below the diaphragm, while the lungs reside above; the upper is yang and the lower is yin. Their pathways express differentiation, causing wood to float and reflect the sinking nature of metal, while metal sinks and reflects the upward movement of fire. Everything, when reaching its extreme, will reverse, and when it undergoes transformation and change, it returns to its origin and its true nature. Hence, when the liver and lungs mature, they each manifest the inherent nature of wood and metal. The Ji school states: the liver is the yang within yin, having a predominant yin quality and does not conform to wood, thus it sinks with water. The lungs are the yin within yang, having a predominant yang quality and do not conform to metal, thus they float with water. This refers to their larger aspects.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When they become熟 (ripe) and the processes of settling and floating reverse, each returns to its origin, hence they reveal their true nature. The Zhou school says: the liver stores blood, which is the essence of Yin; having more blood and less Qi, its body becomes congealed and obstructed. Although there are meridians and internal pathways, they cannot compare to the exquisite emptiness, therefore it sinks when water is present. When熟, the moist and nourishing aspect transitions to dryness; the congealed and obstructed transforms into an unobstructed void, suitable for floating. The lungs govern Qi, which is Yang; having more Qi and less blood, its body hangs down and is light, with openings and passages that are exquisite; the meridians branch out, hence it floats when water is present. When熟, the body tightens and contracts; the openings become obstructed and solid; those that were lightly expansive transform into tightness, which is suitable for sinking. This natural principle aligns with the subtle transformations of the five elements. Xie says: this reasoning derives from the nature of things. I humbly assert that the liver is Yang, a form of Yang within Yin; since Yin is more abundant, it is called微阳 (subtle Yang), residing below and following the Yin path. The lung is Yin, a form of Yin within Yang; since Yang is more abundant, it is called微阴 (subtle Yin), residing above and following the Yang path. When熟, it loses all delight and returns to its essence, why is this? Because when things become熟, the mingling of energies disperses.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></p></div>

The body is the complement of essence; it enters and exits in conjunction with essence and is called the body. The spirit is the transformation of essence; when two essences are thin together, it is called spirit. The spleen governs thinking, thus storing intention and wisdom.

Indeed, the two are not both considered kidneys; the left one is the kidney, while the right one is the Mingmen. The Mingmen is the dwelling of the spirits and the connection to the original Qi. For men, it is where essence is stored, and for women, it is where the womb is connected. Thus, it is known that the kidneys have one aspect.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou commented: The kidneys have two aspects, with the left being the kidney and the right being the Mingmen. Men store essence here and receive the essences of the five organs and six bowels; women connect to the womb here, allowing them to receive essence and facilitate transformation. The original Qi refers to the moving Qi between the kidneys below the navel, the essence of life for humans, and the root of the twelve meridians. This text indicates that not both are kidneys; the thirty-ninth difficulty also states the left is the kidney and the right is the Mingmen, asserting that their Qi connects with the kidneys, demonstrating that the two aspects are essentially one.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states that qi travels independently within the five organs and does not participate in the six bowels. Why is this so? Indeed, the path of qi is like water flowing without pause. Hence, the yin channels circulate in the five organs, while the yang channels nourish the six bowels, forming a loop with no end that is hard to track. It ends and begins again, unspilling and overflowing. The qi within a person remains warm in the organs and moist externally in the skin.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: This extrapolates from the previous chapter’s discussion on “nourishing.” It is similar to the seventeenth chapter of the &quot;Lingshu.&quot; When it is said that qi travels independently in the five organs and does not nourish the six bowels, it does not mean that it does not nourish the six bowels; rather, in the yin channels it nurtures the five organs, and in the yang channels it nourishes the six bowels.

If the yin channels are vigorous, it implies that the yin qi is concentrated below; if the yang channels are vigorous, then the yang qi is blocked above, but this does not lead to death. When both yin and yang are vigorous, there is both blockage and constraint, resulting in vomiting and food not being ingested, while both yin closes off, preventing bowel movements and consequently leading to death.

The nose is a proxy of the lungs, allowing an understanding of fragrance and odor, while the ears are a proxy of the kidneys, enabling the perception of sound. What does this mean? Indeed, the lungs represent metal in the west. Metal is generated in the hours of the snake, which corresponds to the fire of the south. Fire relates to the heart, which governs odor, hence allowing the nose to discern fragrance and odor. The kidneys represent water in the north. Water is generated in the hours of the monkey, which corresponds to metal in the west. Metal corresponds to the lungs, which govern sound, thus allowing the ears to perceive sound. </p>
<p>[Huashou remarks: The Fourth Ming Chen family states that odor is governed by the heart, the nose is the orifice of the lungs, and as the heart’s vessels connect to the lungs, this gives the nose the ability to discern fragrance and odor. The ears are the orifice of the kidneys, and sound is governed by the lungs; thus, as the vessels of the kidneys connect to the lungs, this allows the ears to hear sound. I foolishly note that the perspectives of the Yue people likely arise from the principle of the generative cycle of the five elements, further exhibiting their interdependence and utility.]<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The forty-first difficulty states: The liver has only two lobes; how does it respond? Indeed. The liver is associated with the east and wood, and wood represents spring. As all things begin to grow, they are still young and unattached, remaining close to the moon and not far from the sun. Therefore, it possesses dual characteristics, hence the two lobes, which correspond to the leaves of wood.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The Chen family of Siming notes: The interrelation of the five organs is like the way of mother and child. Thus, the kidney is the mother of the liver, belonging to the greater yin; the heart is the child of the liver, belonging to the greater yang. The position of the liver is close to the kidney and not far from the heart either. I foolishly believe that the liver’s two lobes correspond to the wood of the east, representative of spring when all things begin to grow, symbolizing the dual leaves of plants. People from Yue occasionally observe this and establish discussions around it, yet it isn’t absolute; it isn’t completely false either. When discussing the greater yin and greater yang, it need not refer strictly to the organs and seasonal phenomena, but rather that the depth of winter represents the peak of yin and early summer signifies the height of yang. Referring to them as greater yin and greater yang is not inappropriate. In general, when studying, one must be flexible and vibrant, not stagnant or muddled. The ancients referred to aligning intention with will, which signifies understanding, indeed. The latter section mentions the liver having three lobes on the left and four on the right; this mention of two lobes simply sums up the larger ones.]<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The forty-third difficulty states: If a person does not eat or drink for seven days and dies, what is the reason? Indeed. A person&#39;s stomach should contain two dou of grains and one dou and five sheng of water. Thus, an average person defecates twice a day, approximately two and a half sheng each time, totaling five sheng at midday. In seven days, that amounts to five times seven, which is three dou and five sheng, and thus the water and grains are entirely depleted. Therefore, if an average person does not eat or drink for seven days, when the water and grains and their fluids are all exhausted, death occurs.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou states: This section is similar to the thirtieth chapter of &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; When the stomach is full, the intestines are empty; when the intestines are full, the stomach is empty. This fluctuation leads to the proper flow of qi, stabilizing the five organs, harmonizing the blood vessels, and allowing the spirit to reside, for the spirit is the essence of the water and grains. Therefore, if an average person does not eat or drink for seven days, all the water, grains, and their fluids are completely depleted. Hence, it is said that when water departs, nourishment disperses, and when grains are consumed, protection is lost.

Blood converges at the Geyu point; blood is governed by the heart and stored in the liver. The Ge point is located below the seventh vertebra on both sides; above, it corresponds to the heart, and below, it corresponds to the liver, thus it is the convergence of blood.

<p>[Huashou comments: In the fourth chapter of the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; it is stated that the head and face relate to the body’s form, belonging to the bones, connected by tendons, sharing blood, and united in Qi. When the heavens are cold, the earth cracks, and ice forms. Consequently, if hands and feet feel lethargic from the extreme cold, why does the face not cover up? Qibo says: The twelve primary meridians and three hundred sixty-five collateral pathways all have blood and Qi ascending to the face, moving through the orifices. The refined Yang Qi ascends to the eyes to form sight; the auxiliary Qi moves to the ears for hearing; the ancestral Qi rises from the nose for smell; the turbid Qi emerges from the stomach, travels through the lips and mouth for taste; and all the Qi and fluids ascend and steam the face. Additionally, the skin is thick, and the flesh is firm; thus, extreme heat and severe cold cannot overcome it. I humbly analyze that the three Yang channels from the hand run up to the head, the three Yang channels from the foot run down to the foot, the three Yin channels from the abdomen run to the hand, and the three Yin channels from the foot enter the abdomen.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Words represent the void; when the internal organs become ill, it does not arise from external pathogens, hence the mind is clear and speech is not hindered. Those who do not speak represent the real; when a person harbors internal pathogenic qi, they become confused and do not speak. Those who are slow represent the void; slowness indicates they are not urgent, and what emerges from within is gradual and delayed, not a condition developed overnight. Those who are urgent represent the real; this speaks to illnesses caused by external pathogens like wind, cold, heat, etc., with life and death at stake between five and six days. This describes the reality of the illness&#39;s void and real aspects. </p>
<p>To diagnose is to assess and observe. By examining the outside, one comes to know it, not merely by pulse diagnosis. Softness indicates the void, firmness indicates the real; these two sentences are not found in the classic texts, although the Xie family believes them to be later additions. Yang’s interpretation states that when the skin and flesh are soft and moist, it signifies the void, while tightness and strength indicate the real; thus, the presence of either does no harm. </p>
<p>When palpating the area of illness, if the painful spot is discerned, it indicates the real; thus, if it is not painful but itchy, it is not the real condition. Additionally, if there is external pain but internal ease, it signifies that the pathogen is strong externally; conversely, if there is internal pain but external ease, it suggests the pathogen is strong internally. Generally, when pathogenic qi is vigorous, it is the real; when vital essence is depleted, it is the void. This explains the diagnosis of the void and the real.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

Indeed, anxiety and worry injure the heart; exposure to cold and drinking cold liquids injure the lungs; anger and excessive emotions that rise without descending injure the liver; overindulgence in food and fatigue injure the spleen; prolonged sitting on damp ground or overexertion in water injure the kidneys. These are afflictions of the regular channels.</p>
<p>Huashou says: The heart governs thought and is the sovereign’s organ, thus anxiety and worry injure the heart. The lungs govern the skin and hair and are considered delicate organs, hence exposure to cold and drinking cold liquids injure the lungs. The liver governs anger, and anger injures the liver. The spleen governs eating, drinking, and the limbs, so overindulgence in food and fatigue injure the spleen. The kidneys govern the bones and are associated with water; therefore, excessive effort and sitting in damp conditions injure the kidneys.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Worry and thought, anger, eating and drinking, actions—these are things that no one can be without. When they are expressed in moderation, they cause no harm; if excessive, they will certainly injure a person. Therefore, those who are good at preserving life avoid extremes and seek a middle path. The ignorant, however, become fixated and wish to reject everything, which is not sensible at all! This is similar to the fourth chapter of the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; but differs in that it mentions a condition where one becomes hurt in the spleen due to sweating from being drunk and exposed to the wind, which is not the same.</p>
<p>Xie states: Eating and drinking and labor and fatigue are indeed two different matters. When eating and drinking are well-timed, one feels hunger and satiety. Labor and fatigue arise from overexertion and lead to exhaustion. The fundamental principle here indicates that illness comes from within the body, not from external pathogens, which is what is meant by &quot;internal injury.&quot; Some might say that sitting in dampness or entering water is also something acquired from outside, so why is this considered an internal illness? The reply is that this is not one of the six external evils of nature.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Hua Shou said: Wind corresponds to wood and tends to injure the liver. Heat corresponds to fire and tends to injure the heart. Earth is related to agriculture, and the spleen governs the limbs, therefore dietary labor tends to injure the spleen. Cold corresponds to metal and tends to injure the lungs.

The heart is associated with odors; when injured by heat, it produces a burnt smell, a fragrant smell when affecting the spleen, a rancid smell when affecting the liver, a rotten smell when affecting the kidneys, and a fishy smell when affecting the lungs. Therefore, we understand that heart conditions from summer heat are accompanied by foul odors. The patient experiences body heat, agitation, and pain in the heart, with a pulse that is floating, large, and scattered. </p>
<p>[Huá Shòu commented: The heart is associated with odors; when the heart is damaged by summer heat, it faces illness, hence the aversion to foul smells, and the symptoms and pulse diagnosis all pertain to the heart.]</p>
<p>How do we know that issues from diet and fatigue arise? Yes, it is characterized by a preference for bitter tastes, with deficiency leading to loss of appetite and abundance leading to increased appetite. How can we explain this? The spleen governs tastes; when it affects the liver, it produces a sour taste; when it affects the heart, a bitter taste; when it affects the lungs, a spicy taste; when it affects the kidneys, a salty taste; and when it affects itself, a sweet taste. Thus, we know that spleen dysfunction affecting the heart leads to a preference for bitter tastes.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>How can we know if the illness is due to Cold Damage? Indeed, it comes with delirious speech. How do we say this? The lungs govern sound; when the evil enters the heart, it causes confusion in speech; when it enters the liver, it leads to weeping; when it enters the heart, it results in speech; when it enters the spleen, it manifests as song; when it enters the kidneys, it brings out moans; and when it enters oneself, it leads to crying.

<p>What indicates that the illness is due to Internal Dampness? Indeed, there is a tendency to sweat that cannot be stopped. How do we discern this? The kidneys govern dampness; when it enters the liver, it leads to tears; when it enters the heart, it leads to sweating; when it enters the spleen, it leads to saliva; when it enters the lungs, it causes nasal discharge; and when it enters oneself, it results in spittle. Hence, it is understood that the kidney&#39;s evil entering the heart causes sweating that cannot be stopped. The symptoms are body heat accompanied by pain in the lower abdomen, cold extremities, and a pulse that is submerged, moist, and large. This describes the principles of the Five Evils.</p>

How can one distinguish between them? The later ones are called virtual pathogens, the earlier ones are called real pathogens, those that are overwhelming are called marauding pathogens, those that are dominated are called subtle pathogens, and those that arise from the patient themselves are called correct pathogens.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? For instance, in the case of heart diseases: a stroke that comes afterward is a virtual pathogen, heat stroke that occurs as the main illness is a correct pathogen, illness due to dietary strain or fatigue that comes from the front is a real pathogen, a cold injury that arises from being overcome is a subtle pathogen, and dampness that comes from what one cannot withstand is a marauding pathogen. </p>
<p>Using the heart as an example clarifies the above meaning. A stroke as a virtual pathogen comes afterwards, with fire in front and wood behind. A heat stroke as a correct pathogen is derived from the illness itself (fire). Dietary strain or fatigue is a real pathogen, coming from the front (earth in front and fire behind). A cold injury is a subtle pathogen, stemming from what one is vanquished by (fire overcomes metal). Dampness is a marauding pathogen, arising from what one cannot withstand (water restraining fire).

<p>[The Ding clan states: Diseases of the organs are yin, and yin represents stillness, hence they are fixed and do not move.

For example, if the heart disease transmits to the lungs, the lungs transmit to the liver, the liver transmits to the spleen, the spleen transmits to the kidneys, and the kidneys transmit back to the heart, if no organ suffers further damage, it is stated that the seven transmissions result in death.</p>
<p>[The Ji clan states: The heart fire transmits to the lung metal, the lung metal transmits to the liver wood, the liver wood transmits to the spleen earth, the spleen earth transmits to the kidney water, and the kidney water transmits back to the heart fire. The heart fire receiving the transmission from water counts as one; the lung metal receiving the transmission from fire counts as two.

<p>[Hua Shou says: Lü Shi states that the transmission among organs occurs through the organ that it overcomes. The heart overcomes the lungs, thus the spleen transmits to the lungs; the spleen overcomes the kidneys, thus the lungs transmit to the kidneys; the lungs overcome the liver, thus the kidneys transmit to the liver; the kidneys overcome the heart, thus the liver transmits to the heart; and the liver overcomes the spleen, thus the heart transmits to the spleen. This is what is meant by the transmission of what gives rise to life. I humbly note that in the &quot;Su Wen&quot; on the theory of transmission of primary and secondary ailments, it states: Observe the intervals closely and adjust accordingly. The intervals signify mutual functioning, whereas &quot;excess&quot; indicates singular action. The mutual functioning signifies a joint transmission, transmitting what it overlaps, which is similar to Lü Shi&#39;s explanation. Singular action signifies a distinctive transmission towards what is overcome, as described in Ji Shi&#39;s argument. The principle of the Yue people fundamentally arises from this, detailed in this chapter and in the 42nd chapter of &quot;Ling Shu.&quot; However, the principle in these two texts indicates that the transmission occurs among the five organs, along with the stomach and bladder, totaling seven. They elaborate their examples, and each text is named for the transmission of ailments. Now, the Yue people refer to the seven transmissions among the organs, elucidating the principles from these two texts, using the heart as an example to demonstrate the mutual transmission of ailments. If transmission occurs towards what is overcome, and a single organ suffers twice, it results in death; if it is an interval of overcoming, as a mutual transmission between child and mother, it leads to life.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Fifty-Fourth Problem states: Diseases of the organs are difficult to treat, while diseases of the bowels are easy to treat. What does this mean? Indeed, the difficulty in treating organ diseases arises because they transmit what overcomes them; conversely, bowel diseases are easy to treat because they transmit what they produce. Treatment approaches for both organs and bowels share similarities in the context of the seven transmissions.</p>
<p>Hua Shou remarks: Chen from Siming states that the five organs are guarded internally by the seven spirits, hence the subtle invasions are not easily transmitted. When substantial qi enters, the spirits lose their guard, leading to deeper illness, making treatment challenging, possibly even resulting in death. The six bowels are involved in the processes of transfer and transformation; their qi remains constantly open. Moreover, the gallbladder, being a clear and pure space, makes it difficult for pathogens to linger deep, thus bowel diseases are easier to treat. </p>
<p>From the perspective of the Yue people, it can be interpreted that the difficulty in treating organ diseases comes from their ability to transmit what overcomes them, while bowel diseases are easier to treat since they transmit what they generate. However, this is merely one aspect of their nature. If organ diseases transmit what they generate, they would also be easy to treat, and if bowel diseases transmit what overcomes them, they would become difficult to treat. Hence, Pang Anchang often said that among the medical texts of this world, only the words of Bian Que hold depth, which is what the &quot;Nanjing&quot; refers to. </p>
<p>The Yue people embed skills within their writings; if there are unclear parts, they encourage future generations to seek deeper understanding, right? Now, with this text, it can be said that Pang has truly grasped the essence of the Yue people.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fifty-fifth difficulty states: Diseases can be classified as accumulation or congestion; how can we distinguish between them? Indeed, accumulation pertains to yin qi, while congestion pertains to yang qi. Therefore, accumulation is deep and latent, while congestion is superficial and active. The place where qi accumulates is called accumulation, and the place where qi gathers is called congestion. Thus, accumulation arises from the five viscera, while congestion is produced by the six bowels. Accumulation, being yin qi, has a fixed place of origin; its pain does not stray from its region, with a clear beginning and end, both upward and downward, as well as boundaries to the left and right. Congestion, being yang qi, lacks a fundamental origin; it has no fixed point to pause, and its pain is variable in location, which is why it is termed congestion. Hence, this is how we differentiate between accumulation and congestion.</p>
<p>[Shu Shou remarked: Accumulation arises from the five viscera, which are associated with yin and represent stillness; therefore, its ailments are deep-seated and do not leave their location. Congestion comes from the six bowels, which are associated with yang and represent movement; hence, its ailments are superficial and do not remain in one place.]</p>
<p>[Yang commented: Accumulation means storage, indicating that when the flow of blood and qi is obstructed, it leads to disease.]</p>
<p>[Zhou Zhongli stated: The deep and latent nature of accumulation is initially imperceptible, gradually growing and building up over time. Congestion, on the other hand, is where the disease manifests, occurring coincidentally with blood and qi, thus it lacks a constant location, in agreement with the concepts of the fifty-second difficulty.]<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The fifty-sixth difficulty states: Are there specific names for the accumulations in the five organs? On what days and months are they obtained? Indeed. The accumulation of the liver is called &quot;fat qi,&quot; located beneath the left rib, resembling an overturned cup, with a head and foot. If it endures for a long time, it can cause coughing and reverse flow, leading to malaria that persists for years. It is obtained on the Wujia days of late summer. How can this be explained? Lung disease transmits to the liver, which should transmit to the spleen. In late summer, the ruler’s body does not accept evils; hence, the liver wants to return to the lung, but the lung refuses to accept it, resulting in a blocked accumulation, thus one knows that fat qi is obtained on the Wujia days of late summer. </p>
<p>[Huashou says: &quot;Fat&quot; refers to fullness. The presence of a head and foot indicates a significant beginning and end. Cough and reverse flow are the distinctions of the foot jueyin, passing through the diaphragm to the lung. Liver disease causes coughing in the chest. Malaria occurs every two days; according to the Inner Canon, all five organs can have malaria, and here it is associated with wind malaria in the liver. Furthermore, malaria represents cold and heat diseases, mostly belonging to the lesser yang; the liver corresponds in both surface and interior, hence it is said to be beneath the left rib, the region of the liver.]</p>
<p>The accumulation of the heart is called &quot;fuliang,&quot; arising above the navel, as large as an arm, extending up to below the heart. If it endures for a long time, it causes vexation of the heart. It is obtained on the Gengxin days of autumn. How can this be explained? Kidney disease transmits to the heart, which should transmit to the lung. The lung, in autumn, aligns with the ruler&#39;s body, and the ruler does not accept evils; thus, the heart wishes to return to the kidney, but the kidney refuses, resulting in a blocked accumulation, hence one knows that fuliang is obtained on the Gengxin days of autumn. </p>

If it does not heal for a long time, it causes the limbs to become retracted, leads to jaundice, and impedes the nourishment to the skin. It is brought about by the winter days of Ren and Gui. Why is this said? Diseases of the liver pass to the spleen, while the spleen should pass to the kidneys. The kidneys correspond with the winter, and a sovereign does not accept evil influences; the spleen wishes to return to the liver, but the liver refuses to accept it, hence it remains as an accumulation. Thus, phlegm-qi is known to arise from the winter days of Ren and Gui. </p>
<p>[Huashou commented: Phlegm-qi is a blockage that does not flow. Jaundice refers to yellowing. Damp heat causes jaundice.]</p>
<p>The accumulation of the lungs is called &quot;xi-bin,&quot; located under the right rib, as large as a cup.

Diseases of the heart pass to the lungs, while the lungs should pass to the liver.

<p>[Huashou commented: Xi-bin can manifest as either &quot;xi&quot; or &quot;bin.&quot; The lung area under the right rib is associated with the skin and hair, hence the sensations of cold and heat. While it is said that organ diseases do not transfer but remain, the lung accumulation may manifest variably; this is because the lungs govern qi. Hence, the ailments may act periodically.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The accumulation in the kidneys is called &quot;ben tun,&quot; which emerges from the lower abdomen and rises to beneath the heart, resembling a pig. It can shift upwards or downwards at any time. If it persists for a long time, it causes wheezing, reverse breathing, bone atrophy, and shortness of breath. It is gained on the days of Bing and Ding in the summer. Why is it said this way? The disease of the spleen transmits to the kidneys, and the kidneys are supposed to transmit to the heart; when the heart governs summer, the sovereign does not accept evil influences, so the kidneys want to return to the spleen, but the spleen will not accept it, resulting in an accumulation. Thus, it is known that &quot;ben tun&quot; is gained in the summer on the days of Bing and Ding. This is the essential method for the five accumulations.</p>
<p>Hua Shou said: &quot;Ben tun&quot; is not fixed like the protrusions of a pig; the nature of the pig is restless, hence its name. The cause of wheezing and reverse breathing is the channel of the foot shaoyin, which originates from the lungs and connects to the heart, entering the chest. It is difficult to speak only of the diseases of the viscera without mentioning the diseases of the bowels; Ji&#39;s theory states this is because it does not manifest in a constant place. Yang&#39;s theory suggests that the six bowels also transmit one another, just as the five viscera do. </p>
<p>If one asks about the principles of things in the world, there is sensation and transmission; sensation is feeling, and transmission is qi. Where there is feeling, there is sensation; where there is qi, there is transmission. Now, the accumulation in the five viscera arises specifically because the qi overwhelms what cannot be transmitted.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for a ruler not being influenced by corruption, that is indeed true. However, if one is unable to prevail, they may desire to return to that which they have conquered. If the conquered do not accept this and instead hold on, this would indicate an emotional response. Moreover, the five organs within the human body each function as a distinct entity, akin to how the ears serve hearing and the eyes serve sight, each having their own roles but lacking thought; unlike humans, who engage with their surroundings with the heart as the master, guided by the dynamics of energy. Therefore, do the five organs truly possess emotions and responses? It is said that the thoughts of the people of Yue are based on the principles of the five elements, interpreted and articulated; initially, there is no need to argue about their emotions and responses, nor whether they reciprocate, as this is inherently unnecessary. For readers, simply consider the dynamic of conquering and not conquering, alongside the ruler’s resistance to corruption, leading to the accumulation of observations. This way, one can contemplate without letting language impair intent and think beyond the norm. Should anyone question the transmission of emotions and responses through energy, referencing the words of the earlier sages; it is said that the interaction of form influences the response of energy, so energy is indeed capable of responding. How does this relate to your words? It is stated that the teachings of earlier sages, although discussing energy’s responses, stem from the interaction of form.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is also said that the yang pulse is floating and slippery, while the yin pulse is moist and weak; when encountering wind, it transforms into wind-heat. According to Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s examples, wind-heat aligns with the pulses described in the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; without mentioning damp-heat. Furthermore, it is said in the &quot;Nan Jing&quot; that warm diseases refer to the warm malaria, wind-heat, warm toxin, and warm epidemic mentioned in Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Shang Han Lun.&quot; The people of Yue discuss its general concept but do not delve into details, while Zhang Zhongjing reveals its secrets and categorizes the pulses, which can be considered thorough. </p>
<p>Pang Anchang in the &quot;General Treatise on Cold Damage&quot; states that the &quot;Nan Jing&quot; records five types of cold damage, discussing the pulses of warm diseases found across various channels, but it is unclear which channel&#39;s movement is being referred to, as one should take it according to the location of the channels. According to the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; warm diseases also arise from four types of cold damage that manifest differently. </p>
<p>As Wang Shuhe states, when the yang pulse is floating and slippery, and the yin pulse is moist and weak, if it further encounters wind, it transforms into wind-heat. When the yang pulse is surging and rapid, and the yin pulse is solid and large, if it further encounters damp heat, it transforms into warm toxin; warm toxin is the most severe of diseases. When the yang pulse is moist and weak, and the yin pulse is tense and tight, if it further encounters dampness, it transforms into damp-heat. When both yin and yang pulses are robust but heavily affected by cold, it transforms into warm malaria. These cases exhibit the same diseases under different names and different pulses across various channels, which illustrates the idea of taking it according to the location of the channels. While Pang&#39;s view may not align with the &quot;Nan Jing,&quot; it still carries a similar meaning. However, the &quot;Shang Han Lun&quot; discusses warm epidemics without mentioning damp-heat, while Shuhe discusses damp-heat without mentioning warm epidemics; this is indeed a difference.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the case of cold damage, there are those who sweat and recover but die upon purging, and others who sweat and die but recover upon purging. What is the reason for this? Indeed. When Yang is deficient and Yin is excess, sweating leads to recovery; purging causes death. Conversely, when Yang is excess and Yin is deficient, sweating leads to death; purging results in recovery. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou said: When the disease is due to deficiency, it is considered weak; when the disease does not occur, it is seen as excess. It is precisely because of the deficiency that the evil enters; it is only due to excess that the evil cannot infiltrate. This refers to the idea in the &quot;External Treatise&quot; regarding exterior illnesses being harmonized with interior conditions, and interior illnesses being harmonized with exterior conditions, specifically concerning the changes in cold damage. When the exterior illness is harmonized with the interior, sweating can be appropriate, but when purging is done instead, the exterior evil remains, and the interior qi is compromised; when the interior illness is harmonized with the exterior, purging can be appropriate, but when sweating is attempted instead, the interior evil does not subside, and the exterior qi is compromised, resulting in death. Therefore, it is said that sweating can deplete Yang, while purging can harm Yin. The terms Yin and Yang are used here in relation to the exterior and interior.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Sixty-Ninth Difficulty discusses how to differentiate between mania and epilepsy. When mania first manifests, there is little sleep accompanied by a lack of hunger. It is characterized by a sense of superiority, discernment of wisdom, arrogance, excessive laughter, enjoyment of singing and music, and incessant wandering. When epilepsy first manifests, there is a lack of joy, rigidity, and a fixed stare, with the pulse showing strength in both yin and yang. </p>
<p>Huashou explains that mania arises from yang; thus, its symptoms are characterized by excess and activity. Epilepsy arises from yin, so its symptoms are characterized by deficiency and stillness. The pulse being strong in both yin and yang indicates that mania drives from yang, leading to a strong yang pulse. Conversely, if epilepsy arises from yin, it results in a strong yin pulse. In the twenty difficulties, the concepts of heavy yang correspond to mania, heavy yin to epilepsy, loss of yang to seeing spirits, and loss of yin to blindness; these should be associated with the discussions above. The term &quot;heavy&quot; should be pronounced like &quot;twice heavy.&quot; </p>
<p>Chen from Siming states that when qi is concentrated in yang, it results in heavy yang; when blood is concentrated in yin, it results in heavy yin. Loss of yang leads to seeing spirits, which indicates qi is not fixed; loss of yin leads to blindness, showing that blood does not nourish. The discussion of mania and epilepsy is detailed in the twenty-first chapter of the Nei Jing, but the Yue people specifically summarize it, likely inviting later generations to seek their own understanding.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a></p></div>

<p>If the pain is severe but localized in the heart, and the hands and feet appear bluish, it is called true heart pain. True heart pain can cause death by morning if it occurs in the evening, or by evening if it starts in the morning. Hua Shou further explained: &quot;The &#39;Lingshu&#39; states that true heart pain manifests with extreme pain in the heart and bluish coloration of the hands and feet down to the joints. The seventy-first chapter mentions that the lesser yin pertains to the heart vessels, and the heart is the supreme organ in the body. The heart serves as the ruler where the spirit resides; if the organ is robust, evil cannot intrude. If it does intrude, it harms the heart; when the heart is harmed, the spirit departs, and when the spirit departs, death ensues. &#39;True heart pain&#39; should have an omitted character before the word &#39;true&#39;, which indicates a textual omission. The &#39;bluish&#39; of the hands and feet should be understood as &#39;cold&#39;.&quot;</p>
<p>The sixty-first difficult question states: &quot;To know through observation is called spirit, to know through hearing is called sage, to know through inquiry is called skilled, and to know through pulse diagnosis is called clever; what does this mean? Indeed, knowing through observation means seeing the five colors to diagnose the illness.&quot; Hua Shou added: &quot;In the &#39;Suwen&#39;, the section on the generation of the five organs states that seeing colors: blue like lush grass indicates death, yellow like bitter orange indicates death, black like charcoal indicates death, red like fresh blood indicates death, and white like dry bones indicates death; these are the manifestations of death in the five colors. Blue like emerald indicates life, red like a rooster&#39;s comb indicates life, yellow like crab belly indicates life, white like pig fat indicates life, and black like crow feathers indicates life; these are the manifestations of life in the five colors.&quot;<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; Chapter 49, it states: black and blue indicate pain, yellow and red indicate heat, and white indicates cold. It also says if red appears on both cheekbones, the size of a thumb, though the sickness is minor, recovery will likely lead to sudden death; if black appears in the yard, the size of a thumb, it will lead to sudden death without illness. Furthermore, Chapter 74 states: when diagnosing blood vessels, much red and much heat indicate issues, much blue and much pain suggest problems, much black indicates chronic numbness, and the appearance of black, red, and blue together indicates cold, heat, and body ache.

Wang&#39;s Treatise on Pulse states: There are three divisions of pulse, namely, the cun (inch), chi (palm), and guan (bar). The flow of nourishing and guarding energy remains balanced. The kidney pulse is deep, the heart is surging, the lung is superficial, and the liver is taut. This adheres to the regular classics, without losing precision. Movements in rising and descending, the pulse revolving around itself. Water beneath a hundred beats, the pulse encircling the whole body.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The sixty-third difficulty states: Why are the ten transformations associated with the five organs and six bowels initiated with &quot;井&quot; (well)? Indeed. &quot;井&quot; represents the spring of the East, the beginning of all things. At this time, all creatures stir and breathe; every living thing is born with the spring. Therefore, the numbering of the years starts in spring, and the numbering of the days begins with &quot;甲&quot; (the first of the heavenly stems). Thus, “井” is regarded as the starting point.</p>
<p>【Hua Shou says: The twelve channels&#39; points are all called &quot;井&quot; (well), and, seeing that “井” is associated with the beginning of the &quot;荥&quot; (bladder meridian) and &quot;俞&quot; (source points), it&#39;s because &quot;井&quot; governs the Eastern wood, and wood symbolizes spring, the start of all things. The creatures moving are &quot;行&quot; (to walk), &quot;喘&quot; (to breathe), which means inhaling and exhaling. Gong Sun Hong&#39;s transmission states &quot;蚑行喙息,&quot; clarifying the meaning. “蜎” signifies flying, while “蠕” pertains to crawling, and both belong to the category of insects. All living things are engendered with spring; hence the counting of years begins with spring, and the counting of days commences with &quot;甲,&quot; making the “荥” convergence of humans start with &quot;井&quot; as well.】</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Yin and Yang are indeed different; what does this mean? It relates to the concepts of hardness and softness. Yin corresponds to the Wood of乙, while Yang corresponds to the Metal of庚. The Yang庚, being庚, represents the hardness of乙; while the Yin乙, being乙, represents the softness of庚.乙 signifies Wood, hence it is referred to as Yin井木;庚 signifies Metal, hence it is referred to as Yang井金. The others follow this pattern.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou states: Hardness and softness refer to the pairing of乙 and庚. The reason we speak of the ten stems in terms of乙 and庚 is that all vital organs and acupuncture points begin at井. The Yin meridian井 starts with乙木, and the Yang meridian井 starts with庚金, which is why we refer to the pairing of hardness and softness with乙庚, with the other five elements following suit.]</p>
<p>[Ding remarks: Hardness and softness refer to Yin井木 and Yang井金, where庚金 is hard and乙木 is soft; Yin荥火 and Yang荥水, where壬水 is hard and丁火 is soft; Yin俞土 and Yang俞木, where甲木 is hard and己土 is soft; Yin经金 and Yang经火, where丙火 is hard and辛金 is soft; Yin合水 and Yang合土, where戊土 is hard and癸水 is soft. The principle of the five elements reflects the mother-child relationship in generation, and the husband-wife relationship in overcoming and controlling. Therefore, the path of the husband is always hard, and the path of the wife is always soft; this is the natural order.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some say that the &quot;Lingshu&quot; identifies Tai Ling as the source of the heart, and the &quot;Nanjing&quot; agrees, but also distinguishes the Dui Gu as the source of the lesser yin. Various acupuncture texts treat Tai Ling as the acupuncture point for the hand jueyin heart master, while the Shen Men, located at the end of the Dui Gu on the palm&#39;s back, is understood as the point associated with the heart. What accounts for such differences?</p>
<p>According to the seventy-first chapter of the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; if the lesser yin has no outflow, does the heart not suffer? Qibo replies that while the exterior channels are ill, the organs are not ill, hence the focus on the channel at the back of the hand, at the Dui Gu. The other channels rise and fall, with variable speed, similar to the course of the hand lesser yin heart channel. Furthermore, the second chapter states that the heart emerges from Zhong Chong, flows through Lao Gong, reaches Tai Ling, travels through Jian Shi, and enters Qu Ze, coinciding with the hand lesser yin. It follows that points below Zhong Chong are part of the hand heart master channel, and the &quot;Lingshu&quot; explicitly identifies them as hand lesser yin, without separately listing the specific points of the hand lesser yin channel.</p>
<p>Moreover, the &quot;Suwen&quot; in the section on needle techniques states: needle the end of the hand heart master lesser yin at the Dui Gu, and then one achieves immediate results. In the section on Qi points, it indicates that the five organ points total fifty, with Wang&#39;s commentary noting only the heart protector channel&#39;s well point, without mentioning the heart channel&#39;s well point. Lastly, the seventy-ninth difficulty states: if the heart is ill, drain the hand heart master point, and tonify the hand heart master well point.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The twelve meridians are all based on the concept of &quot;yu&quot; (acupoints); why is that? Indeed. The &quot;yu&quot; of the five organs is where the three jiaos operate, where qi is retained and stopped. What is the basis for the &quot;yu&quot; that the three jiaos carry? Indeed. The moving qi between the kidneys below the navel is the essence of human life and the foundation of the twelve meridians; thus, it is called the &quot;yuan&quot; (origin). The three jiaos serve as the special envoy of the &quot;yuan&quot; qi, governing the circulation of the three types of qi, which traverse the five organs and six cavities. The &quot;yuan&quot; is the esteemed title of the three jiaos; therefore, wherever it stops, it is known as the &quot;yuan.&quot; In cases where the five organs and six cavities are diseased, all can be traced back to this &quot;yuan.&quot; </p>
<p>[Hua Shou comments: The twelve meridians all rely on &quot;yu&quot; as the foundation because the &quot;yu&quot; of each meridian is connected to the operations of the three jiaos, where qi is retained and stopped.

The three jiaos serve as the special envoy of the &quot;yuan&quot; qi, governing the circulation of the upper, middle, and lower types of qi, which travel through the five organs and six cavities. The circulation of the three types of qi can be understood as the essence of the true original qi from the lower jiao, known as &quot;yuan&quot; qi, which ascends to the middle jiao. The middle jiao receives the essence of water and grains, transforming it into nourishing and protective qi. This nourishing and protective qi communicates with the true original qi and reaches the upper jiao. Thus, &quot;yuan&quot; is the esteemed title of the three jiaos, and wherever it stops, it is referred to as the &quot;yuan,&quot; much like how the authorities are referred to in their official titles when they travel.

What does this mean? Indeed, the deficient is supplemented by its mother, while the excess is drained from its child. One should first supplement and then drain.

For instance, if there is a deficiency in the liver, one should supplement the Jueyin channel; this would be Ququan. If excessive, one should drain the Jueyin channel; this would be Xingjian. One should first supplement and then drain. This refers to conditions of Yang qi being insufficient and Yin qi being excessive; one should first supplement the Yang before draining the Yin. However, this meaning does not belong here; it is either a mistake or a misinterpretation.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In spring and summer, the attainment of one yin is essential; similarly, in autumn and winter, the attainment of one yang is necessary. What does this mean? Indeed, in spring and summer, the warmth must lead to one yin; this is achieved by initially needling deeply until reaching the kidney and liver regions to collect and hold the yin energy.

<p>[Hua Shou commented: In spring and summer, the warm energy necessarily leads to one yin, which means nurturing yang during these seasons. When needles are first inserted deeply to the kidney and liver regions, one awaits the gathering of energy before withdrawing and lifting the needle to the heart and lung regions, which is referred to as attaining one yin. In autumn and winter, the cold energy naturally leads to one yang, which signifies nurturing yin during these times. Initially, the needle is inserted shallow and superficially at the heart and lung areas, awaiting the collection of energy before pushing the needle further in to reach the kidney and liver regions, hence achieving one yang. This commentary on yin and yang reflects a principle particularly emphasized by the practitioners from the regions beyond. In all acupuncture practices, there are appropriate methods for reinforcement or depletion, and one does not need to be overly bound by these guidelines.]<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a></p></div>

<p>Why are the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys connected to spring, summer, autumn, and winter? Indeed, when one of the five organs is ill, it manifests in five colors.

Indeed. Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth should balance each other. The East represents wood, and the West represents gold. Wood desires to be substantial; gold should balance it. Fire desires to be substantial; water should balance it. Earth desires to be substantial; wood should balance it. Gold desires to be substantial; fire should balance it. Water desires to be substantial; earth should balance it. The East corresponds to the liver, so we know the liver is substantial; the West corresponds to the lungs, so we know the lungs are empty.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text states: When one organ is excessive, it should be balanced by the opposing one. The east corresponds to the liver, the west to the lungs; if the liver is excessive, it is known that the lungs are deficient. If the lungs are not deficient, how could the liver be excessively full? Whether to drain or to supplement, one must temper the excess and remedy the deficiency; this is the way to correct extremes. Water can overcome fire; the son can make the mother full, and the mother can make the son deficient. To drain the southern fire is to take away the energy of the child, allowing the mother to have more; to supplement the northern water is to increase the energy of the child so that it does not rely on the mother. In this way, the excess retreats and the deficiency progresses, allowing metal to balance wood, thus preventing the east and west from experiencing skewed advantages or disadvantages. The view of the Yue people generally suggests that the east is overly full while the west is lacking; hence, fire is drained to suppress wood and water is supplemented to support metal, allowing metal to achieve balance with wood. If one were to desire metal not to balance wood, the preceding and following text would contradict each other and the argument would be incoherent. If the liver&#39;s wood is not excessive and the lungs are not deficient, then to drain fire and supplement water is nearly to mix fullness and deficiency. The discussions of the eighty-one difficulties align with this concept. The Cai family of Jiufeng states that water, fire, metal, wood, and earth should mutually control each other to drain excess; their intent is likewise the same.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, the concluding statement reads: if one cannot govern the emptiness, why ask about the rest? This serves as a warning for those who understand the constant yet not the variable. The main idea of this text is about the liver being solid and the lungs being weak, focusing on draining fire and supplementing water.</p>
<p>Someone might ask: if the son can solidify the mother, and the mother can weaken the son, should we then drain fire and supplement earth? The reasoning is that when the son is abundant, he does not draw from the mother&#39;s energy, while if the mother is insufficient, she cannot nourish her son. By draining the southern fire, one deprives the son of energy, allowing the mother to be more abundant; by supplementing the central earth, one enhances the mother’s energy, ensuring her ability to nurture her son. Now, why drain fire and supplement water? It is said: this is the brilliance of the Yue people, achieving two benefits with one action. </p>
<p>Moreover, draining fire serves to seize the energy of wood and to eliminate the dominance of metal; supplementing water assists in nourishing the energy of metal while controlling the brilliance of fire. If we were to supplement earth, it would solely aid metal and cannot serve dual purposes, which is why we supplement water instead of earth. </p>
<p>Another question may arise: can the mother not make the son solid, and the son make the mother weak, according to the principles of the five elements? Yet, the Yue people assert that the son can solidify the mother and the mother can weaken the son. Why is this?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The mother can make the child substantial, and the child can make the mother empty; this is the generation and transformation of the Five Elements. If the child can make the mother substantial, and the mother can make the child empty, this refers to the gain and loss in the practice of acupuncture, and they are indeed not the same. The Chen family of Siming states: Zhang Zhongjing says: &quot;Wood overcomes Metal,&quot; which is called &quot;Horizontal.&quot; The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: &quot;When Qi is excessive, it controls what it triumphs over, and insults what it cannot overcome.&quot; When Wood is substantial and Metal is empty, it implies Wood is horizontal and overcomes Metal, thus it insults what cannot be overcome. Wood is originally balanced by Metal, but due to its strong Qi, it becomes horizontal. If Metal balances it, they do not suppress each other and combat ensues; in battle, both the substantial and the empty suffer losses. Metal, being empty, relies on Qi from Earth; however, at that moment Earth is also constrained and cannot sufficiently support it. Thus, Water is seen as the child of Metal and the mother of Wood; hence, it drains Fire and supplements Water, allowing Water to overcome Fire. Consequently, Fire weakens and draws Qi from Wood, thus Wood diminishes and does not become substantial again. Water, as the mother of Wood, can indeed make the child empty. Once Wood is not substantial, its Qi is balanced; when balanced, Metal avoids being overrun by Wood and does not become empty again. Water, being the child of Metal, can indeed make the mother substantial. The saying that Metal cannot balance Wood, and cannot directly use Metal to balance Wood, must drain Fire and supplement Water, treating it indirectly, so that the Qi of Wood and Metal naturally balances each other. According to Chen&#39;s statement, there is logic in it; however, for the one word &quot;not,&quot; it is entangled and overly strained, not as direct as simply using &quot;not&quot; as an extension of the text. In recognizing the 81 chapters, one can see the phrase &quot;Metal balances Wood&quot; clearly.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The seventy-sixth difficulty asks: What is meant by tonification and depletion? When tonifying, what energy is to be taken? When depleting, what energy is to be placed? Indeed, when tonifying, one takes energy from the protective aspect; when depleting, one places energy in the nourishing aspect. If there is a deficiency of yang energy and an excess of yin energy, one should first tonify the yang and then deplete the yin; if there is a deficiency of yin energy and an excess of yang energy, one should first tonify the yin and then deplete the yang. The communication between the nourishing and protective aspects is essential.</p>
<p>[Hua Shou commented: &quot;In the &#39;Lingshu&#39; chapter fifty-two, it states that the floating energy not following the meridians is what is referred to as protective energy, while the essence energy that circulates through the meridians is the nourishing energy. Thus, for tonification, one takes the floating energy not following the meridians to replenish areas of deficiency; for depletion, energy is placed from the nourishing aspect without use. &#39;Place&#39; here means to abandon or set aside. However, a person&#39;s illness does not uniformly manifest, and the methods of tonification and depletion are not singular either. Therefore, if there is a deficiency of yang energy while yin energy is in excess, first tonify the yang and then deplete the yin to harmonize; if there is a deficiency of yin energy while yang energy is in excess, first tonify the yin and then deplete the yang to harmonize. In this way, the communication between the nourishing and protective aspects will naturally occur.

The &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; chapter fifty-five, states: The superior physician needles what has not yet developed; next, one needles what has not yet become severe; then, one needles what has already weakened. The inferior physician needles what is currently active, or what appears to be at its peak, or what has a disease that opposes the pulse. Therefore, one should avoid injuring when the condition is strong; needling a weakened condition requires careful effort. Hence, it is said that the superior physician treats the disease before it manifests, not the already manifested disease; this is what it refers to.]<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The seventy-eighth difficulty states: &quot;There is a distinction between tonifying and draining, what does this mean?&quot; Indeed. The methods of tonification and draining do not necessarily require the expulsion of the internal needle during breathing. Those who understand needles trust their left, while those who do not trust their right. When needling, first use the left hand to press and hold down on the area being needled. Then flick and nudge it, grasping and directing the energy as if mimicking the shape of an artery, inserting the needle in the same direction. If you obtain the energy, push it inward, which is called tonification; if you cause it to move and extend, that is called draining. Failing to obtain the energy equates to an irretrievable condition akin to a man outside and a woman inside. Failing to obtain energy is known as &quot;ten deaths with no remedy.&quot; [Note: &quot;Nudge&quot; is pronounced like &quot;anger.&quot;] [Huashou commented: To flick and nudge is to encourage the energy; grasping and directing it slightly heavier is intended to guide the energy to reach. When the energy arrives below the fingers, resembling the shape of an artery, one then takes action to needle it. &quot;Following&quot; corresponds to &quot;bearing,&quot; while &quot;taking advantage&quot; refers to &quot;seizing.&quot; Stopping the needle to wait for energy means waiting until the energy arrives and causes the needle to move, which indicates obtaining the energy.]<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To push the needle inward is called &quot;tonification.&quot; To move the needle and extend it outward is called &quot;sedation.&quot; This is the heart technique of the Yue people, not the respiratory method from the inside out. This is indeed the case. If the needle is held still while waiting for qi, and it does not arrive for a long time, then with a man, the needle should be inserted more superficially to feel for the wei qi. With a woman, it should be inserted more deeply to feel for the rong qi. If, after this, qi is still not obtained, it is said that the illness is ultimately untreatable. The text uses the term &quot;qi&quot; differently in its earlier and later sections; this must not be confused. The earlier mention of qi coming resembles the state of an artery, and refers to the qi felt by the left hand before needling. The later mention of obtaining or not obtaining qi pertains to what is felt under the needle itself; these are two separate sections. Zhou Zhongli said: In all cases of feeling for qi, the left hand should apply slight pressure. If qi cannot be felt, then with a man, lighten the touch on the wei qi to feel it; with a woman, apply more pressure on the rong qi to feel it. Thus, if there is no distinction between before and after, and the method of waiting for qi with the needle is misunderstood, what basis is there for differentiating between tonification and sedation?<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Hua Shou states: &quot;Welcoming and seizing&quot; indicates draining, while &quot;following and assisting&quot; indicates replenishing. In the case of heart disease, the heart represents fire. The earth is the offspring of fire, with the hand’s heart region being the location Tai Ling.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Eighty Difficulties state: The scriptures mention &quot;having a perception like entering&quot; and &quot;having a perception like exiting,&quot; what does this mean? Indeed. &quot;Having a perception like entering&quot; refers to the left hand feeling the qi arriving, then inserting the needle; when the needle enters, and the qi is felt to be exhausted, then the needle is withdrawn. This is called &quot;having a perception like entering&quot; and &quot;having a perception like exiting.&quot; </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The phrase &quot;having a perception like entering&quot; should be accompanied by &quot;having a perception like exiting.&quot; For example, read &quot;ruo&quot; (如) in a similar manner as &quot;yue&quot; (月). In Mengzi, it is written that one observes the Dao but does not yet see it, thus &quot;ruo&quot; can be used interchangeably.

<p>The Eighty-First Difficulties state: The scriptures mention &quot;no substance, substance, void, and emptiness, reducing what is insufficient while increasing what is excessive,&quot; does this refer to the cun (寸) pulse? Does a condition inherently have void and substance? How are reduction and increase related? Indeed. This condition does not refer solely to the cun pulse but indicates that the condition itself has void and substance. For instance, if the liver is full and the lungs are deficient, the liver corresponds to wood and the lungs to metal, which must balance each other; one should realize that metal must stabilize wood. Conversely, if the lungs are full and the liver is slightly deficient in qi, one should not tonify the liver but rather reduce excess in the lungs. Hence it is said, &quot;substance, substance; void, void; reduce what is insufficient while increasing what is excessive.&quot; This represents harm done by those of intermediate skill. </p>
<p>[Hua Shou says: The two characters for &quot;this condition&quot; should be disregarded as errors or additions. If the liver is full and the lungs are deficient, metal should stabilize wood, as explained in the Seventy-Fifth Difficulty. If the lungs are full and the liver is deficient, then metal should be subdued while supporting wood.]<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a></p></div>

A boy's journey goes left for ten months, culminating in Yin and birth; a girl's journey goes right for ten months, culminating in Shen and birth. Thus, according to destiny scholars, a boy begins at the first year with Bing Yin, and a girl begins at the first year with Ren Shen. The 'Nan Jing' does not mention the beginning, but rather states that being born equates to already being one year old. Ren and Bing are the two heavenly stems representing Water and Fire, the parents of all things; Yin and Shen are the two earthly branches representing Metal and Wood, marking the beginning and end of the natural order. Wood is abundant in Shen, and Metal is abundant in Yin; these two energies correspond well, thus both Yin and Shen are utilized. Metal emerges in Si, which is paired with Shen, hence girls involve Shen; Wood emerges in Hai, which is paired with Yin, hence boys involve Yin. Therefore, when a boy is ten years old, he follows the path through Hai; when a girl is seven years old, she also moves towards Hai in the reverse direction. A boy at sixteen experiences Tian Gui in Si, progressing left to engage the vital energy of Si; a girl at fourteen experiences Tian Gui also in Si, aligned in the same palace of vital energy as the boy. The matching of Yin and Yang thus establishes the path of husband and wife, which is why there are male and female.

The channels of the hands are: Taiyin of the Lung, Yangming of the Large Intestine, Shaoyin of the Heart, Taiyang of the Small Intestine, Jueyin of the Pericardium, and Shaoyang of the Triple Burner. The channels of the feet are: Taiyin of the Spleen, Yangming of the Stomach, Shaoyin of the Kidney, Taiyang of the Bladder, Jueyin of the Liver, and Shaoyang of the Gallbladder.

[Huashou explains: The main purpose of this passage will be elaborated in the following text. The inch pulse is the pulse of qi. Residing at the fish border of the Hand Taiyin, it is measured by a division of one inch. Below the qi pulse are the points called Guan and Chi, which are all places traversed by the Hand Taiyin, and the Hand Taiyin is the origin of the flow of the hundred pulses as they converge. As for the five viscera, there is a separate discussion; the sovereign asks: why does the qi pulse exclusively govern the five viscera? Qibo replies: the stomach is the sea of water and grain, and the major source of the six intestines. The five flavors enter through the mouth, are stored in the stomach, nourish the qi of the five viscera, and manifest at the qi pulse. The first chapter of the \"Lingshu\" states: the pulse converges at Taiyuan. The Jade Tablet discourse states: the method of regulating the extraordinary and the consistent begins with Taiyin. It is emphasized that first, with the qi pulse of the Hand Taiyin, the standard qi of the four seasons should be established, and then the extraordinary and consistent qi measured. The separate discussion of the meridians says: the lung governs the hundred pulses; it also states that the qi pulse forms the inch, which decides life and death. Observing in conjunction with numerical theories, it is evident that the inch pulse corresponds to the Hand Taiyin and thus represents the great meeting point of the pulses. This reflects the inquiry of the Yue people, which is why the inch pulse is uniquely emphasized, establishing it as a reliable method for future generations.

The flow of nourishment and defense moves twenty-five degrees in yang and twenty-five degrees in yin, completing one cycle. Therefore, the fifty degrees converge at the inch pulse of the hand Taiyin, which is where the internal organs begin and end, thus the method is taken from the inch pulse. [Hua Shou said: Referring to the above, this concerns a healthy person without illness who has regular breath counts. Exhalation relates to the output of qi, which is yang; inhalation relates to the intake of qi, which is yin. According to the Huainanjing's theory on healthy qi: with each exhalation, the pulse moves again, and with each inhalation, the pulse moves again, and when breathing settles, the pulse moves five times. Adding the great breath, this is termed a healthy person. Thus, when a healthy person exhales, the pulse moves three inches; when they inhale, the pulse moves three inches, and with settled breathing, the pulse moves six inches. Considering the number of breaths, there are a total of 13,500 breaths in one day and night; considering the movement of the pulse, it travels fifty degrees around the body. The flow of nourishment and defense in yang is twenty-five degrees, and in yin, also twenty-five degrees.

Counting the breaths as two hundred seventy per cycle, the pulse travels sixteen zhang and two chi, while two moments constitute one full body cycle. This process returns to the hand Taiyin, accumulating and filling it. A person’s inhalation and exhalation count as one breath; there are one hundred thirty-five breaths per moment, eight moments per hour yielding one thousand eighty breaths, and twelve hours plus ninety-six moments totals twelve thousand nine hundred sixty breaths. Dividing the excess results in five hundred forty breaths, combining to form thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. One breath corresponds to a six-inch pulse movement, with two moments equating to two hundred seventy breaths, which again covers the journey of sixteen zhang and two chi per hour. This means that during eight moments, the pulse moves sixty-four zhang and eight chi, nourishing and protecting the body all around. In twelve hours, accounting for ninety-six moments, the pulse travels seven hundred seventy-seven zhang and six chi, resulting in forty-eight full body cycles. Dividing the excess results in two extra body cycles, totaling thirty-two zhang and four chi. Overall, this is fifty full body measurements with the pulse reaching eight hundred ten zhang.

Indeed, the dimensions refer to the major significance of the pulse. [Hua Shou says: \"According to the 'Shuo Wen,' the 'chi' (尺) is a unit of measure equal to ten 'cun' (寸). In the human hand, the pulse is measured at a ten-fold radius as 'cun,' where ten cun make up one chi; this is a regulation measurement. In ancient times, units like chi, cun, zhi, xun, chang, and ren were all based on the human body, thus the characters combine the body and a single unit, representing the shape of fingers. 'Cun' means ten parts. In the human hand, the pulse at one cun is referred to as 'cun kou,' and as noted in the 'Shuo Wen,' it illustrates the dimensions of the pulse within the human body. The chi represents the yin division while the cun represents the yang division. Every meridian, organ, and bodily system operates by yin and yang, whether excessive or deficient, reflected in their measurements, thus underscoring the major significance of the pulse. One might say that 'cun kou' is of great importance to the pulse, as it pertains to the lungs in relation to all pulses. This refers to dimensions as being of substantial significance concerning the interaction of yin and yang. Generally speaking, the meridian of the Taiyin travels from the middle jiao and extends all the way to the tip of both thumbs. The area near the fish joints stretches a length of one cun and nine fen, commonly referred to as 'cun kou.'

This internal barrier means that Yin is closed within and unable to ascend, while Yang enters from the outside to obstruct it; this is the pulse of Yang occupying the Yin position.] Thus, it is said: overturning and overflowing.

This text discusses the extremes of yin and yang; although it denotes a diseased pulse, it does not yet signal imminent danger. If one were to proceed with excessive input and engage in overflow, then it becomes a dead pulse. The character 'sui' (to proceed) is particularly crucial, as it connects the preceding and following essential points. Otherwise, the extremes of yin and yang, the interaction and overflow, become a single concept, with no distinctions or priorities. Some might question the differences in the discussion of yin and yang between this text and the twenty chapters. It is said that this chapter represents the ultimate manifestation of yin and yang interacting as overflow, whereas the twenty chapters depict the further interaction of yin and yang in a concealed manner. The character 'geng' (to change) is distinctly different from 'sui'; 'geng' indicates mutual interaction, while 'sui' suggests direct progression. Moreover, overflow and concealment cannot be conflated, as overflow signifies a dead pulse, while concealment indicates a diseased pulse, hence they should not be discussed together.

The spleen is the center of the body, therefore its pulse is found in the middle, reflecting the principle of yin and yang. Hua Shou said: the heart and lungs are floating yet distinct; the heart is the supreme yang, hence its pulse is floating and widely spread; the lungs are the yin within yang, thus its pulse is floating and short. The kidneys and liver are sinking yet distinct; the liver is the yang within yin, so its pulse is firm and long; the kidneys are the yin within yin, leading to a moist pulse that feels solid when lifted. The ancient scholar Yuan noted that the kidneys belong to the water pulse, showing exterior softness yet inner firmness, embodying the essence of water. The explanation of the spleen is as mentioned earlier. Pulses may have one yin and one yang, one yin and two yang, or one yin and three yang; conversely, there may be one yang and one yin, one yang and two yin, or one yang and three yin.

Hua Shou said: The inquiry and answers clarify that the yin and yang pulses observed in the three regions are not simply singular.

The liver is below the spleen, governing the tendons; therefore, its pulse is like the weight of twelve beans.

Now, when we apply this method to express weight, it would correspond to the notion of floating and sinking. However, there is no mention of this in the “Pivot” or “Essence” texts. Is it passed down from the ancient pulse methods or is it an insight gained by the Yue people themselves? The Xie family of Luling states: In the measurements of the cun (寸) and ge (尺) pulse positions, each organ has its specific loci, and within each section, the pulse itself also has variation in weight. For instance, as the Yushi of Lingyang pointed out: If the left wrist's cun feels like the weight of three beans, that indicates the influx of lung qi; if it feels like six beans, it indicates the flow of the fundamental meridian, and one should similarly infer for the rest. Thus, one understands that the energies of the five organs interpenetrate each other, and the six pulses consequently provide a standard, which can determine auspiciousness or illness. The same applies to other pulse positions, like the examples of the ten difficulties and their variations. The sixth difficulty states: The pulse may present with an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang or an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. What does this mean? Indeed, when the floating pulse is diminished, it indicates lightness; when the sinking pulse is solid, it indicates heaviness, thus illustrating an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; conversely, when the sinking pulse is diminished and the floating pulse is solid, this indicates an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. This is the essence of the concepts of yin, yang, deficiency, and fullness. Hua Shou remarks: The terms floating and sinking refer to weight, while excess and deficiency are described in terms of yin and yang balancing. A light touch reveals less, while a heavy touch shows more, indicating an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; conversely, a heavy touch reveals less, while a light touch shows more, indicating an excess of yang and a deficiency of yin. Generally, a light touch reveals the yang aspect, while a heavy touch reveals the yin aspect, regardless of the specific location; this principle serves as the basis for further deductions."},{"anchor":"trans-20p","marker":"20p","type":"translation","text":"The Seven Difficulties states: The Classic mentions the arrival of lesser yang as sometimes large and sometimes small, sometimes short and sometimes long; the arrival of yang brightness as floating and large yet short; the arrival of greater yang as vast and long; the arrival of greater yin as tight and long; the arrival of lesser yin as tight, fine, and subtle; and the arrival of ultimate yin as heavy, short, and solid.

Ji's commentary also states that from the day of the winter solstice, the first yang is born. Thus, the first cycle after the winter solstice represents the true king of lesser yang. If we trace its origin, based on the common practices of combining the first cycle with the winter solstice, then the king of lesser yang should indeed begin from this day, continuing through the middle of the first month, followed by the other phases in succession. When lesser yang arrives, the yang energy is still weak, which is why its pulse fluctuates in size—it varies between being large and small, and between being short and long.

Indeed, the rapid pulse indicates the bowels, while the slow pulse indicates the viscera. A rapid pulse suggests heat, whereas a slow pulse suggests cold. All yang-related conditions indicate heat, and all yin-related conditions indicate cold. Thus, we can differentiate the diseases of the viscera and bowels. 【Hua Shou said: In general, for a person's pulse, one inhalation and one exhalation constitute one breath. Within one breath, the pulse beats four times; if extended, it beats five times, and this is called the pulse of a healthy person. A healthy person has a stable pulse; any increase or decrease indicates illness. Therefore, if there are three beats in one breath, it is called slow, indicative of an insufficient pulse; if there are six beats, it is called rapid, indicative of an excessive pulse. The viscera are yin, and the bowels are yang. A rapid pulse is associated with the bowels, indicating yang and heat; a slow pulse is associated with the viscera, indicating yin and cold. This principle applies not just to these cases, as all yang pulses signify heat and all yin pulses signify cold. The diseases of the viscera and bowels are differentiated based on these principles.】"},{"anchor":"trans-26p","marker":"26p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Ten Difficulties\" states: What does it mean that a single pulse manifests as ten variations? It is so. The five evils represent the interplay of hardness and softness. For example, if the heart pulse is very rapid, it suggests that liver evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly rapid, it indicates that gallbladder evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is very strong, it means heart evil is affecting the heart itself; if the heart pulse is slightly strong, it implies that small intestine evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is extremely slow, it suggests spleen evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly slow, it indicates that stomach evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is very thin, it suggests lung evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly thin, it means large intestine evil is affecting the small intestine. If the heart pulse is very deep, it indicates kidney evil is affecting the heart; if the heart pulse is slightly deep, it suggests bladder evil is affecting the small intestine. Each of the five organs has its corresponding hardness and softness evils, thus a single pulse can seemingly transform into ten variations. [Hua Shou says: The five evils refer to the qi of the five organs and five bowels that have deviated from their proper state and become evil. Hardness and softness denote yang as hardness and yin as softness. The interplay of hardness and softness means that organs intersect with organs, and bowels intersect with bowels. Each of the five organs and five bowels has five evils; thus, for those pulses that are very strong, they belong to the organs, while those that are weak belong to the bowels.

Now, if the inhalation cannot reach the kidneys and only reaches the liver before returning, it is known that the organ lacking energy is the kidneys, as their energy is depleted first. [Hua Shou said: In the fifth chapter of \"The Spirit Pivot,\" it is mentioned that a person takes in energy fifty times a day and night to nourish the essence of the five organs. If this number is not achieved, it is called a mad living. The so-called fifty times means that each of the five organs receives energy, and one counts their pulse at each intake. If there are fifty beats without a replacement, it means all five organs receive energy; if there are forty beats with one replacement, one organ lacks energy; if there are thirty beats with one replacement, two organs lack energy; if there are twenty beats with one replacement, three organs lack energy; if there are ten beats with one replacement, four organs lack energy; and if there are fewer than ten beats with one replacement, all five organs lack energy, leading to a short lifespan. The kidneys are located at the lowest point among the five organs, and inhalation is the furthest; thus, if there are fifty beats but one stops, it indicates that the kidneys lack support, and their energy should be depleted first.

How can one distinguish between the severing of inside and outside? Indeed, when the pulses of the five organs are severed internally, the qi of the kidneys and liver has also been severed within, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the heart and lungs; when the pulses of the five organs are severed externally, the pulses of the heart and lungs have also been severed outside, yet the physician mistakenly supplements the kidneys and liver. Supplementing yang for the deficiency of yin and supplementing yin for the deficiency of yang is what is called truly supporting and truly depleting, diminishing the insufficient and augmenting the abundant. In such cases, the dead person is killed by the physician. Hua Shou states: In the first chapter of the \"Lingshu,\" it is said that before using needles, one must first diagnose the pulses and observe the severity of the condition to treat it appropriately. In the third chapter, it states that when the qi of the five organs is severed internally, the pulse's qi cannot reach inward, yet one takes the external area of disease, connecting to the yang vessels, leaving needles to draw forth yang qi; when the yang qi arrives, the internal heavy supply is depleted, and when depleted, death occurs, for there is no qi to move, hence it lies still. When the qi of the five organs is severed externally, the pulse's qi cannot reach outward, yet one takes the channels of the four extremities, leaving needles to draw forth yin qi; when the yin qi arrives, the yang qi reverses and enters, and upon entering, this reversal leads to death, for the excess of yin qi results in agitation. This distinction of pulses, internal and external, speaks to yin and yang. The people of Yue differentiate inside and outside of heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver to explain yin and yang by this principle.

[Hua Shou says: In the fourth chapter of \"Lingshu,\" it states that to see the color and understand the illness is called 'ming'; to feel the pulse and know the illness is called 'shen'; to inquire about the illness and know the location is called 'gong.' The color, pulse, shape, and flesh should not be divorced from each other. If the color is blue, the pulse should be taut; if red, the pulse should be hooked; if yellow, the pulse should be regular; if white, the pulse should be short; and if black, the pulse should be heavy.

If one finds an antagonistic pulse, that means death; if one finds a supportive pulse, the illness will cease. 'Cease' means to heal or to combine.] Indeed, the five organs have five colors, all visible on the face, and they should correspond with what is felt at the wrist and within the body. For instance, if the color is blue, the pulse should be taut and rapid; if red, the pulse should be floating, large, and scattered; if yellow, the pulse should be moderate and large; if white, the pulse should be floating, weak, and short; if black, the pulse should be heavy and slippery.

The liver and gallbladder combine to form the clean and clear organ, hence good cleanliness. The liver is the general's organ, hence the propensity for anger. Happiness is akin to goodness and fondness. A bluish face reflects the color of the liver; these are favorable signs of color and pulse. The left side of the abdomen pertains to the liver; if firm upon pressing, it indicates the movement and firmness of qi, possibly causing pain. Feng noted: If liver qi (Yue Zhen) is constrained, there will be fullness in the limbs. The \"Zuo Zhuan\" states that wind will bring about latent illness. The jueyin pulse circulates along the yin organs, hence liver illness leads to difficulty in urination and defecation. Muscle cramps arise as the liver governs the sinews.

The Seventeenth Difficulty states: The classics mention that illnesses may lead to death, or may not be treated yet heal on their own, or may persist for years without resolution. Can the matter of life and death be discerned by pulse-taking? Yes, it can be fully understood. Diagnosis of an illness, if one closes their eyes and does not wish to see others, should reflect the liver pulse—strong, urgent, and long; if instead, one feels the lung pulse—floating, short, and thin—it indicates death.

The hand Taiyin (Yin Metal) corresponds to the Yangming (Metal), while the foot Shaoyin (Yin Water) corresponds to the Taiyang (Water).

The foot Jueyin (Yin Wood) corresponds to the Shaoyang (Yang Wood), which produces the hand Taiyang (Yang Fire) and Shaoyin (Yin Fire). Fire rises upward and cannot descend, thus it represents the upper part. The hand Xin (Heart) governs the Shaoyang (Yang Fire) and produces the foot Taiyin (Yin Earth) and Yangming (Earth), where Earth governs the central part. All of these signify the reciprocal generation and nurturing of the Five Elements. [Hua Shou remarks: The hand Taiyin (Yin Metal) and foot Taiyang (Yin Water) are in the lower part because Water is inherently downward flowing. The foot Shaoyin (Yin Water) generates the foot Jueyin (Yin Wood), which in turn generates the hand Shaoyin (Yin Fire) and which governs the fire from the hand Xin. Fire ascends and thus represents the upper part. Fire generates the foot Taiyin (Yin Earth), which resides in the central part and further produces the Lung Metal. This dynamic illustrates the reciprocal generation and nurturing of the Five Elements. This can be interpreted as confirming the structure of the upper and lower parts according to the generative properties of the organs rather than waiting for a predetermined order of generation. Furthermore, there is an elaboration into a tripartite framework, referring to the four difficulties discussed: heart and lung being elevated, kidney and liver being lower, while the spleen symbolizes the central region.

[Xie states: This section should be viewed as a response in the \"Sixteen Difficulties.” The simplified characters are misplaced here, omitting the context of the three divisions and nine qualities. The phrase about careful examination and needling emphasizes the need to assess the pulse's movement and the underlying illness; hence, it is mentioned as careful examination and needling.

If, for instance, the pulse is both stagnant and hidden, it indicates there is no internal accumulation; if the pulse is floating and stagnant, it indicates there is no external stubborn disease. If there is accumulation, the pulse will not be stagnated or hidden; if there is a stubborn disease, the pulse will not be floating or stagnant. This is a case where the pulse does not correspond to the disease, and the disease does not correspond to the pulse, which is classified as a terminal condition. The nineteenth difficulty states: the classics mention that the pulse can be reversed or aligned. What does this mean? The term \"aligned\" refers to constancy. The pulse can indeed be reversed or aligned, comparing the two genders. The male pulse is typically upper at the barometric level, while the female pulse is generally lower. A male's pulse at the wrist is usually weak, whereas a female's pulse at the wrist is often strong; this is the distinction between their pulses. Reversal refers to the opposite of their norm.

Thus, the male pulse is consistently weak at the wrist, whereas the female pulse is consistently strong; this is their nature.

When the pulse is in the yang area and the yin pulse appears, it indicates yin surmounting yang; even if the pulse occasionally feels superficial and slippery, this refers to yin hidden within yang. As indicated, 'within' means it is present and should be so. The yin pulse is measured at the cun (inch), while the yang pulse is measured at the chi (foot). The term 'surmount' is akin to riding atop a vehicle. The term 'hidden' relates to the concealment of soldiers. 'To hide' means to store away.

If qi is stagnant and does not circulate, it indicates an initial disease of qi; if blood is obstructed and does not nourish, it indicates a subsequent disease of blood. Therefore, the movement occurs first, followed by the disease. [Hua Shou comments: \"Respiration\" refers to warmth; qi governs respiration, which means a person's true qi flows in and out, warming and evaporating between the skin and flesh. Blood governs nourishment, referring to the way a person's blood vessels moisten the muscles and bones, lubricating the joints and nourishing the organs. This term 'meridian' does not refer to mere dimensions but rather to the pathways of the twelve meridians. It is stated that within each meridian, there are indeed two diseases because they are differentiated by the presences of qi and blood. If the pathogen is in qi, then qi causes the movement; if it is in blood, then blood produces the disease. Stagnation of qi indicates a disease of qi, while stagnation of blood demonstrates a blood disease; thus, the movement occurs first and the disease arises afterward. The sequence implies that qi is external and blood is internal; when the exterior first encounters the pathogen, does the interior also follow suit and become ill?

The heart rules the hand Jueyin, and its channel begins in the chest and ends at the tip of the little finger. In contrast, the hand Shaoyin begins in the heart and ends at the inner side of the little finger. Therefore, the hand Shaoyin and the heart each represent a distinct channel.

The thirty-six difficult questions mention that the energy of the gate of life connects with the kidneys, suggesting it is not separate from the kidneys. Is this not referred to as the \"trigram of water\"? The heart center represents a position of fire, while the gate of life expresses a shared energy of water.

The organs of a person have both Yin and Yang, and are respectively paired; how could there be a theory of one channel pairing with two? The notion that it connects with the Heart Master above truly implies a relationship of exterior and interior; the connection with the Right Kidney below refers to the San Jiao as the distinct envoy of Original Qi. Understanding this clarifies that the Life Gate connects with the Kidney and that there cannot be dual pairing for the San Jiao. Hence, the various claims can be discerned and made clear without confusion. Regarding pulse diagnosis, the Hand Jueyin (Liver) Fire resides at the right wrist, and the San Jiao is the same. Since the Life Gate connects with the Kidney, it should be at the left wrist. Yet, Xie states in the \"Pulse Classic\" that the Hand Jueyin is at the same location as the Hand Shaoyin (Heart) pulse; the San Jiao pulse appears at the inch, is evident in the pass, and links with the Kidney at the lower Jiao.

The spirit is the transformation of essence; when two essences are thin together, it is called spirit. The spleen governs thinking, thus storing intention and wisdom.

Why is this so? Indeed. The classics state that the heart nourishes the lungs and circulates yang energy; hence, it is positioned above. The large and small intestines transmit yin energy and are positioned below; thus they are distanced from each other. [Huashou said: The heart nourishes the lungs, circulates yang energy, and resides above; the large and small intestines transmit yin energy and reside below, hence the necessity of their distance.] Furthermore, all the viscera are yang; being places of purity, why are the large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and bladder all subject to impurity?

Thus, it is known that the kidneys have one aspect. [Hua Shou commented: The kidneys have two aspects, with the left being the kidney and the right being the Mingmen. Men store essence here and receive the essences of the five organs and six bowels; women connect to the womb here, allowing them to receive essence and facilitate transformation.

The liver’s energy connects to the eyes; when the eyes are harmonious, one can discern black and white.

If the pathogen resides in the five organs, then the yin channels are not harmonious; when the yin channels are not harmonious, blood becomes stagnant, and if blood is stagnant, the yin channels become excessive. When yin energy is too excessive, yang energy cannot thrive, hence it is said to be inhibited. When yang energy is too excessive, yin energy cannot thrive, hence it is said to be obstructed. When both yin and yang are excessive, they cannot interact, thus it is termed as blocked obstruction. Blocked obstruction means one cannot fully live out their life and may die. This closely resembles the text from the \"Spiritual Pivot,\" Chapter Seventeen. It is sometimes said that when the pathogen accumulates, it causes swelling and heat, and one should use acupuncture to dispel it, which should be seen as a conclusion to this chapter. Indeed, when the energies of yin and yang are excessively strong, it leads to blocked obstruction, which is fatal.

It ends and begins again, unspilling and overflowing. The qi within a person remains warm in the organs and moist externally in the skin.

The gate of life is where the spirit resides; in men, it stores essence, and in women, it is connected to the womb. Its energy communicates with the kidneys, hence it is said there are six organs.

Therefore, we understand that heart conditions from summer heat are accompanied by foul odors.

Yes, it is characterized by a preference for bitter tastes, with deficiency leading to loss of appetite and abundance leading to increased appetite. How can we explain this? The spleen governs tastes; when it affects the liver, it produces a sour taste; when it affects the heart, a bitter taste; when it affects the lungs, a spicy taste; when it affects the kidneys, a salty taste; and when it affects itself, a sweet taste.

Indeed, there is a tendency to sweat that cannot be stopped. How do we discern this? The kidneys govern dampness; when it enters the liver, it leads to tears; when it enters the heart, it leads to sweating; when it enters the spleen, it leads to saliva; when it enters the lungs, it causes nasal discharge; and when it enters oneself, it results in spittle.

Using the heart as an example clarifies the above meaning. A stroke as a virtual pathogen comes afterwards, with fire in front and wood behind. A heat stroke as a correct pathogen is derived from the illness itself (fire). Dietary strain or fatigue is a real pathogen, coming from the front (earth in front and fire behind).

[The Ding clan states: Diseases of the organs are yin, and yin represents stillness, hence they are fixed and do not move.

The heart overcomes the lungs, thus the spleen transmits to the lungs; the spleen overcomes the kidneys, thus the lungs transmit to the kidneys; the lungs overcome the liver, thus the kidneys transmit to the liver; the kidneys overcome the heart, thus the liver transmits to the heart; and the liver overcomes the spleen, thus the heart transmits to the spleen. This is what is meant by the transmission of what gives rise to life. I humbly note that in the \"Su Wen\" on the theory of transmission of primary and secondary ailments, it states: Observe the intervals closely and adjust accordingly. The intervals signify mutual functioning, whereas \"excess\" indicates singular action. The mutual functioning signifies a joint transmission, transmitting what it overlaps, which is similar to Lü Shi's explanation. Singular action signifies a distinctive transmission towards what is overcome, as described in Ji Shi's argument. The principle of the Yue people fundamentally arises from this, detailed in this chapter and in the 42nd chapter of \"Ling Shu.\" However, the principle in these two texts indicates that the transmission occurs among the five organs, along with the stomach and bladder, totaling seven. They elaborate their examples, and each text is named for the transmission of ailments. Now, the Yue people refer to the seven transmissions among the organs, elucidating the principles from these two texts, using the heart as an example to demonstrate the mutual transmission of ailments.

What does this mean? Indeed, the difficulty in treating organ diseases arises because they transmit what overcomes them; conversely, bowel diseases are easy to treat because they transmit what they produce. Treatment approaches for both organs and bowels share similarities in the context of the seven transmissions. Hua Shou remarks: Chen from Siming states that the five organs are guarded internally by the seven spirits, hence the subtle invasions are not easily transmitted. When substantial qi enters, the spirits lose their guard, leading to deeper illness, making treatment challenging, possibly even resulting in death. The six bowels are involved in the processes of transfer and transformation; their qi remains constantly open. Moreover, the gallbladder, being a clear and pure space, makes it difficult for pathogens to linger deep, thus bowel diseases are easier to treat. From the perspective of the Yue people, it can be interpreted that the difficulty in treating organ diseases comes from their ability to transmit what overcomes them, while bowel diseases are easier to treat since they transmit what they generate. However, this is merely one aspect of their nature. If organ diseases transmit what they generate, they would also be easy to treat, and if bowel diseases transmit what overcomes them, they would become difficult to treat. Hence, Pang Anchang often said that among the medical texts of this world, only the words of Bian Que hold depth, which is what the \"Nanjing\" refers to.

Indeed, accumulation pertains to yin qi, while congestion pertains to yang qi. Therefore, accumulation is deep and latent, while congestion is superficial and active. The place where qi accumulates is called accumulation, and the place where qi gathers is called congestion. Thus, accumulation arises from the five viscera, while congestion is produced by the six bowels. Accumulation, being yin qi, has a fixed place of origin; its pain does not stray from its region, with a clear beginning and end, both upward and downward, as well as boundaries to the left and right. Congestion, being yang qi, lacks a fundamental origin; it has no fixed point to pause, and its pain is variable in location, which is why it is termed congestion. Hence, this is how we differentiate between accumulation and congestion. [Shu Shou remarked: Accumulation arises from the five viscera, which are associated with yin and represent stillness; therefore, its ailments are deep-seated and do not leave their location. Congestion comes from the six bowels, which are associated with yang and represent movement; hence, its ailments are superficial and do not remain in one place.] [Yang commented: Accumulation means storage, indicating that when the flow of blood and qi is obstructed, it leads to disease.] [Zhou Zhongli stated: The deep and latent nature of accumulation is initially imperceptible, gradually growing and building up over time.

If it endures for a long time, it can cause coughing and reverse flow, leading to malaria that persists for years. It is obtained on the Wujia days of late summer. How can this be explained? Lung disease transmits to the liver, which should transmit to the spleen. In late summer, the ruler’s body does not accept evils; hence, the liver wants to return to the lung, but the lung refuses to accept it, resulting in a blocked accumulation, thus one knows that fat qi is obtained on the Wujia days of late summer. [Huashou says: \"Fat\" refers to fullness. The presence of a head and foot indicates a significant beginning and end. Cough and reverse flow are the distinctions of the foot jueyin, passing through the diaphragm to the lung. Liver disease causes coughing in the chest. Malaria occurs every two days; according to the Inner Canon, all five organs can have malaria, and here it is associated with wind malaria in the liver. Furthermore, malaria represents cold and heat diseases, mostly belonging to the lesser yang; the liver corresponds in both surface and interior, hence it is said to be beneath the left rib, the region of the liver.] The accumulation of the heart is called \"fuliang,\" arising above the navel, as large as an arm, extending up to below the heart. If it endures for a long time, it causes vexation of the heart. It is obtained on the Gengxin days of autumn. How can this be explained? Kidney disease transmits to the heart, which should transmit to the lung. The lung, in autumn, aligns with the ruler's body, and the ruler does not accept evils; thus, the heart wishes to return to the kidney, but the kidney refuses, resulting in a blocked accumulation, hence one knows that fuliang is obtained on the Gengxin days of autumn.

Why is this said? Diseases of the liver pass to the spleen, while the spleen should pass to the kidneys. The kidneys correspond with the winter, and a sovereign does not accept evil influences; the spleen wishes to return to the liver, but the liver refuses to accept it, hence it remains as an accumulation. Thus, phlegm-qi is known to arise from the winter days of Ren and Gui. [Huashou commented: Phlegm-qi is a blockage that does not flow. Jaundice refers to yellowing.

It is gained on the days of Bing and Ding in the summer. Why is it said this way? The disease of the spleen transmits to the kidneys, and the kidneys are supposed to transmit to the heart; when the heart governs summer, the sovereign does not accept evil influences, so the kidneys want to return to the spleen, but the spleen will not accept it, resulting in an accumulation. Thus, it is known that \"ben tun\" is gained in the summer on the days of Bing and Ding. This is the essential method for the five accumulations. Hua Shou said: \"Ben tun\" is not fixed like the protrusions of a pig; the nature of the pig is restless, hence its name. The cause of wheezing and reverse breathing is the channel of the foot shaoyin, which originates from the lungs and connects to the heart, entering the chest. It is difficult to speak only of the diseases of the viscera without mentioning the diseases of the bowels; Ji's theory states this is because it does not manifest in a constant place. Yang's theory suggests that the six bowels also transmit one another, just as the five viscera do. If one asks about the principles of things in the world, there is sensation and transmission; sensation is feeling, and transmission is qi.

The East corresponds to the liver, so we know the liver is substantial; the West corresponds to the lungs, so we know the lungs are empty. The South drains fire, and the North supplements water. Fire in the South is the child of wood; water in the North is the mother of wood. Water overcomes fire; the child can make the mother substantial, while the mother can make the child empty. Hence, draining fire and supplementing water aims to prevent gold from balancing wood. The classics say that if one cannot address their emptiness, what is there to say about the rest? This is what it means. [Hua Shou said: Gold cannot balance wood; the character \"not\" may be a misreading. The East is substantial, the West is empty, draining the South and supplementing the North indicates that wood, gold, fire, and water seek to balance each other. The desires of wood, fire, earth, gold, and water to be substantial, and the greed of the five elements is controlled and moderated; the balance of gold, water, wood, fire, and earth curbs that greed.]"},{"anchor":"trans-161p","marker":"161p","type":"translation","text":"The text states: When one organ is excessive, it should be balanced by the opposing one. The east corresponds to the liver, the west to the lungs; if the liver is excessive, it is known that the lungs are deficient. If the lungs are not deficient, how could the liver be excessively full? Whether to drain or to supplement, one must temper the excess and remedy the deficiency; this is the way to correct extremes. Water can overcome fire; the son can make the mother full, and the mother can make the son deficient. To drain the southern fire is to take away the energy of the child, allowing the mother to have more; to supplement the northern water is to increase the energy of the child so that it does not rely on the mother. In this way, the excess retreats and the deficiency progresses, allowing metal to balance wood, thus preventing the east and west from experiencing skewed advantages or disadvantages. The view of the Yue people generally suggests that the east is overly full while the west is lacking; hence, fire is drained to suppress wood and water is supplemented to support metal, allowing metal to achieve balance with wood. If one were to desire metal not to balance wood, the preceding and following text would contradict each other and the argument would be incoherent. If the liver's wood is not excessive and the lungs are not deficient, then to drain fire and supplement water is nearly to mix fullness and deficiency. The discussions of the eighty-one difficulties align with this concept. The Cai family of Jiufeng states that water, fire, metal, wood, and earth should mutually control each other to drain excess; their intent is likewise the same."},{"anchor":"trans-162p","marker":"162p","type":"translation","text":"Thus, the concluding statement reads: if one cannot govern the emptiness, why ask about the rest? This serves as a warning for those who understand the constant yet not the variable. The main idea of this text is about the liver being solid and the lungs being weak, focusing on draining fire and supplementing water. Someone might ask: if the son can solidify the mother, and the mother can weaken the son, should we then drain fire and supplement earth? The reasoning is that when the son is abundant, he does not draw from the mother's energy, while if the mother is insufficient, she cannot nourish her son. By draining the southern fire, one deprives the son of energy, allowing the mother to be more abundant; by supplementing the central earth, one enhances the mother’s energy, ensuring her ability to nurture her son. Now, why drain fire and supplement water? It is said: this is the brilliance of the Yue people, achieving two benefits with one action. Moreover, draining fire serves to seize the energy of wood and to eliminate the dominance of metal; supplementing water assists in nourishing the energy of metal while controlling the brilliance of fire. If we were to supplement earth, it would solely aid metal and cannot serve dual purposes, which is why we supplement water instead of earth. Another question may arise: can the mother not make the son solid, and the son make the mother weak, according to the principles of the five elements? Yet, the Yue people assert that the son can solidify the mother and the mother can weaken the son. Why is this? It is said: each has its own interpretation."},{"anchor":"trans-163p","marker":"163p","type":"translation","text":"The mother can make the child substantial, and the child can make the mother empty; this is the generation and transformation of the Five Elements. If the child can make the mother substantial, and the mother can make the child empty, this refers to the gain and loss in the practice of acupuncture, and they are indeed not the same. The Chen family of Siming states: Zhang Zhongjing says: \"Wood overcomes Metal,\" which is called \"Horizontal.\" The \"Huangdi Neijing\" states: \"When Qi is excessive, it controls what it triumphs over, and insults what it cannot overcome.\" When Wood is substantial and Metal is empty, it implies Wood is horizontal and overcomes Metal, thus it insults what cannot be overcome. Wood is originally balanced by Metal, but due to its strong Qi, it becomes horizontal. If Metal balances it, they do not suppress each other and combat ensues; in battle, both the substantial and the empty suffer losses. Metal, being empty, relies on Qi from Earth; however, at that moment Earth is also constrained and cannot sufficiently support it. Thus, Water is seen as the child of Metal and the mother of Wood; hence, it drains Fire and supplements Water, allowing Water to overcome Fire. Consequently, Fire weakens and draws Qi from Wood, thus Wood diminishes and does not become substantial again. Water, as the mother of Wood, can indeed make the child empty. Once Wood is not substantial, its Qi is balanced; when balanced, Metal avoids being overrun by Wood and does not become empty again. Water, being the child of Metal, can indeed make the mother substantial. The saying that Metal cannot balance Wood, and cannot directly use Metal to balance Wood, must drain Fire and supplement Water, treating it indirectly, so that the Qi of Wood and Metal naturally balances each other. According to Chen's statement, there is logic in it; however, for the one word \"not,\" it is entangled and overly strained, not as direct as simply using \"not\" as an extension of the text. In recognizing the 81 chapters, one can see the phrase \"Metal balances Wood\" clearly."},{"anchor":"trans-164p","marker":"164p","type":"translation","text":"The seventy-sixth difficulty asks: What is meant by tonification and depletion? When tonifying, what energy is to be taken? When depleting, what energy is to be placed? Indeed, when tonifying, one takes energy from the protective aspect; when depleting, one places energy in the nourishing aspect. If there is a deficiency of yang energy and an excess of yin energy, one should first tonify the yang and then deplete the yin; if there is a deficiency of yin energy and an excess of yang energy, one should first tonify the yin and then deplete the yang. The communication between the nourishing and protective aspects is essential. [Hua Shou commented: \"In the 'Lingshu' chapter fifty-two, it states that the floating energy not following the meridians is what is referred to as protective energy, while the essence energy that circulates through the meridians is the nourishing energy. Thus, for tonification, one takes the floating energy not following the meridians to replenish areas of deficiency; for depletion, energy is placed from the nourishing aspect without use. 'Place' here means to abandon or set aside. However, a person's illness does not uniformly manifest, and the methods of tonification and depletion are not singular either. Therefore, if there is a deficiency of yang energy while yin energy is in excess, first tonify the yang and then deplete the yin to harmonize; if there is a deficiency of yin energy while yang energy is in excess, first tonify the yin and then deplete the yang to harmonize. In this way, the communication between the nourishing and protective aspects will naturally occur. The methods of tonification and depletion will be discussed in the next chapter.\"]"},{"anchor":"trans-165p","marker":"165p","type":"translation","text":"The seventy-seventh difficulty states: The classics say that the superior physician treats the disease before it manifests, while the intermediate physician treats the disease after it has appeared; what does this mean?

Therefore, one should first strengthen the spleen’s energy, preventing the liver's pathogenic influence from taking hold. Hence, it is said to treat the disease before it manifests. The intermediate physician, when seeing liver illness, does not understand the connection to the spleen and focuses solely on treating the liver; thus, it is said to treat the already manifested disease. [Hua Shou said: When observing liver illness, the superior physician first strengthens the spleen to prevent the pathogen from entering, which is to treat the disease before it manifests. When the intermediate physician sees liver illness and focuses solely on treating the liver, it is to treat the already manifested disease.

The inferior physician needles what is currently active, or what appears to be at its peak, or what has a disease that opposes the pulse.

The methods of tonification and draining do not necessarily require the expulsion of the internal needle during breathing. Those who understand needles trust their left, while those who do not trust their right. When needling, first use the left hand to press and hold down on the area being needled. Then flick and nudge it, grasping and directing the energy as if mimicking the shape of an artery, inserting the needle in the same direction. If you obtain the energy, push it inward, which is called tonification; if you cause it to move and extend, that is called draining. Failing to obtain the energy equates to an irretrievable condition akin to a man outside and a woman inside. Failing to obtain energy is known as \"ten deaths with no remedy.\" [Note: \"Nudge\" is pronounced like \"anger.\"] [Huashou commented: To flick and nudge is to encourage the energy; grasping and directing it slightly heavier is intended to guide the energy to reach. When the energy arrives below the fingers, resembling the shape of an artery, one then takes action to needle it. \"Following\" corresponds to \"bearing,\" while \"taking advantage\" refers to \"seizing.\" Stopping the needle to wait for energy means waiting until the energy arrives and causes the needle to move, which indicates obtaining the energy.]"},{"anchor":"trans-167p","marker":"167p","type":"translation","text":"To push the needle inward is called \"tonification.\" To move the needle and extend it outward is called \"sedation.\" This is the heart technique of the Yue people, not the respiratory method from the inside out.

With a woman, it should be inserted more deeply to feel for the rong qi. If, after this, qi is still not obtained, it is said that the illness is ultimately untreatable. The text uses the term \"qi\" differently in its earlier and later sections; this must not be confused. The earlier mention of qi coming resembles the state of an artery, and refers to the qi felt by the left hand before needling. The later mention of obtaining or not obtaining qi pertains to what is felt under the needle itself; these are two separate sections. Zhou Zhongli said: In all cases of feeling for qi, the left hand should apply slight pressure. If qi cannot be felt, then with a man, lighten the touch on the wei qi to feel it; with a woman, apply more pressure on the rong qi to feel it.

Loss refers to letting go or leaving behind. In the second chapter it says: 'To speak of substance and emptiness, as if present or absent,' refers to substance having essence and emptiness lacking it.

In the case of heart disease, the heart represents fire. The earth is the offspring of fire, with the hand’s heart region being the location Tai Ling. Draining it is to 'welcome and seize.' Wood is the mother of fire, and the hand’s heart region being the location Zhong Chong. Replenishing it is to 'follow and assist.'

This is called \"having a perception like entering\" and \"having a perception like exiting.\" [Hua Shou says: The phrase \"having a perception like entering\" should be accompanied by \"having a perception like exiting.\" For example, read \"ruo\" (如) in a similar manner as \"yue\" (月). In Mengzi, it is written that one observes the Dao but does not yet see it, thus \"ruo\" can be used interchangeably.

The needle is inserted, and when the qi response is felt to be exhausted, the needle is withdrawn.] The Eighty-First Difficulties state: The scriptures mention \"no substance, substance, void, and emptiness, reducing what is insufficient while increasing what is excessive,\" does this refer to the cun (寸) pulse? Does a condition inherently have void and substance? How are reduction and increase related? Indeed. This condition does not refer solely to the cun pulse but indicates that the condition itself has void and substance. For instance, if the liver is full and the lungs are deficient, the liver corresponds to wood and the lungs to metal, which must balance each other; one should realize that metal must stabilize wood. Conversely, if the lungs are full and the liver is slightly deficient in qi, one should not tonify the liver but rather reduce excess in the lungs. Hence it is said, \"substance, substance; void, void; reduce what is insufficient while increasing what is excessive.\" This represents harm done by those of intermediate skill. [Hua Shou says: The two characters for \"this condition\" should be disregarded as errors or additions.
