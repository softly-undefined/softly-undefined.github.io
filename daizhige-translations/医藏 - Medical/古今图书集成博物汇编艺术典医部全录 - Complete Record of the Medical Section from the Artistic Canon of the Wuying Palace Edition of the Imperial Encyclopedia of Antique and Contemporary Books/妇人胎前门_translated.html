<p>Women&#39;s Pregnancy Entrance</p>
<pre><code>     Yellow Emperor&#39;s Plain Questions

         Discussion on Yin and Yang

The separation of Yin and Yang is said to indicate conception.
[Note: The &quot;separation of Yin&quot; refers to a smooth and strong pulse at the wrist. The &quot;separation of Yang&quot; refers to the pulse at the inch position, appearing to diverge without connecting. This is indicative of pregnancy, as there are internal changes, which is why the pulse at the wrist feels smooth and round like a pearl.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Theory of Human Vitality</strong></p>
<p>If a woman&#39;s hand exhibits strong pulsations in the little yin pulse, she is pregnant.<br>[Note: &quot;Child&quot; refers to a male. By examining the wrist of a woman&#39;s two hands, if the little yin kidney pulse in the left hand is strong, she is expecting a boy, while a strong pulse in the right hand indicates a girl.]</p>
<p><strong>Theory of Strange Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: Why does a person remain immobile for nine months and become mute? Qi Bo replied: This is due to the obstruction of the connecting vessels of the womb.<br>[Note: The connecting vessels of the womb refer to the vessels associated with the uterus. When pregnancy reaches the ninth month, the womb is fully developed; if there is any obstruction in the connecting vessels, it can result in them being blocked and not functioning.] </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How do you know this? Qi Bo answered: The connecting vessels of the womb are linked to the kidneys; the little yin pulse penetrates the kidneys and connects to the base of the tongue, hence the inability to speak.<br>[Note: The pathway of sound is governed by the heart, which manages speech, while the lungs manage voice. However, the movement of energy between the kidneys rises to the tongue, enabling the production of sound; therefore, the tongue is considered the mechanism of sound. The connecting vessels of the womb are associated with the arms, and the little yin pulse, which penetrates the kidneys and connects to the base of the tongue, indicates that if the connecting vessels of the womb are obstructed, the little yin pulse is also blocked, preventing the tongue from functioning and resulting in mutism.]</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How should this be treated? Qi Bo replied: There is no treatment; it will resolve in ten months.<br>[Note: At ten months, when the fetus emerges, the connecting vessels will be unblocked, and the ability to produce sound will return.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Six Elements and Proper Timings</strong></p>
<p>Regarding women carrying a heavy burden, how should one approach toxicity? Qi Bo said: If there are reasons, there will be no miscarriage; if not, there will also be no miscarriage. The Emperor asked: I wish to understand what this reason is. Qi Bo replied: Great accumulation and great gathering may be offended; reduce it by more than half and stop there. If there is excess, it leads to death. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;Heavy burden&quot; refers to the weight of pregnancy; &quot;toxicity&quot; refers to medicines that are excessively cold or hot. During pregnancy, from the first to second month, the wood element governs nurturing; the third and fourth months are ruled by fire; the fifth and sixth months relate to earth; the seventh and eighth months are associated with metal; and the ninth and tenth months pertain to water. By the time the sun is fully set, all five elements have circulated, and the yin and yang of water and fire separate, resulting in the formation of the body after birth. Prior to birth, the energies of the five elements have both abundance and deficiency, dominance and stagnation; thus, one should adjust using methods of cold, heat, warmth, coolness, following or opposing the natural order. If a condition arises, wishing to avoid excessive cold or heat, there should be no harm to the fetal energy, which means there are reasons for no miscarriage, yet one must also not overreach to cause a miscarriage. Just like great accumulation and gathering pertain to the organs corresponding to the five elements, one must be cautious of offending cold and heat. If there is an excess offense, it will lead to death.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji)<br><strong>General Discussion on Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>When a woman has a tranquil pulse and a weak yin pulse, experiences thirst without appetite, and shows no signs of cold or heat, this is termed pregnancy, and Gui Zhi Decoction is the appropriate remedy. In general, this symptom should appear within sixty days. If treated incorrectly and symptoms reverse, with one month adding to vomiting and diarrhea, it should be considered at an end. </p>
<p>For women experiencing excessive bleeding after childbirth that does not cease, or bleeding during pregnancy, if there are symptoms of painful distention in the abdomen, indicating a blockage, Jiao Ai Decoction is the appropriate remedy. </p>
<p>When a woman is six or seven months pregnant, if her pulse is taut and her temperature is elevated, and she feels significant abdominal distention with pain and aversion to cold—especially if the lower abdomen feels like a fan—this indicates that the uterus is opening; thus, Fu Zi Decoction should be used to warm the organs. </p>
<p>For abdominal pain during pregnancy, Dang Gui and Shao Yao Powder is indicated. </p>
<p>For persistent vomiting during pregnancy, Gan Jiang, Ren Shen, and Ban Xia Pill is the remedy. </p>
<p>If a pregnant woman has difficulty urinating but maintains her appetite, Dang Gui, Bei Mu, and Ku Shen Pill is suitable. </p>
<p>For water accumulation during pregnancy, with sensations of heaviness, difficulty in urination, cold sweats, and dizziness upon standing, Kui Zi and Fu Ling Powder should be used. </p>
<p>Pregnant women should regularly take Dang Gui Powder as a general tonic.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>During pregnancy and nurturing the fetus, the Bai Zhu San is the main formula for it. </p>
<p>For women with pre-existing conditions, if they experience continuous bleeding within three months after a menstrual period has stopped, and if the fetus is moving above the navel, this indicates a serious condition. If the movement occurs in the sixth month, it indicates that everything was normal during the first three months; if there is bleeding afterward, it suggests a significant problem. The reason for continuous bleeding is that the condition has not been resolved. In such cases, Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan is the primary remedy. </p>
<p>For those with pre-existing conditions who become pregnant, and if they experience continuous bleeding after three months, with the fetus moving above the navel, this also indicates a serious issue. Generally, fetal movement occurs around the navel, and movement above indicates a problem. </p>
<p>If the pulse at the Cun Kou is tight and large, a tight pulse suggests a reduction in function, and a large pulse indicates excess. A reduced pulse suggests cold, while an excess pulse indicates deficiency. The interplay between cold and deficiency is termed &quot;Ge,&quot; and for women experiencing excessive bleeding, Xuan Fu Hua Tang is the prescribing formula.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Food Taboos</strong></p>
<p>Deer fat and plums; if a pregnant woman eats them, her child may be born with blue blindness. A woman in pregnancy should avoid eating rabbit, goat, turtle, chicken, and duck meat, as it may render the child voiceless. Pears are said to induce cold; thus, postpartum women should also refrain from eating them. If a pregnant woman eats ginger, it may lead to the child being born with excess fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong> (by Wang Shuhe of Jin Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Song of Various Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Blood flows down like the moon&#39;s tide, stopping at the source can lead to the loss of the fetus. This also harms the pregnant mother and causes worry; urgently seek divine pills to remedy the situation. Severe abdominal pain turns the face pale; cold sweat and breathlessness signal impending death. Constant bleeding pushes the fetus upwards; coldness in the heart and abdomen certainly harms the body. If weight is lifted while pregnant, it can lead to the fetus dying within. Loss and persistent bleeding before delivery lead to chaos in the heart and a lonely soul for the mother. Cold-induced headaches affect all joints; breathlessness brings heavy sensations as if drowning in blood. When reddish-black spots appear, persistent heat extinguishes the fetus. Continuous vomiting causes distress and heat, while sore backs and splitting headaches arise. If heat remains in the abdomen for six or seven days, urine may be obstructed and stools constipated.</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on the Pulse of Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse in the middle is uninterrupted, it indicates the true fetal pulse. A strong pulse on the Taiyin indicates a female pregnancy, while a strong pulse on the Yang indicates a male pregnancy. If both are strong, it may lead to twins. This method of assessment shows effects as if by divine intervention. Count the months based on specific sections. If it seems to pulsate in the center, it means the pregnancy will last up to nine months.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Qianjin Fang (Tang - Sun Simiao)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Evil Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>For women who are weak and emaciated, lack sufficient blood and energy, and have weak kidney energy, if they are usually unregulated in their emotions or excessively exposed to cold winds while drinking, and if there is dampness in their hearts, they are likely to experience difficulties when they desire to conceive. The term “desiring to conceive” refers to individuals whose menstrual cycle still arrives, whose complexion and skin appears normal, yet they feel heavy and depressed, lack appetite, and do not know the source of their ailment; if their pulse is stable and harmonious, then it indicates a desire for pregnancy. After two months, when they feel an obstruction, it indicates the presence of a fetus. </p>
<p>The symptoms of obstruction include a troubled heart, heavy head, dizziness, heaviness in all limbs, fatigue and reluctance to engage in activities, aversion to certain food odors, a craving for salty and sour fruits, and preferring to lie down. It is often referred to as “evil food.” By three or four months, the symptoms can escalate to severe vomiting and an inability to manage the situation. This is due to menstrual blood being blocked, causing dampness in the organs, and lack of flow resulting in discomfort and nausea. When blood and channels are obstructed, the limbs feel heavy; when wind is involved, it leads to dizziness. </p>
<p>When such signs are present, it is advisable to take several doses of Banxia Fuling Decoction, followed by Fuling Pills with light water to facilitate appetite. Once strength and vitality increase, the mother will be healthy, and the fetus will be well-nourished. There are dozens of remedies for treating obstruction throughout history; regardless of whether the condition stems from deficiency, excess, cold, or heat, those who are gravely ill can find life through this method, which is too numerous to list.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Nurturing the Fetus</strong></p>
<p>According to ancient teachings, during the first three months of pregnancy, the fetus is undergoing changes and its qualities have yet to stabilize. Therefore, during these three months, one should aspire to see rare and precious items such as rhinoceroses, elephants, ferocious beasts, jewels, and treasures. One should wish to encounter wise and virtuous individuals, masters of great virtue, and observe proper rituals, music, and military arrangements. Incense should be burned, and one should recite poetry and classical wisdom, both ancient and modern, for guidance. The living space should be simple and quiet; one should avoid improper food and seating arrangements. Activities such as playing the zither should be employed to regulate the mind, harmonize emotions, and temper desires. By maintaining a tranquil life, the child will generally be healthy, long-lived, loyal, filial, benevolent, righteous, wise, and free of ailments. This can be attributed to the prenatal education imparted by King Wen.</p>
<p>When the child is still in the womb and the months are not complete, the balance of yin and yang is not yet attained, and the organs, bones, and joints have not fully developed. Thus, from conception until just before delivery, there are various dietary and living restrictions. Consuming mule meat during pregnancy can lead to difficult childbirth.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>During pregnancy, eating rabbit and dog meat causes the child to be mute and have a cleft lip.<br>Eating eggs and dried carp during pregnancy leads to the child having many sores.<br>Eating mulberries and duck during pregnancy causes the child to feel a cold heart.<br>Eating sparrow meat and fermented soybeans during pregnancy results in the child having dark spots on the face.<br>Eating sparrow meat and drinking alcohol during pregnancy leads to the child having lustful emotions and shamelessness.<br>Consuming ice during pregnancy results in miscarriage.<br>Pregnant women should not relieve themselves in unusual places, as it may cause harm to half the fetus.  </p>
<p>During the first month of pregnancy, known as the beginning of the embryo, the diet should be light and nutritious, favoring sour and sweet foods; barley is recommended, and strong flavors should be avoided, which is called proper nourishment.<br>In the first month of pregnancy, the foot Jueyin pulse must be nurtured, and acupuncture should not be performed on its channels. The foot Jueyin pertains to the liver, which governs tendons and blood. At this time, blood flow should not be stagnant, strenuous activities should be avoided, and resting should be calm without fear.<br>In the first month of pregnancy, the union of yin and yang forms the fetus; excess cold causes pain, while excess heat leads to sudden fright. Lifting heavy objects causes lower back pain, and a full abdomen may result in urgency. These should be addressed with calming measures, and black hen soup is recommended.<br>In the second month of pregnancy, known as the beginning of the fat formation, spicy and dry foods should not be consumed; women should stay in tranquil places, men should not exert themselves, and all joints may ache, indicating the early development of the fetus.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>In the second month of pregnancy, the Lesser Yang Pulse of the foot is nourished, and one must not needle or apply moxibustion to its meridian. The Lesser Yang of the foot is associated with the gallbladder and governs essence. During this month, the essence of the child is formed in the womb, and one must take care to avoid disturbances.</p>
<p>In the second month of pregnancy, the interaction of yin and yang begins, and excess cold can cause complications, while excess heat may lead to decay. Cold wind may cause fluctuations, resulting in fullness in the heart and urgency below the navel, along with lower back and hip pain. If there are sudden episodes of chills and fever, one should take a mugwort leaf decoction.</p>
<p>In the third month of pregnancy, known as the beginning of the fetus, there is yet no fixed form. When encountering objects, the fetus may change, and if desiring a boy, one should practice archery, whereas to conceive a girl, one should play with pearls. To wish for a beautiful child, one should frequently gaze at jade; to wish for a virtuous child, one should sit quietly in a clear and empty space. This reflects external appearances and inner feelings.</p>
<p>In the third month of pregnancy, the Heart Pulse of the hand is nourished, and one must not needle or apply moxibustion to its meridian. The Heart governs internal functions, and one should avoid sadness, excessive thought, and disturbances.</p>
<p>By the third month, the shape is determined. If there is cold, the stool may be blue; if there is heat, urination may be difficult, either not red or yellow. Sudden fear and worry can lead to emotional instability, triggering changes in the meridians, causing fullness or pain around the navel or lower back. If there are sudden episodes of distress, one should take a rooster decoction.</p>
<p>In the fourth month, the essence of water begins to form blood vessels. One should eat rice and congee, and the soup should contain fish or wild goose, which nourishes blood and facilitates the ears and eyes and the flow of meridians.</p>
<p>In the fourth month, the Lesser Yang Pulse of the hand is nourished, and one must not needle or apply moxibustion to its meridian. The Lesser Yang of the hand connects to the Sanjiao (Triple Warmer), and during this month, the child&#39;s six viscera begin to develop. One should maintain a calm form, harmonize the mind, and regulate diet.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>In the fourth month of pregnancy, there is chilliness, a warm sensation under the heart with a desire to vomit, fullness in the chest and diaphragm with no appetite, heat with difficulty in urination, frequent and painful like a drip, urgently painful beneath the navel, sudden onset of wind and cold, pain and stiffness in the neck, alternating chills and fever, or disturbances in the body, pain in the lower back and abdomen occurring occasionally, pressure from the fetus on the chest, agitation and inability to find peace, and sudden descent of something. One should use chrysanthemum soup.</p>
<p>In the fifth month of pregnancy, one begins to receive the essence of fire to nurture its energy. It is essential to rise late from sleep, bathe and wash clothes, deepen the living environment, and wear thick clothing. In the morning, absorb the sunlight to ward off cold calamities. One should eat rice and wheat, and consume soup made from cattle and sheep, seasoned with gardenia and balanced with the five flavors, which is said to nurture energy and stabilize the five organs.</p>
<p>During the fifth month of pregnancy, nourishing the foot Taiyin meridian is crucial; acupuncture should not be performed along this meridian. The foot Taiyin connects to the spleen, and at this time in May, the limbs of the baby are fully formed. There should be no great hunger, no excessive fullness, no dry foods, no self-heat generated, and no extreme labor and fatigue.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>In the fifth month of pregnancy, if there is heat manifesting as a bitter headache, dizziness, and chaotic heart with vomiting; or if there is cold leading to a bitter, full abdomen with painful, hard, and frequent discomfort, along with sudden fear, pain in the limbs with alternating cold and heat, irregular fetal movement, abdominal pain causing dizziness and a desire to collapse, and sudden discharges, then a decoction of Ejiao (colla corii asini) should be administered.</p>
<p>In the sixth month of pregnancy, one begins to absorb essential elements to strengthen the muscles. The body may feel slightly fatigued, and one should avoid quietude; instead, they should go out into the fields, observe running dogs and horses. Diet should consist of the meat of predatory birds and fierce beasts, as this is said to transform the skin and strengthen the muscles, thereby nurturing strength and solidifying the body.</p>
<p>In the sixth month of pregnancy, the foot yangming meridian nourishes; acupuncture should not be performed on its pathway. The foot yangming corresponds to the stomach, which governs the mouth and eyes. By this sixth month, the child’s mouth and eyes are fully developed; flavors should be balanced, with emphasis on sweet and delicious foods, while avoiding excessive fullness.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>During the sixth month of pregnancy, there are disturbances and unease, with alternating cold and heat, abdominal distension, body swelling, sudden fright, and a sensation of impending labor accompanied by abdominal pain, and discomfort in the hands and feet. One should take a decoction of Ophiopogon.</p>
<p>In the seventh month of pregnancy, the essence of wood begins to form the bones. One must avoid overexertion, and should engage in movements that flex and stretch to circulate blood and qi. The living environment must be dry, and one should avoid cold foods and regularly consume glutinous rice to strengthen the skin and teeth.</p>
<p>In the seventh month, the hand Taiyin meridian nourishes the body, and acupuncture should not be applied to this channel. The hand Taiyin is associated with the lungs, which govern the skin and hair. By the seventh month, the child&#39;s skin and hair have formed, so there should be no loud shouting, no crying, no thin clothing, no baths, and no cold beverages.</p>
<p>In the seventh month, if sudden fright occurs, abdominal pain arises, and there is a sensation of something descending, along with coldness in the hands and feet, with a pulse feeling slightly cold and restless, and distension in the abdomen with shortness of breath, often accompanied by neck and back tension, one should use a scallion white soup to treat it.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>In the eighth month of pregnancy, the essence of earth begins to form skin and flesh. The heart should be calm and resting, and the vital energy must not be excessive. This is called the delicate pores, producing luster and color.</p>
<p>In the eighth month of pregnancy, the hand&#39;s yangming channel nourishes; needling and moxibustion on this channel is not allowed. The hand&#39;s yangming is connected internally to the large intestine, controlling the nine orifices. By this month, all nine orifices of the infant are complete. Avoid dry foods, do not miss meals, and do not let anger rise excessively.</p>
<p>In the eighth month of pregnancy, if one suffers from cold wind and is harmed, the body will feel pain, alternating between cold and hot, and one will be restless, often suffering from dizziness, with pain around the lower abdomen indicating cold. Urine may be as white as rice water, sometimes blue or yellow, perhaps causing chills, and the back and waist may be cold and painful; this is treated with Shaoyao Decoction.</p>
<p>In the ninth month of pregnancy, the essence of stone begins to form skin and hair. All six bowels and joints are fully developed. Enjoy sweet drinks and tasty food, and maintain a gentle pace as you await the arrival; this is called nourishing the hair and cultivating strength.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>During pregnancy, in the ninth month, the kidney&#39;s lesser yin meridian is nurtured, and one should not use acupuncture or moxibustion on its channels. The lesser yin internally pertains to the arms, and the kidneys are responsible for continuity. By the ninth month, the child&#39;s veins are fully formed; there should be no moisture or coldness, nor should one wear heavy clothing.</p>
<p>In the ninth month of pregnancy, if one suddenly experiences diarrhea with a full and urgent abdomen, the fetus may press against the heart. If there are pains in the lower back that prevent turning, and shortness of breath, one should take Banxia Decoction.</p>
<p>In the tenth month of pregnancy, all five organs are complete, and the six intestines are unblocked, absorbing the air of heaven and earth into the elixir field, hence the essence of both human and divine beings is ready, simply awaiting the right time for birth.</p>
<p>Pregnancy starts in the first month with the formation of the fetus, develops into essence in the second month, forms the womb in the third month, shapes the body in the fourth month, begins to move in the fifth month, establishes the muscles and bones in the sixth month, grows hair in the seventh month, has all internal organs complete in the eighth month, has grain essence entering the stomach in the ninth month, and all spirits are ready in the tenth month, leading to delivery when the time is right. It is advisable to take miscarriage-preventing medicine. In the eighth month, one should take Danshen extract to nurture the fetus, and in the final month, prepare for an easy delivery.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p>
<h3>Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The floating and large pulse on the left wrist indicates a male, while the sinking and fine pulse on the right wrist indicates a female. If there is a sudden interruption, it indicates unfavorable conditions regarding the moon and water.</p>

<h3>Treatment Methods for Febrile Illness in Pregnant Women</h3>
<p>For a pregnant woman suffering from febrile illness, there is no standard treatment prescribed by Zhongjing. Medication should be used with caution and should not be applied as it would be for ordinary women. For febrile illness while pregnant, it is advisable to use Ejiao powder or Baizhu powder. </p>
<p>If there are symptoms of fever and aversion to cold, one should induce sweating using scallion white soup. If febrile illness presents with chills, trembling, and palpitations, one should use Sonmu soup. For headache due to febrile illness accompanied by loss of appetite, pain in the flanks, and nausea, Huanglong powder is recommended. </p>
<p>In cases of heat-related headache, aversion to cold, high temperature causing restlessness, pain in limbs, stiffness in the back and neck, and dry lips, Chaihu Shigao soup should be used. When febrile illness persists for four to six days, with additional symptoms like abdominal distension, shortness of breath, unquenchable thirst, little food intake, and lower back pain, Zhisuan powder is appropriate. </p>
<p>For headache with dizziness from febrile illness, along with high fever and anxiety, Xuanfu flower soup is recommended. If there is severe fever, vomiting, headache, and restless fetal energy, Maimendong soup should be used. If a pregnant woman develops a rash that turns black, Zhizhi Dayqing soup is indicated. </p>
<p>For severe headache and high fever, accompanied by irritability and vomiting with no food intake, Lu Gen soup is recommended. If the fever and headache persist, Zhi Zi Wu Wu soup is advisable.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>In cases of cold damage with headache, limb and joint pain, and strong fever, it is advisable to use Qihu Qiwu Decoction. For pregnant women in the seventh month experiencing cold damage with strong fever, red spots turning black, and blood in the urine, it is suitable to use Shengma Liuwu Decoction. For fever and agitation, Ge Gen Yiwutang Decoction is recommended. In cases of heat illness, it is appropriate to use Congbai Chi Decoction.</p>

<p>General Discussion</p>
<p>According to &quot;Chao&#39;s Sources of Disease&quot;: In the first month of pregnancy, it is called embryo, nourished by the Foot Jueyin Meridian. In the second month, it is called beginning of fat, nourished by the Foot Shaoyang Meridian. In the third month, it is called beginning of fetus, nourished by the Hand Shenyin Meridian. At this time, blood does not circulate, the form begins to take shape, and there is no established pattern, thus it reacts to environmental influences. If desiring a proper and dignified child, one should often speak proper words and engage in proper conduct; if wanting to have a boy, it is advisable to wear a bow and arrow; if wanting a girl, one should wear ornamental accessories; to have a beautiful child, one should wear white jade; to have a wise and capable child, one should read poetry and books. This is called external appearance influencing internal response. In the fourth month, the essence of water is received to form blood vessels, nourished by the Hand Shaoyang Meridian. In the fifth month, the essence of fire is received to form Qi, nourished by the Foot Taiyin Meridian. In the sixth month, the essence of metal is received to form tendons, nourished by the Foot Yangming Meridian.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>In July, the essence of wood begins to form the bones, nourished by the hand of the Taiyin channel. In August, the essence of earth begins to form the skin and flesh, nourished by the hand of the Yangming channel. In September, the essence of stone begins to form the hair, nourished by the foot of the Shaoyin channel. In October, the five organs, six bowels, and joints are all complete, with both spirit and divinity present. This is a general overview. Additionally, the discussion on the five organs mentions a term &quot;Qi Po&quot;: In January, resembling dew on pearls; in February, like peach blossoms; in March, the division of genders; in April, the complete form appears; in May, the tendons and bones are formed; in June, the hair begins to grow; in July, the soul roams, and the child can move the left hand; in August, the spirit roams, and the child can move the right hand; in September, the three turns of the body; in October, the qi is fully received. Moreover, the &quot;Lü Shen Jing&quot; states: In January, it is the coagulation of the essence and blood of the fetal sac; in February, the fetal formation as an embryo; in March, the yang spirit becomes the three souls; in April, the yin spirit becomes the seven phantoms; in May, the five elements differentiate into the five organs; in June, the six laws are established for the six bowels; in July, the essence opens the orifices, connecting to brightness.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>In August, the original spirit is complete, and the true spirit descends. In September, the structures of the palace are established, and human life begins. In October, the energies are fully received, and all phenomena are formed. Now, if we delve into numerical theories, those resembling the discussion of the five viscera are all shallow and vulgar, wrongly attributing their names. As for the Tripitaka Buddhist texts, they are often bizarre and unfathomable. Now, referencing the &quot;Luhuan Sutra,&quot; which consists of three volumes, it states that ancient shamans composed it. The discussion of the Nestorian school asserts that pregnancy begins with the formation of the fetus in the third month; this leads to discussions of legitimate words and actions, wearing corded belts, holding bows and arrows, and adorning oneself with rings and white jade, which is akin to the principles of胎教 (fetal education). It is advisable to consider the Nestorian school&#39;s assertion about the nourishment principles of pregnancy, which relate to the Jueyin Liver Meridian and the Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian, indicating one internal organ&#39;s channels. The seasonal influences naturally commence in spring with wood, thus the nourishment of the twelve meridians begins with the liver, suggesting that fetal nourishment occurs in the first and second months.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The palm corresponds to the heart, and the Hand Shaoyang Sanjiao meridian, associated with fire, thrives in summer, hence nurturing the fetus in March and April. The Hand Taiyin and Hand Yangming correspond to the heart meridian, representing the sovereign&#39;s authority, ungrasped yet revered. The Foot Taiyin corresponds to the spleen, and the Foot Yangming corresponds to the stomach, associated with earth that flourishes in late summer, thus nurturing the fetus in May and June. The Hand Taiyin corresponds to the lung, and the Hand Yangming corresponds to the large intestine, associated with metal that thrives in autumn, hence nurturing the fetus in July and August. The Foot Shaoyin corresponds to the kidney, associated with water that flourishes in winter, thus nurturing the fetus in September. Moreover, the mother&#39;s kidney is linked to the fetus, representing the mother’s true essence that the child relies on. By the tenth month, the child in the mother’s womb receives nourishment from all the vital energies of the organs before awaiting the right time to be born. This discussion is profound and contains essential truths; in the world, there are clearer explanations, yet none surpass the theories of the Nest Clan. Thus, I present this discourse.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p>
<h3>On Prenatal Education</h3>
<p>Books on prenatal education cannot be dismissed as irrelevant or without merit, yet they should not be treated lightly. Nowadays, in homes of common folk and among those of improper nature, there is little care for avoidance of taboos, leading to negligence. It is fortunate if one does not suffer from harmful substances or is not affected by wind and dew, resulting in both mother and child remaining safe. However, to ensure a healthy pregnancy, one must take various precautions to prevent future issues. For instance, if a neighbor undertakes construction work, it may disturb the prenatal energy, potentially harming the child. Just as injuries can occur from sharp objects, impurities from mud can obstruct passages, physical impacts can cause discoloration, and bindings can lead to muscle constraints. Such phenomena are evident and must not be disregarded.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Chapter on the Original Conception</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of great beginnings, there was the Tai Chu, and in the commencement of great initiation, there was the Tai Shi. When chaos was first differentiated, the essence became evident; thus it is called Tai Chu. Once forms were established, it was designated Tai Shi. When the essence initially took shape, heaven and earth were interdependent, creating and transforming, manifesting all things. Hence it is said: Great is the source, as everything takes its beginnings! Profound is the nurturing earth, for all things draw life from it! At the onset of birth, though the positive aspect of Yang is predominant, nurturing and fulfilling, it is essential to understand that Yin is of greater significance. Due to the transformation of forms, days shift and months change, marking the end of the cycle governed by the earth’s way. This is called conception; when Yang has commenced, it is upheld by Yin, known as Renzi. This is referred to as the womb; with the self being the positive Yang, enveloped by Yin. This is called the embryo; it has not yet formed into a vessel, still referred to as clay. This is called the fetus; it has already fed on its mother, for sustenance. If pregnancy manifests, it stirs at the proper times; if it is but a carrying, the body relies upon it. The virtue of heaven, the essence of earth, and the extreme harmony of Yin and Yang flow together as one body; one must follow the seasonal rhythms, be mindful of human affairs, and refrain from actions that could inflict harm, thereby mastering the path of nurturing. Observing the cycles of the four seasons - growth, storage, and emergence - all myriad forms manifest, harmoniously fitting the measures, while the essence of heaven and earth has never been lacking; indeed, Yin and Yang support and complement one another.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Examining Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>If a woman’s meridians do not flow, and it has been three months, wishing to verify if there is a fetus, take Chuanxiong and grind it into powder, then mix two qian with a strong decoction of mugwort and take it. If there is a slight movement within the abdomen, then there is a fetus.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Avoiding Taboos Related to Fetal Termination and Protecting the Fetus Before Conception</strong></p>
<p>Once pregnant, one must diligently avoid the taboos associated with fetal termination. As the classics state: those affected by knives will surely suffer harm, those who encounter mud will have their orifices blocked, those who experience strikes will turn pale and dark, and those who are tied will have their muscles strained and cramped. This may even lead to the mother&#39;s demise; disaster can strike like a snap of the fingers. </p>
<p><strong>Monthly Observances of Fetal Termination</strong><br>Beginning of spring should be in the bedroom, the awakening of insects at the door (single window), Qingming at the gates (double doors), the beginning of summer at the stove, grain planting on the mother’s body, slight heat at the stove, the beginning of autumn at the millstone (as some texts state, it is due north), White Dew should be in front of the kitchen, Cold Dew at the door, the start of winter at the door and in the kitchen, heavy snow at the stove and hearth, and slight cold in the mother’s room.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Observances of Fetal Termination by the Ten Heavenly Stems</strong><br>On days of Jia and Ji, one should occupy the door; on Yi and Geng days, the mill; on Bing and Xin days, the well and stove; on Ding and Ren days, the kitchen and storeroom; on Wu and Gui days, the rice granary.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Observances of Fetal Termination by the Twelve Earthly Branches</strong><br>On Zi and Chou days, occupy the main hall; on Yin, Mao, Chen, and You days, occupy the stove; on Si and Wu days, occupy the door; on Wei and Shen days, occupy under the fence; on Xu and Hai days, occupy the room.</p>
<p><strong>Ten Heavenly Stems and the Fortnightly Observances of Fetal Termination</strong><br>During the Jia-Zi period, occupy the windows and mill; during the Jia-Xu period, occupy the main hall; during the Jia-Shen period, occupy the courtyard; during the Jia-Wu period, occupy inside the house; during the Jia-Chen period, occupy within the house; during the Jia-Yin period, occupy the two doors.</p>
<p><strong>Observances from the Grand Historian&#39;s Bureau</strong><br>Every time one encounters Gui-Si, Jia-Wu, Yi-Wei, Bing-Shen, Ding-You five days, be in the northern part of the house.<br>For Geng-Zi, Xin-Chou, Ren-Yin, be in the southern part of the house.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>On the first day of the Guiliao month, I was in the room facing west. </p>
<p>On the fourth day of the Jiachen, Yisi, Bingwu, and Dingwei months, I was in the room facing east. On the sixth of the Jixi day, I was in the central part of the room. Other days were without occupation. </p>
<p>For all activities inside the house, it is not advisable to be in certain positions; setting up beds and curtains and cleaning the space, all bring misfortune. Moreover, there are dangers for small children and the three fatal dangers of the year; maternal health is affected by certain fateful decisions, and these should not be violated. After conception, it is crucial to keep this notice visible in the room and strictly avoid activities such as digging, moving nails, or placing heavy objects against the walls. Violating these can result in severe consequences: either a miscarriage or harm to the mother; if less severe, it may lead to deformities in the child, such as shrinkage or muteness. Violating these warnings yields significant effects.</p>
<p><strong>Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>After conception, it is imperative to avoid certain foods, not only for the sake of the fetus but also due to their physical properties. If one cannot adhere to these restrictions, it may not only prolong labor but could also harm the mother and deform the child. </p>
<p>Consuming chicken meat and glutinous rice together can cause white worms in the child. Eating lamb liver can bring misfortune to the child. Eating carp sashimi and eggs can result in sores. Dog meat can render the child voiceless. Rabbit meat can cause cleft lips. Eating turtle can lead to a short neck and fetal harm. Crabs can cause abnormal births. Soybean paste with shiso can induce miscarriage. Ginger can lead to ulcers on the child&#39;s fingers. Consuming frog, eel, or snake can make the child mute. Eating donkey or horse meat can prolong labor and make delivery difficult.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Prohibited Medicines for Pregnant Women</strong></p>
<p>Leeches, toads, and earthworms, aconite and fuzi paired with tianxiong. Wild kudzu, mole crickets, huanghua and various insects. Cattle bile, mercury, and dazi, as well as snake skin and centipedes. Cow’s knee and reed, along with coix. Metal powders, tin, and both male and female substances.

Qumai and sheanzhuru, crab claws and shells, weasel skin with arrows and the red-headed ones. Horse knives, stone, silk, fish, etc., and banxia and nanxing mingled with coix. Dried ginger, garlic, chickens and eggs, donkey meat and rabbit meat should not be offered. Pregnant women must strictly abstain from these, this song should be kept in mind. </p>
<p><em>Note: According to medicinal texts, rhubarb, sulfur, peach kernels, safflower, sophora flower, tiger&#39;s claw, wolf teeth, wildflower, field mouse, sorrel, houttuynia, and euphorbia are all forbidden.</em><a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is referred to as a fetal illness in &quot;The Treasure of Childbirth,&quot; and termed &quot;nausea and vomiting&quot; in &quot;The Sources of the Chao Family.&quot; This condition arises from weak stomach qi, phlegm stagnant in the middle burner, with a pulse that is harmonious and steady. However, the limbs feel heavy, the head becomes dizzy, and there is a selective craving for sour and salty foods. In severe cases, there may be cold, heat, vomiting, and a feeling of fullness in the chest and diaphragm. The main treatment is the Banxia Fuling Pill. </p>
<p><em>Note: If the symptoms include phlegm stagnation in the middle burner, use Erchen Decoction with Zhike. If there is food stagnation, use Liu Junzi Decoction with Zhike. If the spleen and stomach are weak, use Yigong Powder. If the stomach qi is insufficient, use Ren Shen and Chen Pi Decoction. For accompanying emotional distress, add Zhike. If there is chest and hypochondriac oppression, add Sugeng. For hypochondriac pain, add Chaihu. If there is little appetite and excessive thinking, use Liu Junzi Decoction with Zisu and Zhike. For dizziness and fatigue, use Liu Junzi Decoction. If the spleen and stomach are weak with vomiting and lack of appetite, use Banxia Fuling Decoction, as Banxia is the chief herb for strengthening the spleen and transforming phlegm stagnation.</em><a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>If one has a weak spleen and stomach leading to vomiting, or if phlegm and fluids are obstructed, with little appetite and an unsettled fetus, one must use modified Fuling Banxia Decoction with increased Baizhu. Banxia, Baizhu, Fuling, Chenpi, and Sharen are effective at calming the fetus and strengthening the spleen and stomach, and I have often used them effectively.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Complete Compendium,&quot; there are varying severities of obstructive conditions; mild cases do not require medicine, but severe cases must be treated with medication. The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; uses the Banxia Fuling Decoction and Fuling Pill specifically to treat these obstructive diseases. However, these two prescriptions have been rarely used lately, since Banxia has the nature of provoking the fetus. For a fetus that is just beginning to settle, there is a concern that it could easily disperse; this must be approached with caution. In &quot;Discussion of Cold Damage,&quot; Zhang Zhongjing mentions using Huanglong Decoction, which is Baizhu Decoction without Banxia. This is likely meant for pregnancy. </p>
<p>Wang Ziheng has a Baizhu Powder, &quot;Jufang&quot; has a Ginseng and Clove Powder, Yang Zhen has a Ginseng and Tangerine Peel Decoction, and Qi Shipeng offers a Xingspi Drink—none of these use Banxia, and they all have multiple effects.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Unsettled Fetal Movements</strong></p>
<p>When a woman has a strong and robust stomach Qi, along with harmonious Chong and Ren, the fetus can settle properly, like a fish in deep water. However, if the Qi and blood are weak and unable to nourish, the fetus ultimately cannot develop, and it is advisable to induce labor to avoid disaster. </p>
<p>(Note: For earlier symptoms, one should use methods addressing back pain during pregnancy. If the fetus cannot be settled, only then should one consider inducing labor, doing so with utmost caution!)</p>
<p>Fetal movements during pregnancy can be influenced by various factors: diet and daily activities, exposure to wind and cold affecting Chong and Ren, accidental falls or impacts, anger harming the liver, or a weakness of spleen Qi. Each cause should be identified and treated accordingly. If the fetal movements are caused by the mother&#39;s illness, one should treat the mother. Conversely, if the fetal movements lead to the mother&#39;s illness, the focus should solely be on stabilizing the fetus. </p>
<p>In mild cases, there may be unsettled movements, while severe cases could result in miscarriage. If the face is red and the tongue is blue, it indicates fetal death; if the face is blue and the tongue is red with froth at the mouth, it signals maternal death; if both lips and mouth are blue with froth coming out on both sides, it indicates the death of both mother and child.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Observe and manage accordingly. </p>
<p>[Note: For cases where fetal qi is stagnant, use a perilla drink. For those with weak spleen qi, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added perilla seed. For stagnation harming the spleen, use the Return to the Spleen Decoction with added coptis. For anger affecting both liver and spleen, use the Four-Seven Decoction with added angelica and chuanxiong. If liver fire is provoked by anger, add a modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If the fetus is already deceased, urgently use Ping Wei Powder with (stone salt) to dissolve. According to the comprehensive texts, unsettled fetal movement during pregnancy is due to deficiency in the Chong and Ren meridians leading to improper conception; it may also stem from excessive drinking and intercourse causing instability, or impact from external force causing fetal movement. Emotional disturbances like joy or anger affecting the heart and liver may also disturb the blood vessels. Additionally, over-reliance on medicinal warmth and tonics could harm instead. If maternal illness affects fetal movement, treating the maternal condition will naturally stabilize the fetus. When the fetus is not firmly anchored and movement affects the mother’s health, simply securing the fetus will also heal the mother.]<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Leaking Blood from the Fetus</strong></p>
<p>When menstruation occurs during pregnancy, it is due to the deficiency of the Chong and Ren channels, which cannot maintain proper regulation. The heart and small intestine channels are interrelated; the former governs breast milk, while the latter governs menstrual blood. Therefore, during menstruation, the blood is obstructed to nourish the fetus and provide milk. If menstruation occurs, it is called &quot;fetal leakage,&quot; and if the blood is completely lost, it leads to death.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the condition is due to wind-heat, use Fang Feng Huang Qin Wan. If due to blood-heat, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. If due to blood deficiency, use Er Huang San. If due to excessive blood loss, use Ba Zhen Tang; if ineffectual, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If due to liver fire, use Chai Hu Shan Zhi San. If due to spleen fire, use Jia Wei Gui Pi Tang. If the bleeding is painful, use Ba Zhen Tang with added Ejiao and cooked Ai Ye. If due to weak spleen and stomach, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Wu Wei Zi added. If due to sinking of the spleen and stomach, use the previous formula with increased Sheng Ma and Chai Hu.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>If there is internal heat in the afternoon heat, one should use the Xiaoyao Powder. According to the &quot;Great Compendium&quot;: The term &#39;miscarriage&#39; refers to a situation where menstruation occurs during pregnancy after several months. This is due to the deficiency of the Conception and Penetrating vessels, which cannot control the blood of the Yangming and Shaoyin channels. The Conception and Penetrating vessels are considered the sea of the meridians, originating from inside the womb. The Hand Taiyang Small Intestine channel and the Hand Shaoyin Heart channel are its interior and exterior, and they are related to milk production above and menstrual blood below. In pregnant individuals, menstruation ceases because of the obstruction necessary to nurture the fetus and provide nourishment for milk. When the energy in the Conception and Penetrating vessels is deficient, the internal womb leaks and cannot contain the menstrual blood, resulting in its flow during the monthly cycle, also known as &#39;womb leakage&#39;; if the blood is entirely lost, it leads to death. Additionally, factors such as overexertion, excessive emotions, irregularity in diet, consumption of cold foods, and exposure to wind and cold can lead to fetal movements. If the mother has a chronic illness, the fetus may be affected by wind and cold, resulting in imbalances in Qi and blood, and causing instability in the pregnancy, which can lead to bleeding.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>There was once a case where a pregnant woman continued to have her monthly cycle without harm to the fetus, and someone consulted the obstetrician Xiong Zonggu. He replied: When a woman&#39;s blood is abundant and her vital energy is weak, she tends to be plump. After conception, if her monthly cycle continues without disturbance to the fetus, one might mistakenly consider this as a case of miscarriage. If treated as a miscarriage, the fetus is sure to be lost. However, if no treatment for miscarriage is applied, the fetus may still survive. Based on Zonggu&#39;s words, there is indeed wisdom. The Chao family states that when a woman experiences absence of menstruation without other afflictions, it is said that she is with child, as her menstrual blood is retained to nourish the fetus and to produce milk. After conception, the resources are used to nourish the fetus; how can they still disperse and be in motion? Therefore, if a pregnant woman regularly experiences her monthly cycle, it does not necessarily mean it is due to abundant blood. If we say that a woman’s menstruation is affected by wind, then her menstrual blood may be inclined to move because the wind is strong. But if the menstruation is overwhelmed by wind, the forthcoming blood is not the nurturing blood for the fetus.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>To distinguish this, if one treats a threatened miscarriage, they must take restorative medicine to support the fetus, so the fetus is not harmed. If one forcefully uses medicine to nourish it, what is known as substantial and insubstantial will occur, and the fetus will surely be lost. If the physician treats it as if there is a wind in the channels, relying solely on one medicine for wind, it may be proper to stop or not take medicine, and the fetus will also remain unharmed. However, if the fetus is inherently unstable due to lack of restraint in intimate relations, leading to initial bleeding followed by miscarriage, one must treat the threatened miscarriage, and this must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Bleeding during pregnancy is caused by an imbalance of hot and cold, emotional disturbances, and disharmony of qi and blood. If it harms the fetus, there will be pain and bleeding, and in severe cases, it may lead to miscarriage.</p>
<p>Notes: If the indication is due to anger, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. If due to wind-heat, use a single ingredient Fang Feng pill. If due to blood heat, use a single ingredient Ziqin pill. If due to weakness of spleen qi, use Liu Junzi Decoction. If due to sinking of middle qi, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If there is strong qi and blood with bleeding, it is due to the child being small and drinking little, and no medicine is necessary.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Shock and Miscarriage</strong></p>
<p>Shock during pregnancy occurs when the expectant mother is near term, the fetal spirit is fully present, but a shock injures the fetus, even leading to bleeding and unconsciousness. To assess the well-being of both the mother and child, one should consider the irregularity of fetal movement and treat accordingly. </p>
<p><em>Note: If the condition is due to anger, falling, or limb spasms, use Diaoteng Decoction. If caused by Qi stagnation, use Zisu Drink. If due to spleen and stomach Qi deficiency, use Six Gentlemen Decoction with added perilla stem. If it is an emotional disturbance that injures the spleen, use Gui Pi Decoction. If frustration and anger harm both Liver and Spleen, use Si Qi Decoction with added Chuanxiong and Gui. If there is excessive bleeding, use Fo Shou Powder; if that doesn&#39;t work, use Jiao Ai Decoction. For Qi and blood deficiency, use Ba Zhen Decoction with added gelatin and mugwort.</em><a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Qi Ascending</strong></p>
<p>If pregnancy is nurtured according to the proper methods, then the blood and Qi harmonize, the fetus is in its proper place, and childbirth is easy. Otherwise, if the fetal movement causes Qi to reverse, childbirth becomes difficult and may even be perilous. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there are symptoms of Qi reversal with the fetus high, use perilla drink; if appetite is poor, combine it with Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is internal heat with afternoon heat, combine with Xiao Yao San. If due to stomach fire, use Four Gentlemen, Huang Qin, Zhi Ke, Chai Hu, and Zhi Zi. If caused by spleen stagnation, use Gui Pi Tang with added Chai Hu, Zhi Zi, and Zhi Ke.</p>
<p><strong>Frequent Miscarriage</strong></p>
<p>The fetus is formed by Yang acting on Yin, requiring harmony of nourishment and defense to flourish, resulting in a delivery after ten months. If the blood and Qi are weak, they cannot nourish the fetus, leading to frequent miscarriages. Pregnant women who experience back pain are more likely to miscarry. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> According to Danxi, when blood and Qi are deficient and cannot nourish the fetus, it leads to miscarriage. It is like a withered branch causing the fruit to fall, or a wilted vine causing the flowers to drop. He also notes that miscarriages are more common due to internal heat and deficiency, especially during the first three months when it is associated with Yang fire, making miscarriage easier. If not, how can Huang Qin,熟艾 (mugwort), and Ejiao (ass hide glue) be so effective in preventing miscarriage? Generally, treatment methods must be carefully aligned with the months and associated meridians for nurturing and medication.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Growth Issues</strong></p>
<p>In cases where fetal growth is insufficient during pregnancy, it may be due to pre-existing ailments or disharmony, leading to weakened organs and insufficient qi and blood, thus hindering fetal development. Treating the underlying ailments and nourishing qi and blood will result in natural growth of the fetus. 【Note: One should further examine specific meridians to determine the cause and treat accordingly.】</p>
<p><strong>Premature Labor Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>If pregnancy is not yet full term but there are pains resembling labor, or if labor is difficult or the child is distressed, one may use Zhimu (Anemone) as the sole ingredient, forming it into pills the size of a tung seed to be taken with porridge; or mix equal parts of Huai seed and Puhuang (Catkins) into pills to be taken with wine; or mix Puhuang with water in a coin-sized amount and apply similarly. 【Note: Miscarriage is more serious than full-term delivery. A full-term delivery is like a ripe fruit falling naturally, while a miscarriage is like breaking a root before it has a chance to grow. Is this not serious? Yet many disregard it, resulting in many deaths. Generally, the treatment should focus on nourishing physical strength and qi, generating new blood, and removing stagnant blood as the priority. If pain occurs before full term and mimics labor, use Xuanguishen and Guizhong Decoction, increasing the amount of Zhimu to soothe the pain. If there is excessive bleeding after labor, use Ren Shen (Ginseng) and Huang Qi (Astragalus) decoction for nourishment. If there is pain in the heart and abdomen post-delivery, use Danggui Chuanxiong Decoction. If the vital energy is weak and there is a desire to give birth, use Ba Zhen Tang (Eight Treasure Decoction) to stabilize it. For excessive bleeding accompanied by fever, use Shengyu Decoction. If sweating does not stop or there are symptoms like confusion, gasping, or coughing, urgently apply Dushen Decoction.**<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If there is fever and irritability, or if there are muscle spasms, use the Eight Treasure Decoction. If there is great thirst and a red face, with a pulse that is surging yet weak, use the Angelica Blood Nourishing Decoction. If there is body heat and a red face, with a pulse that is deep yet faint, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with ginger and aconite to restore the yang. Dongyuan states: if there is fever during the day and calm at night, it means the yang energy is flourishing. If there is calm during the day and feverish irritability at night, it means the yang energy is descending into the yin. If there is fever both day and night, it signifies an excess of yang without yin; one should nourish the yin. Wang Taifu states: if there is great cold yet fever persists, it indicates a lack of fire. If heat comes and goes, presenting during the day and retreating at night, with night heat halting by day, it demonstrates a lack of fire. If there is great heat yet extreme cold persists, it indicates a lack of water. If heat moves and stops suddenly, shifting in and out at times, this also indicates a lack of water. If the yang energy is flourishing, use the Middle Benefit Qi Decoction. If the yang energy is trapped in the yin, use the Four Herbs and Two Licorice Decoction. If there is an excess of yang without yin, use the Four Herbs Decoction. If there is no fire, use the Eight Flavor Pill. If there is no water, use the Six Flavor Pill.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Child Distress</strong></p>
<p>For those who experience anxiety and distress during pregnancy, in the fourth month, one should receive the fire of the lesser yin to nourish essence; in the sixth month, the fire of the lesser yang to nourish qi. If the mother feels frightened and anxious, this often indicates such symptoms. &quot;The Birth Treasure&quot; states it is due to the heart and lungs being deficient and overheated, or phlegm accumulating in the chest. If the distress occurs in the third month, it is merely heat. If phlegm and fluid cause distress, there may be vomiting of saliva and aversion to food. Generally, when phlegm and fluid accumulate, and cold and heat clash causing vomiting, it can lead to fetal movements becoming unstable. </p>
<p>[Note: For the aforementioned symptoms due to internal heat, use bamboo leaf decoction; for qi stagnation, use perilla drink; for phlegm stagnation, use Er Chen (Two Aged) decoction with bai zhu (white atractylodes), huang qin (scutellaria), and zhi ke (bitter orange); for qi depression, use fen qi drink with chuan xiong (sichuan lovage); for spleen qi deficiency, use Six Gentlemen decoction with perilla and gardenia.]<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Ghost Fetus</strong></p>
<p>When a woman&#39;s organs are in harmony, her blood and qi are abundant, and her spirit is strong, then wind and evil spirits cannot harm her. If the protective energy (wei) is weak and her spirit is diminished, then supernatural beings can invade her organs, resembling the state of pregnancy; thus, it is called a ghost fetus.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If this condition arises due to the seven emotions causing deficiency in the spleen and lungs, leading to weak qi and blood, deviating from its normal path, then it is a matter of insufficient original qi and excess pathogenic qi. If there are irregularities in the pulse, adjustments should be made to restore balance, avoiding this condition. The treatment method focuses primarily on replenishing original qi, supplemented by dispersing agents like arsenic pills. If there is stagnation in the spleen meridian leading to reversed qi, modify the Gui Pi Decoction for supplementation. If there is spleen deficiency and insufficient blood, use Six Gentlemen Decoction with Chuanxiong and Angelica to nourish it. If liver fire consumes the blood, use an enhanced version of Xiaoyao Powder to nourish and suppress it. If there is liver and spleen stagnation due to anger, take the modified Gui Pi and Xiaoyao medicines together. If both kidney and liver are weak, use Six-Ingredient Pill with Rehmannia.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Difficulty in Urination</strong></p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant and experiences difficulty in urination, it is caused by heat in the small intestine that obstructs the bladder. If there is also stagnation of qi in the heart and lungs, it may lead to shortness of breath. Chen Wuzhe states that when the fetus is large and pressing on the bladder, it often results in difficulty in urination. If there is deficiency of qi in the heart and kidneys, the clear and turbid fluids may collide, leading to various forms of dysuria. If the fetus is improperly positioned, leading to obstruction in urination, it is called &quot;transformed bladder.&quot; If the fetus is large enough to obstruct the outflow of urine, it is called &quot;enuresis.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Danxi, difficulty in urination due to the bladder being pressed often stems from the weakness of the pregnant woman, who may be anxious and easily agitated, potentially consuming rich foods. Traditional remedies using lubricating and guiding herbs have shown limited effectiveness. If the bladder is merely being pressed by the fetus and cannot expel urine, simply elevating the fetus may allow the bladder to become unobstructed and enable urination. If there is distention in the abdominal area, with obstruction to urination, this indicates a deficiency of spleen and stomach qi, with the fetus pressing on the bladder. The Four Substances, Two Chen, ginseng, and atractylodes can be taken in an empty stomach; vomiting several times may bring relief. I suggest that the prior condition may also indicate deficiency of spleen and lung qi, unable to descend to the bladder; there may also be stagnation of heat in the bladder preventing the proper flow of fluids, or excessive damp-heat in the spleen and earth contributing to the obstruction. Further careful inquiry and treatment should be administered.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Zi Lin</strong></p>
<p>In cases of pregnancy where there is frequent urination known as &quot;Lin,&quot; it is caused by the deficiency-heat of the kidneys and bladder that fails to control water. The pregnant woman’s womb is linked to the kidneys, and when there is deficiency-heat in the kidneys, this condition arises. In severe cases, there may be irritability and confusion, termed &quot;Zi Lin.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there is a painful cramp in the neck and an expectoration of phlegm, use Ling Yang Jiao San. If urination is scant and dripping, use An Rong San. If there is damp-heat in the liver channel, use Long Dan Jie Gan Tang. If there is deficient-heat in the liver channel, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. If there are cramps in the legs and feet and urination is not smooth, urgently use Ba Wei Wan; if delayed, it may be beyond saving. If dry medications lead to frequent or difficult urination, use Sheng Di Huang, Fu Ling, Niu Xi, Huang Bo, Zhi Mu, Xiong, Gui, and Gan Cao. If urination is frequent and the urine is yellow, use Si Wu with Huang Bo, Zhi Mu, Wu Wei Zi, Mai Men Dong, and Yuan Shen. If there is deficiency of lung qi causing reduced urination, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Shan Yao and Mai Men Dong. If there is a weakness in the yin, with frequent urination, use Di Huang Wan. If heat stagnates in the bladder causing difficulty, use Wu Lin San. If the spleen and lungs are dry and unable to generate fluids, Huang Qin Qing Fei Yin is advisable. If the bladder yin is deficient with no yang production, use Zi Shen Wan. If the bladder yang is deficient with no transformation of yin, use Shen Qi Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> According to the &quot;Three Causes&quot; discussion: The treatment for pre-labor Lin should primarily stabilize the fetus. Whether treating with hot or cold, or based on symptoms like stones or gas, one should assess the deficiencies and strengths, investigate the causes, and select medications accordingly to ensure the right approach.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Edema from Fetal Water</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Collection on Lactation&quot; states: At three months of pregnancy, if the feet swell to the legs, with water retention, loss of appetite, and a condition resembling edema, this is referred to as &quot;fetal qi.&quot; It does not dissipate until childbirth, indicating a deficiency in the spleen and stomach, or possibly blood wind in the Chong and Ren vessels. The &quot;Record of Famous Physicians&quot; mentions that the Song Crown Prince discreetly learned needling techniques from Xu Wenbo. When Wenbo observed a pregnant woman with swollen feet and felt her pulse, the Crown Prince remarked: &quot;This is a female form.&quot; Wenbo replied: &quot;This is a male fetus, located on the left and dark.&quot; He then used acupuncture, and the fetus was indeed expelled. There can also be spleen deficiency causing excess water. This may arise from diarrhea leading to cold in the organs, or from malaria causing water retention, leading to spleen deficiency and damp accumulation, or water stagnating in the womb, unable to be discharged, all resulting in swelling of the legs, feet, and abdomen. </p>
<p>[Note: For previous symptoms such as chest fullness, abdominal distension, difficulty in urination, and generalized edema, use carp soup. For spleen and stomach deficiency, assist with the Four Gentlemen decoction.]<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>If the face is hollow and the body feels like vapor, use the full dosage of Bai Zhu San; if there is no response, use Liu Jun Zi Tang. If there is spleen deficiency with damp-heat and swelling in the lower body, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with added Fu Ling. If there are dietary issues leading to vomiting and diarrhea, use Liu Jun Zi Tang. If the legs and feet swell, accompanied by shortness of breath and restlessness, or if water seeps from between the fingers, use Tian Xian Teng San; for spleen and stomach weakness, you can also use Si Jun Zi Tang; if ineffective, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. If there is Qi stagnation in the spleen and lungs, use Jia Wei Gui Pi Tang, complemented with Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. </p>
<p>According to &quot;Chan Bao&quot;: Swelling during pregnancy is due to weak visceral Qi and excessive burden from pregnancy, where the earth does not control water, and blood disperses into the limbs, leading to abdominal distention and swelling in the hands, feet, and face, along with urinary retention. Chen Wu Ze remarks: Women with chronic wind, cold, and dampness often experience swollen feet during pregnancy, commonly known as &quot;wrinkled feet.&quot;<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>There is also a condition where the body becomes entirely swollen, with a feeling of tightness in the heart and abdomen, known as &quot;pregnancy water.&quot; During pregnancy, when blood is obstructed to nourish the fetus, if there suddenly appears swelling, it is due to water accumulating within the fetus, causing water and blood to clash. The spleen and stomach are affected by dampness; when dampness weakens the energy, it leads to muscle weakness, resulting in the body becoming swollen. The causes can be various: it may arise from diarrhea or dysentery, affecting the internal organs and depleting the spleen and stomach; or it may stem from coldness, heat, or malaria, along with excessive thirst and drinking, which dampens the spleen and stomach, leading to swelling of the face or limbs. If there is water in the womb and the fetus is not yet fully formed, it may cause damage. As labor approaches, a slight swelling may be felt, indicating that there is little water and more blood in the womb, allowing for easier delivery. If there is lingering cold energy, it can cause abdominal swelling and fullness due to exposure to cold.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>According to the &quot;Collection on Lactation,&quot; it is said that after three months of gestation, when the fetus is formed, the legs and knees gradually swell starting from the feet. Walking becomes difficult, leading to shortness of breath, and yellow fluid appears between the toes, which only subsides upon childbirth. This is attributed to the woman having a constitution prone to wind, or issues with the Chong and Ren meridians involving blood wind, thus indiscriminate use of herbal medicine is not advisable. It is also feared that excessive strain near the time of delivery could pose unforeseen risks, so it is imperative to treat the condition before childbirth. Few ancient texts mention this; &quot;Records of Famous Physicians&quot; refers to swelling in the feet during pregnancy. However, &quot;Chao&#39;s Source of Illness&quot; only discusses childhood troubles, while &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; and &quot;Treasures of Childbirth&quot; briefly touch on the issue. Liu Yuhuang in &quot;Continuation of Transmission of Medical Knowledge&quot; considers that water vapor contributes to fetal development during pregnancy, and &quot;Taiping Shenghui&quot; states similarly, both of which are not correct. In the Yuanfeng era, Chen Jingchu from Huainan, a renowned physician, uniquely provided a formula for treating this condition, initially called Xiangfu Powder, later renamed by Li Boshi as Tiānxian Tendrils Powder.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Borborygmi in the Pregnant Woman&#39;s Abdomen</strong></p>
<p>To treat the borborygmi in a pregnant woman’s abdomen, take powdered soil from a mouse&#39;s burrow, mix it with musk, and adjust it with wine, administering two qian; it will resolve immediately. Alternatively, a strong decoction of barberry can be given to the mother to sip regularly. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: According to &quot;Chan Bao,&quot; if the child cries in the womb, the same treatments of soil from a mouse&#39;s burrow or strong barberry decoction will suffice, as these are remedies suggested for the condition. It also mentions that a lump on the umbilical cord occurs when the child’s mouth is agape because the pregnant woman stretches or lifts her arms, causing the child to vocalize. In such cases, the mother should bend down as if to pick something up, allowing the child to return to the mouth, which will stop the sound. However, as barberry is cold in nature and musk opens the orifices, their usage should be measured accordingly.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p>
<h3>Dampness and Sadness</h3>
<p>Scholar Xu said: If a woman weeps for no reason multiple times, it is called dampness and sadness; treating her with a jujube soup will bring recovery. Also, Cheng Huqing, five months into her pregnancy, experienced severe sadness and was cured by the jujube soup. [Note: The preceding condition may be due to cold water attacking the heart, or evil wind in the lungs; treatment should be carefully considered.]</p>
<h3>Pulse Examples</h3>
<p>Wang Ziheng said: In pregnancy, if the pulse in all three positions is slippery, large, and rapid, then if it is stronger on the left, it indicates a male child; if stronger on the right, it indicates a female child. The classics state: &quot;Yin engulfs yang, indicating the presence of a child.&quot; The engulfs refers to nearness, as the yin pulse approaches below and the yang pulse emerges above; observing yang within yang confirms that the yang produces the transformation of yin, suggesting the presence of a child. Furthermore, when the shaoyin pulse is very active, it indicates pregnancy. The hand shaoyin belongs to the heart, and the foot shaoyin belongs to the kidneys; the heart governs blood and the kidneys govern essence. When essence and blood intertwine, conception occurs. Additionally, if the three positions of the pulse are equally floating and sinking without disease, it also indicates pregnancy. A floating and exuberant pulse at the left wrist indicates a male fetus; at the right wrist, a female fetus. If both wrists show a floating and exuberant pulse, it indicates two males; if both are sinking and solid, it indicates two females. Additionally, if the middle finger has one throb and one stillness, it indicates a one-month fetus; two throbs and two stillnesses indicate a two-month fetus.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>Diagnosis of Women with Pregnancy Songs</p>
<p>The liver accounts for blood, the lungs for qi; blood represents nourishment, qi represents defense. When yin and yang are harmoniously paired, the organs are interconnected as a standard. If blood is deficient and qi is abundant, there will be no pregnancy; if blood is abundant and qi is deficient, pregnancy will occur. </p>
<p>[Note: The liver stores blood and is associated with yin; the lungs govern qi and are associated with yang. The harmonious pairing of yin and yang refers to the matching of husband and wife, leading to conception. If blood is low and qi is strong, there will be no pregnancy; if blood is strong and qi is low, pregnancy is likely. Zhang Shixian stated: The liver stores blood, the lungs govern qi; blood belongs to yin and flows within the vessels, while qi belongs to yang and flows outside the vessels. Qi rises, blood rises; qi descends, blood descends; in the harmonious pairing of yin and yang, there are no discrepancies. The Three Yin and Three Yang work together, ensuring that both organs are in harmony and conform to their patterns. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Gold and wood are the fundamental beginnings of life and death.]<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>&quot;Wood is abundant and gives life; metal is abundant and brings death. The pulse at the cun is fine, at the guan is slippery, and at the chi is scattered and flowing, moving like the pecking of a sparrow. The pulse of a child is already visible, while the mother is still unaware after several months of pregnancy. </p>
<p>[Note: The fine pulse at the cun, slippery pulse at the guan, and the scattered, flowing pulse at the chi indicate that the meridians are blocked and have not functioned, resulting in pregnancy. These pulses suggest abundance of blood and deficiency of qi, indicating the shape of a child is already apparent.]</p>
<p>A swift left pulse indicates a boy; a quick right pulse indicates a girl, both flowing smoothly and swiftly. The pulses in both hands correspond greatly; the shape is already in the front and can be verbally expressed. </p>
<p>[Note: A swift pulse in the left hand indicates a boy, while a swift pulse in the right hand indicates a girl. Furthermore, if the pulses are flowing and swift and correspond greatly, it confirms that the fetus already has a shape.]</p>
<p>The left pulse indicates two boys; the right hand indicates one pair of girls.&quot;<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;Zong&quot; indicates that the husband rides on the wife, water rides on fire, and metal rides on wood; this is the pulse of the ghostly bandits, known as &quot;Zong.&quot; If found in the left hand, it indicates the expectation of two sons. The &quot;Heng&quot; indicates that the wife rides on the husband, with fire riding on water and wood riding on metal; this is the pulse of victory, known as &quot;Heng.&quot; If found in the right hand, it indicates the expectation of a pair of daughters.</p>
<p>The left hand&#39;s pulse predicts three sons, while the right hand&#39;s pulse predicts three daughters. <strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;Ni&quot; indicates that the son rides on the mother, with water riding on metal and fire riding on wood; this is the pulse of self-birth, known as &quot;Ni.&quot; If found in the left hand, it predicts three sons. The &quot;Shun&quot; indicates that the mother rides on the son, with metal riding on water and wood riding on fire; this is the pulse of giving birth to self, known as &quot;Shun.&quot; If found in the right hand, it predicts three daughters.</p>
<p>The pulses at the inch, the gate, and the cubit are all interconnected; one son and one daughter correspond to distinct shapes.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>The notes state that the pulse characteristics at the cun, guan, and chi positions correspond to the pregnancy of one boy and one girl. It is said that the guan position represents yang (male) and the after guan represents yin (female), hence the corresponding pulses indicate the presence of both a boy and a girl.</p>
<p>Sometimes a child may die while the mother lives, or the mother may pass away while the child survives. When the three positions of the pulse flow smoothly and interchangeably, with a slippery and rapid rhythm, it indicates that the yang is full and the yin is deficient, causing a rebellious qi that fills the chest.</p>
<p>If all three pulse positions are flowing smoothly and interchangeably with strength and a slippery rhythm, it indicates a yang fullness and yin deficiency, suggesting that a pregnant woman experiences rebellious qi throughout the chest, leading to discomfort.</p>
<p>In the left hand, the sun pulse is large and floating for a boy; in the right hand, the yin pulse is small and sinking for a girl. The left hand&#39;s cun position represents the sun, where a large floating pulse indicates a boy, while the right hand&#39;s cun position represents the yin, where a sinking fine pulse indicates a girl.</p>
<p>All yang represent boys, and all yin represent girls; this distinction is clear and should be remembered.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The notes state: &quot;The &#39;yang pulses&#39; refer to the characteristics of major illnesses that are numerous, smooth, and firm, indicating a pregnancy with a male. The &#39;yin pulses&#39; refer to those that are deep and fine, indicating a pregnancy with a female.&quot; </p>
<p>It further explains that the three sections of the pulse (cun, guan, and chi) should be neither absent nor irregular, and within the chi section, if the pulse is palpable continuously, it signifies a true pregnancy. </p>
<p>The text discusses the dynamics between husband and wife: &quot;When the husband embraces the wife, it is like the flow of air and fog; when the wife embraces the husband, it represents the horizontal flow of energy.&quot; </p>
<p>The explanation continues that the &#39;vertical&#39; dynamic refers to the husband embracing the wife, with water overcoming fire and metal overcoming wood, symbolizing the pulses of control by the ghostly thief. The &#39;fog&#39; aspect refers to moisture and the interaction of upper and lower energies—indicating the husband&#39;s yang energy encompassing the wife&#39;s yin energy, akin to fog nourishing and producing offspring. The &#39;horizontal&#39; dynamic depicts the wife embracing the husband, with fire overcoming water and wood overcoming metal, symbolizing the pulses of domination.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The horizontal energy assists, meaning the lateral energies support each other. When the child rides on the mother, it is in opposition; when the mother rides on the child, it is in harmony. </p>
<p>(Note: The opposition refers to the child riding the mother, where water influences metal and fire influences wood, corresponding to generating one&#39;s own pulse. The opposing energies refer to the child’s energy clashing with the mother’s energy, creating a counteracting flow. In the harmonious state, metal influences water and wood influences fire, corresponding to the generation of one&#39;s own pulse, wherein the mother&#39;s energy takes precedence over the child&#39;s energy, supporting each other. In general, the embryo grows by means of the four energies of opposition and harmony to nourish and solidify its form.)</p>
<p>As for an infant during the final stages of gestation, when the body is heated and the pulse is chaotic, there are no signs of distress.</p>
<p>(Note: When a woman is five months pregnant, this is when the count begins to see the embryo well-formed and coalescing. The mother&#39;s body must be robust and warm, and at this point, the pulse will be dry and disordered, which is not a sign of illness. This indicates that the fetus has been formed by receiving the essence of fire to develop energy, hence the warmth and pulse irregularity indicate wellness rather than sickness.)<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>When sweating occurs without eating and there is nausea during pregnancy, the spirit becomes unsettled and remains within. This indicates that the embryo receives the vital essence of the five elements to take shape and depends on the two channels to nourish its mother. By the fifth month of pregnancy, although the embryo is formed, its energy is not yet stable. Therefore, the fetal qi ascends to disturb the heart and chest, leading to sweating, lack of appetite, and nausea, a condition known as &quot;vomiting and counterflow,&quot; commonly referred to as &quot;selective food cravings,&quot; where the mother craves sour and spicy tastes to regulate the fetal qi. According to Chi, when a woman initially conceives, it is akin to the birth of water (the essence), and in the second month, it receives the qi of fire, causing the pregnant woman&#39;s body to heat up and her pulse to become chaotic, resulting in sweating, lack of appetite, and nausea. In the third month, it receives the qi of wood, and the spirit settles within, harmonizing the energy to nourish the child while the child&#39;s qi moistens the mother, allowing both energies to nourish and stabilize the child. </p>
<p>If there are lingering ailments beyond three months of pregnancy, it indicates that the condition persists beyond five months for the mother. </p>
<p>In summary, the first three months of pregnancy are referred to as the initial stage, where there is no established pattern, necessitating nourishment from the heart and channels.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>The pulse, when observed as slippery and rapid, indicates a condition of insufficient qi and excess blood; if it is not dispersed, it signifies a strong presence of blood and qi, which initially leads to a conception. A pulse that is merely rapid and does not disperse represents a mother in her fifth month of pregnancy.</p>
<p>For pregnant women, an ideal pulse should be tight, strong, slippery, and rapid as a sign of auspiciousness. If the pulse is deep, fine, and weak, it does not correspond with the physical condition, hence it is deemed a sign of death. Although the earlier text mentions the taiyin pulse as deep and fine and also states that various yin indicate femininity, these assertions seem contradictory. However, if the three pulse positions are neither deep nor fine and weak, they are indeed different. </p>
<p>Additionally, according to Tong Jinzi, the earlier mention of the taiyin pulse being deep and fine is thought to indicate a peaceful pregnant pulse, while this current description of deep, fine, and weak pulses as signs of death seems contradictory. Generally, a pregnant woman&#39;s pulse should be tight, strong, and slippery as a sign of health; if all three pulse positions are deep, fine, and weak, it indicates a sign of death.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy Carbuncle</strong></p>
<p>To treat a pregnancy carbuncle, use five qian of black medicine, one sheng of water, decoct until reduced by a third, then add one liang of beef tendon glue, decoct until dissolved and take warm; alternatively, drink the decoction made from barley. </p>
<p>Note: Pregnancy carbuncle refers to an internal abscess during pregnancy.

<p>Morning sickness, commonly referred to as &quot;bad food.&quot; The treatment method is to regulate the energy and blood, resolve phlegm and guide fluids, then strive for peace. For pregnant women with confusion in the heart area, nausea, not eating, aversion to food smells, headache, and aches in limbs and joints, it is advisable to use a mixture of Rotated Over and Half Summer Decoction. For morning sickness with cold sensation in the chest and abdomen pain with vomiting, not liking drinks, use Ginseng and Half Summer Decoction. For a pregnant woman with gastric deficiency, who experiences reversed energy with vomiting and lack of appetite, use Sand Shrinking Powder.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Child Distress</strong></p>
<p>In the fourth month of pregnancy, one receives the Qi of the Lesser Yin to nourish the essence; in the sixth month, one receives the Qi of the Lesser Yang to nourish the vital energy. Thus, there is much distress and dissatisfaction. If, two months later, there is still distress, it is because the mother has lost balance, the seven emotions have been affected, causing anxiety and fear; for this, use Maimendong Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Correcting the Virtuous Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>Question: What is the reason for restless fetal movement in the third or second month of pregnancy?<br>Answer: The interaction of male and female Yin and Yang, along with the balance of blood and Qi, results in successful conception. However, if there is bleeding from below or abdominal pain, it is due to prolonged deficiency of the uterus, leading to fetal miscarriage, which is more dangerous than a normal birth. If previously affected by such distress, one may take Du Zhong Pills to nourish the fetus.</p>
<p>Question: What is the cause of abdominal pain with fetal movement?<br>Answer: The reasoning for abdominal pain during fetal movement isn&#39;t uniform. It can arise from the consumption of hot or cold foods, exposure to wind or toxic substances, or from excessive shifting and shaking that injures the womb. This often leads to vomiting and disharmony of Qi. If someone has overly taken hot medicine, leading to disharmony of Qi and blood, they should quickly take mild medicine to calm the fetus. Otherwise, it could result in a miscarriage, making it difficult to settle. A sacred decoction could also be considered.</p>
<p>Question: What about abnormal menstrual flow during pregnancy?<br>Answer: When pregnancy is established, yet the fetal breath is not solidified, this may be due to shock or excessive physical labor that injures the womb, or from ingesting toxic substances, leading to a slippery and vacuous uterus, resulting in abnormal menstrual flow. If not treated promptly, the stagnated blood can harm the heart, jeopardizing both mother and child, and may lead to gradual drying of the fetus, bringing imminent danger.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>A question was asked: What does it mean when a pregnant woman has a red face, bitter mouth, dry tongue, restless heart, and abdominal distension? The answer is: This is due to indulging excessively in drinking alcohol and consuming peaches, pears, plums, sheep, chicken, wheat, and fish, which are harmful substances that cause soreness in the joints and constipation. One may take Gui Liang Jie Ming San.</p>
<p>A question was asked: What does it mean when there is coldness in the fetus, abdominal distension, weakness and pain, a cold sensation and desire to relieve oneself below the navel, frequent urination, and loose stools? The answer is: When the fetus’s energy is complete and the flesh is formed, it could be due to eating sweet and cold fruits, being in a draught, or receiving unseasonable air, which causes the fetus to be cold, making it unable to find comfort; the skin aches, the muscles and bones are tense, and the hands and feet may cramp. This could cause danger to the mother, so one should urgently take An Tai He Qi San.</p>
<p>A question was asked: What does it mean when a pregnant woman experiences palpitations, frequent disturbances in sleep, swelling in both sides, abdominal fullness, urgent pain around the navel, and restlessness sitting or lying down, with breathlessness causing fetal agitation? The answer is: When the energy of the fetus is formed and the five organs are nourished, this is due to stagnant energy, which might arise from loud noises, causing the heart to race and leading to fetal agitation, pain in the muscles and bones, and restlessness in the limbs. One should urgently boil Da Sheng San to stabilize the pregnancy and avoid danger.</p>
<p>A question was asked: What does it mean when a pregnancy has not reached half the term and results in a premature birth? The answer is: This is mainly because of the weakness of the organs, with deficient energy and blood.

<p>Question: What should we do about small, dribbling urination during pregnancy?<br>Answer: This is generally caused by improper regulation; the fetal organs’ energy is weak, likely due to excessive drinking and indulgence, which harms the blood and energy, leading to water retention and dribbling urination, termed &quot;fetal dribbling.&quot; One should take Anrong Powder to promote smooth urination.</p>
<p>Question: What about experiencing red and white diarrhea during pregnancy?<br>Answer: This is usually due to cold foods harming the spleen, acrid and sour flavors damaging the stomach, and imbalances of hot and cold leading to fetal instability, causing stagnation of energy and blood, resulting in frequent diarrhea, sometimes red, sometimes white, accompanied by abdominal rumbling and heaviness, as well as pain during passage. One should urgently take Mengjiang Huanglian Pills, regardless of whether it is due to heat or cold symptoms—both can be addressed. For abdominal pain and urgent fullness due to diarrhea, one should use Danggui Shaoyao Decoction.</p>
<p>Question: What if there is an external invasion of wind and cold during pregnancy, accompanied by general heat and dizziness?<br>Answer: This typically arises from wind and cold affecting the skin, damaging the protective and nutritive levels, possibly after washing the neck and back or exposing oneself to wind for cooling, which can lead to headache, aversion to cold, fever, and even chest discomfort. In such cases, since both the life of the mother and child are at stake before childbirth, one should not rashly take medicinal soups.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>At the onset of a cold, it is advisable to take Xiangsu Powder to expel the wind and resolve the exterior evil, allowing the illness to heal on its own. </p>
<p>Question: What about pregnant women suffering from malaria?<br>Answer: This is due to the weakness of the nourishing and protective Qi, insufficient spleen and stomach, possibly caused by wind and cold or injury from consuming raw or cold foods, leading to the development of malaria. It is urgent to take an expelling evil powder. Do not wait for vomiting and reversal of thoughts, as it will be difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Question: What of pregnancy complicated by wheezing and acute pain and fullness in the sides?<br>Answer: This is likely due to the dysfunction of the five organs, deficiency in Qi and blood, resulting from consuming raw or cold foods, or experiencing heat with aversion to cold, bluish lips and pale face, muscle and tendon cramps, joint soreness, dry skin, wheezing, constipation, and frequent vomiting. Ping&#39;an Powder is the primary treatment for this.</p>
<p>Question: What about dizziness and impaired vision during pregnancy, accompanied by swollen lymph nodes in the jaw and neck?<br>Answer: This is likely caused by harm to the liver from fetal Qi, heat toxicity ascending, resulting in pain at the temples, vomiting, and stiffness in the shoulders and neck, which causes visual disturbances. If accompanied by phlegm obstruction, it may become critical. Urgently decoct and administer Xiaofeng Powder to dissipate it.</p>
<p>Question: What of a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen?<br>Answer: This may be due to hard food harming the fetus. Once the fetus is affected, it degenerates into spleen and stomach deficiency, leading to cold pressing on the lower abdomen, resembling a &quot;turbulent surge.&quot; There may also be heaviness in the waist, constipation, and noise from the sides.

<p>When a woman is pregnant for nine months and becomes mute, it is due to the disruption of the connecting vessels of the fetus. Therefore, it is said in the classics that this is without cure. However, although this statement exists, it is better to prepare two taels of roasted jade candle powder, simmer it with half a bowl of water until reduced to seven parts, strain it, add a little honey, and let it cool before sipping it occasionally. This will cause the lung fire to descend, clear the lung metal naturally, and restore the voice, as the lungs govern sound.</p>
<p><strong>On the Discussion of the Decoction for Returning to Health</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant, it hinders the spleen, leading to slow transformation and the generation of dampness, which in turn creates heat. The ancients used Atractylodes and Scutellaria as the sacred medicine for ensuring safe pregnancy, as Atractylodes strengthens the spleen and dries dampness while Scutellaria clears heat. Moreover, pregnancy relies on the nourishment of blood. This formula includes Angelica Sinensis, Ligusticum, and Peony, which are particularly effective in nourishing blood. Taking this medicine will facilitate childbirth, producing healthy children free from fetal toxins, and there will be fewer occurrences of smallpox and measles, leading to easier upbringing, with intelligence and wisdom emerging naturally without need for words. This has been repeatedly tested and verified.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p>
<h3>Regulation Method</h3>
<p>For pregnancy regulation, using a mixture of the four substances plus rehydrated dandelion, white atractylodes, and yellow gentian, ground into powder and taken regularly is quite effective. Before childbirth, one should clear heat and nourish the blood. </p>
<p>If the pregnant woman has her energy disturbed by heat, leading to upward issues like rapid breathing, immediately use a powdered combination of yellow gentian and cyperus. Miscarriage is due to qi deficiency and blood heat; yellow gentian stabilizes the pregnancy, as it works in the upper and middle jiao to lower fire and facilitate downward movement. </p>
<p>Motherwort, also known as leonurus, treats various diseases before and after childbirth, promoting blood circulation and nourishing the blood. For difficult labor, it can be made into a paste. Both rehmannia paste and ox knee paste can be used. </p>
<p>The cravings during pregnancy indicate a deficiency in a specific organ; for instance, if the liver is weak, then liver qi can only conceive. Furthermore, if you cannot nourish the liver, the deficiency will lead to a craving for sour substances. </p>
<p>Before childbirth, white atractylodes and yellow gentian are excellent medicines for stabilizing the pregnancy. Cyperus is also a sacred medicine for ensuring a safe pregnancy. Common people do not understand this and mistakenly believe that cold substances should be avoided, thinking that warm medicines can nourish the fetus. They fail to realize that it&#39;s essential to clear heat beforehand so that the blood flows properly without causing disturbances, thus nurturing the fetus.</p>
<p>As the due date approaches, use a combination of three tonics with roasted cyperus and roasted white peony made into pills.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>To alleviate heat, use the San Bu Pill and the Di Huang Ointment. For pregnancies of eight or nine months, it is essential to regulate the Qi, using zhi ke (bitter orange) and zi su (perilla stem). Prenatal diseases and spasms often arise from wind, cold, and dampness invading the weak, all treated through the Tai Yang channel. The heavenly force continues without pause, giving rise to life endlessly. Chuang wei zi (motherwort seed) invigorates the blood and moves Qi, possessing unique qualities for nourishing Yin, hence named &quot;Yi Mu&quot; as it harmonizes and also provides nourishment. Thus, it is said that there should be no stagnation before birth, and no deficiency after delivery. For calming the fetus, use Huang Qin (scutellaria), ensuring to select solid and submerged pieces in water as the best choice. For vaginal bleeding due to Qi deficiency and heat, use the Si Wu Decoction with added ejiao beads, bai zhu, tian qin (scutellaria), xiang fu (Cyperus), and sha ren (amomum), with glutinous rice boiled in plain water for consumption. Pregnant women may also experience Qi obstructing the water pathways, leading to swelling; this can be remedied by regulating Qi and calming the spleen, with no obstruction to diet, and swelling will naturally dissipate after delivery. For all prenatal ailments in women, primarily use the Si Wu Decoction, adjusting according to the symptoms.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>If you feel discomfort in your abdomen, have a bitter mouth, and lack appetite, regardless of how many months have passed, take the following formula with added white atractylodes, scutellaria, and cardamom decocted for consumption. If after five to six months the fetal movements are restless or pushing against your heart, add donkey hide gelatin, mugwort leaves, cardamom, bitter orange peel, scutellaria, white atractylodes, and wild ramie root, all decocted together. If you experience anxiety caused by qi and blood deficiency, with a weak and large pulse, or have palpitations and trembling hands, along with mild heat, add ginseng, white atractylodes, scutellaria, licorice, sour jujube seed, polygala, ophiopogon, and angelica dogwood to the formula. If you have unexplained bleeding before five to six months, or bleeding due to some incident, add scutellaria, white atractylodes, licorice, white angelica, reed root, ground wood, and mulberry parasitic herbs. If between seven to eight months, there is swelling in the face, ears, and limbs, add poria, alisma, white atractylodes, scutellaria, fried gardenia, magnolia bark, licorice, and ophiopogon among other herbs.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>If a pregnant woman suddenly experiences spasms, foaming at the mouth, and loses consciousness, speaking incoherent words, she should be treated with the Erchen Decoction modified with Mai Dong, Zhu Ru, Yuan Zhi, and Shi Chang Pu. If she has a cold with symptoms like headache, fever, or body aches, the Xiao Chai Hu Decoction should be used, possibly adding Xiao Xin, Bai Zhi, Fang Feng, and Qiang Huo. If she experiences vomiting and nausea for two to three months, with a loss of appetite, it is termed &quot;evil obstruction,&quot; and the formula should remove Di Huang, adding Chen Pi, Ban Xia, Sha Ren, Shen Qu, Huo Xiang, Mai Ya, Cang Zhu, and Bai Zhu. If there is restlessness due to a disturbed fetus from external stress, with bleeding indicating a miscarriage, the formula should add Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Bai Fu Ling, Qiong, Bai Zhi, Sang JI Sheng, Sha Ren, E Jiao Zhu, and Gan Cao. If there is frequent white discharge, the formula should include Bai Fu Ling, Chen Pi, Cang Zhu, Ban Xia, Shen Qu, Mu Li, and Long Gu. If there is unexplained abdominal pain with watery diarrhea, or fever with fetal movement being unsettled, the formula should have added Bai Zhu, Fu Ling, Zhu Ling, Ze Xie, Cang Zhu, He Zi, Chen Pi, Sha Ren, Shen Qu, and Gan Jiang. During pregnancy, the pulse is typically strong and rapid; if the pulse is thin and weak, it indicates a fatal condition for the fetus.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>A Discussion on Establishing Principles</strong> 【Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng】</p>
<p><strong>Fetal Loss</strong></p>
<p>The male principle exerts influence while the female principle transforms, thus conception is achieved. If there is a deficiency in blood and energy, it fails to nourish, and the fetus will consequently be lost. Sometimes, if there is excessive labor or emotional distress, internal heat will be stirred, which can also lead to fetal loss. Tracing the root cause, it is all due to heat that can consume substances, and thus, the natural order. <em>The Source of Illness</em> states that cold winds harm the fetal organs leading to loss, but this does not reflect the true state of disease. I have observed that women from the Jia family, who are pregnant for around three months, often experience loss. When examining their pulses, the left hand feels large yet weak, and upon pressing more firmly, it shows signs of deficiency, as if there is little blood. Considering their youthful age, it&#39;s best to tonify the central energy to nourish the blood naturally. It was the beginning of summer, so I advised them to take a strong decoction of white atractylodes with a grams of dried scarlet sage, taking three to forty doses, which succeeded in preserving the pregnancy. Thus, reflecting on this, it seems that the cause of loss due to internal heat and deficiency is quite often the case. Whether it is heat or deficiency, one must discern their severity—a skilled practitioner must take this seriously and not underestimate it.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Zhuanbao (Transfusion)</strong></p>
<p>Transfusion illness occurs in pregnant women with a weak constitution, those who are often anxious, quick-tempered, and with a preference for rich foods. Generally, these patients present with such characteristics. Ancient methods commonly employed smooth and laxative medicines, but these seldom yielded results. It was thought that the fetus, when improperly positioned, caused a blockage in the womb.</p>
<p>If the fetus were raised up properly in the center, the connection would be clear, and the fluid would flow naturally. However, if the fetus is positioned lower, there must be a reason for this. </p>
<p>One day, a favored concubine of the Wu household suffered from this condition. The pulse in both hands felt thin, but on further examination, the left hand was slightly more balanced. I said: This is due to worry and distress. The thin pulse indicates a lack of blood and an excess of qi, while the tight pulse suggests fluid retention. With insufficient blood, the womb weakens and cannot support itself; the excess qi and unclear central qi lead to overflow, causing the fetus to descend.</p>
<p>I then prescribed a modified version of the Four Substance Decoction, adding ginseng, atractylodes, pinellia, aged tangerine peel, fresh licorice, and fresh ginger, to be taken on an empty stomach. I instructed to probe the throat to induce vomiting of the medicinal fluid, waiting briefly until the qi was restored, and then to administer another dose; this continued for several days. Following this method over eight doses brought relief.</p>
<p>Though this approach lacks certainty, it may be coincidental. I later used it on several other patients with similar effectiveness, but the true results remain unclear. </p>
<p>Zhongjing states that healthy women usually feel full and robust, while those who are thin may feel empty and depleted; a blockage in the womb also causes the fetus to descend. The meaning of this is not thoroughly explained, and surely there are those who can understand it better.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br><strong>Medical Compendium of the Original Commander by Wang Haizang</strong></p>

<p><strong>Essential Points of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy</strong>  </p>
<p>Nausea and vomiting before delivery are characterized by eating and then vomiting, a craving for sour foods, and a tendency to lie down rather than be active. It is commonly referred to as the illness of the child. This condition arises from a pre-existing phlegm and fluid accumulation, with blood stagnation leading to obstruction. Hence, the intake of food rises and stagnates in the liver meridian, where the liver&#39;s flavor is sour, resulting in a preference for sour foods. Metal overcomes wood; therefore, one can counter this with a small Banxia and Fuling decoction, and for more severe cases, use the Erchen decoction. If there is vomiting and inability to eat, with a feeling of heart deficiency and irritability, one should consider using Juzi Su drink with a piece of bamboo shavings. If hot medicines have been taken, causing discomfort and heat in the diaphragm, use Puhuang powder or He Ye powder.  </p>
<p><strong>Transverse Uterus and Distinction from Other Conditions</strong>  </p>
<p>The concept of a transverse uterus is acknowledged in various discussions. As the fetus grows and presses downward towards the uterus, the uterus is compressed and tilted, leading to frequent urination and the phenomenon of “leakage.&quot; The uterus is referred to as the bladder. However, child blockage shares similarities with a transverse uterus, but frequent urination with dripping pain characterizes child blockage, whereas frequent and lesser urine output without pain signifies a transverse uterus. If there is slight pain, it ultimately confirms it is distinct from blockage. One should also use Shengliao Wuling powder with a penny&#39;s worth of ejiao. Various additional formulations for pre-delivery conditions include Wuweizi and Bawei pills compounded with Angelica. One may also consider adding Plantago seeds. The Fahui decoction is particularly effective.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Care and Management During Premature Birth</strong></p>
<p>Women often experience premature birth around three, five, or seven months. Besides injuries from falls, if a woman has a miscarriage after three months, there is a strong likelihood that she will have another miscarriage at the same time in her next pregnancy. This happens because an injury earlier on creates vulnerability at the subsequent time of delivery. </p>
<p>After a premature birth, it is essential to consume nourishing herbs to bolster Qi and blood and stabilize the fetus. For subsequent pregnancies, starting from two and a half months, one should take about ten doses of herbs to strengthen the fetus and prevent a miscarriage at three months; then, after four and a half months, take another eight to nine doses to guard against miscarrying after five months. This should continue with further doses at six and a half months to prevent a miscarriage at seven months. </p>
<p>By nine months, taking ten doses of Danxi Dasheng Powder ensures a secure pregnancy. For women who have suffered multiple miscarriages, a longer and more active course of treatment is necessary to preserve the fetus. The prescription includes Si Wu Decoction combined with Bai Zhu, Ren Shen, Chen Pi, Fu Ling, Gan Cao, Ejiao, Ai Ye, and Biao Qing, with tonifying agents added if there is deficiency, and ginger and processed Ban Xia for phlegm issues.</p>
<p>Managing pregnancy hinges on clearing heat and nourishing blood, with Huang Qin being a sacred herb for stabilizing the fetus due to its cooling properties. Its use is particularly important in hot months. Fetal nourishment relies heavily on the spleen and stomach; if these are weak, it leads to instability in the pregnancy. Therefore, Bai Zhu is the primary herb for supporting the spleen. If a pregnancy is unsettled due to emotional distress, it is advisable to use Chuan Xiong, Chen Pi, Fu Ling, and Gan Cao, adding more Sha Ren and a little Mu Xiang to help facilitate Qi flow.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Li Chen]</p>
<p><strong>Before Pregnancy: It Is Important to Clear Heat and Nourish Blood</strong></p>
<p>A woman without illness and experiencing her menstrual cycle is capable of conceiving. If her qi and blood are abundant, she can ensure a safe delivery after ten months, with no risk to either mother or child. However, if the channels are insufficiently nourished and conception occurs by chance, the lack of qi and blood will not properly nourish the fetus. It is advisable to take Eight Treasure Decoction in advance to replenish qi and blood as a preventive measure against miscarriage. </p>
<p>If there is pre-existing heat before conception or if heat arises during pregnancy, along with emotional stress or excessive work, the fetus may become unsettled; in severe cases, miscarriages may occur during the third, fifth, or seventh months. Fire can consume life, so it is prudent to consistently take An Tai Wan to clear excess heat. When the heat is resolved, the blood will flow properly without disruption, thus nourishing the fetus. A saying goes: &quot;It is not advisable to have heat before conception, and there is good reason for this!&quot;<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Monthly Regulation According to the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>If the energy and blood in the meridians are unbalanced, the pregnancy will be unstable. It is vital to regulate according to the meridians each month to avoid miscarriage, and intercourse between male and female is strictly forbidden.</p>
<p><strong>Monthly Pulse Dominance in Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>When a woman conceives, the mother’s blood room opens, and the father’s essence arrives at the right moment. The yin curtain gathers, resembling a bundle of cloth being tied. The essence and blood, propelled by the vital energy, naturally rotate endlessly, akin to a dung beetle rolling and consuming its waste, resulting in conception, forming a rounded orb, akin to the celestial sphere. After nine days, this process continues without pause until yin and yang stabilize, with the original yellow nourishing each other. Externally it resembles intertwined agate, while internally it forms an orifice, hollow and circular, akin to the egg yolk containing a small cavity. The energy outside solidifies into the embryonic membranes, initially thin and gradually thickening, similar to the thin skin that forms on the surface of a mixture of rice drink and soybean milk. Inside, the orifice grows daily, from nonexistence to existence. The essence and blood transform daily, moving from existence to nonexistence. After nine days, another nine days, totaling twenty-seven days, one month is completed, and the orifice naturally condenses into a small entity, much like a dewdrop. This signifies the movement of the ultimate principle giving rise to yang, where &quot;Heaven One produces Water,&quot; referred to as the embryo, primarily governed by the foot jueyin meridian. During this month, the menses are closed without flow or pain; dietary habits should slightly differ from usual, and one must not offend or hastily take medicine.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>On the twenty-seventh day of the ninth period, which is also the number for February, the dew drops change to a red color like peach petals. This signifies that the Tai Chi stills and produces Yin, and the Earth gives birth to Fire, known as &quot;Yang.&quot; It is governed by the lesser Yang meridian. During this month, the abdomen may experience movement or stillness, evoking some uncertainty; there may also be sensations of nausea and sourness, termed &quot;bad obstruction,&quot; indicating a confirmed pregnancy. There might be particular cravings, hinting at a deficiency in a specific organ. For instance, a craving for sour foods suggests that the liver can only nourish the fetus but is itself deficient. If there are sudden abdominal pains or discomfort within two to three months, one should take three qian of Angelica, three qian of donkey-hide gelatin, three qian of licorice, and four stalks of scallion, decocted for consumption.</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh day of the ninth period, this corresponds to the numbers for March. Within a hundred days, the form of the fetus begins to distinguish between male and female, resembling the white fluff in clear mucus. The adult shape begins to appear, with male and female parts clearly defined. All parts can be faintly discerned, and this is referred to as the &quot;fetus.&quot; The active development of the fetus is guided by the Yang pathway of the Tai Chi for males and the Kun pathway for females, with the hands governed by the Shao Yin meridian&#39;s Fire. The fetus is most likely to show movement; the ancient Qian Zhi Tang or frequent consumption of pills is most effective.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>If there are no adverse signs or evidence, and if there are suspicions about the fetus, use the method of examination with one qian of Chuanxiong ground into powder, mixed with mugwort soup at dawn. If after taking it, there is no sensation of movement in the abdomen, it indicates a menstrual issue; if there is slight movement, it indicates pregnancy. If due to fright or anxiety the fetal energy is not in harmony and movement is difficult, causing pain in the abdomen and the navel, take two qian of warm wine and mix it with additional Angelica, which is especially clever. If the fetus is restless and there is unbearable pain in the lower back, use the ancient Du Xu Wan.</p>
<p>In the fourth month, when the gender is differentiated, the fetus begins to receive the essence of water to form blood vessels, and the shape is complete, the six organs develop in order, under the management of the Shao Yang channel. If there is a distended feeling in the abdomen, making it hard to digest food, a more severe condition can be treated with Ping Wei San, replacing Bai Zhu with Xiang Fu, Wu Yao, and Da Fu Pi. If due to fright or anger the fetus drops, causing pain in the lower abdomen extending to the waist and flank, with painful urination and blood, use the An Tai Dang Gui Tang.</p>
<p>In the fourth or fifth month, if there is sudden pain in the abdomen, use fourteen roasted black jujubes and one qian of salt burned red to powder, take a pinch, and mix it with wine to take for immediate relief.</p>
<p>In the fifth month, the fetus begins to receive the essence of fire to generate the yin-yang energy; the muscles and bones, as well as limbs, are formed, and hair begins to grow, governed by the Tai Yin channel.</p>
<p>In the sixth month, the fetus begins to receive the essence of metal to form muscles.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>All orifices are formed, and the foot Yangming channel is responsible. For those whose fetus is unstable in May and June, use the An胎 drink and Gu胎 drink. In July, the essence of wood begins to form bones; the skin and hair are already formed. If the spirit wanders, it can move the left hand, governed by the hand Taiyin channel. If the fetal qi is unsettled, it is called a blockage disease; thus, use the Xuanfu flower powder.</p>
<p>In August, the essence of earth begins to form the skin, the body gradually grows, and all nine orifices are complete. The wandering spirit can move the right hand, governed by the hand Yangming channel. If the fetus is unstable, lightly fry sand ginger into a powder and take it with rice water; it alleviates pain and moves qi quickly, but should not be taken excessively before the eighth or ninth month. If the fetus is large, use the Shutaiban pill.</p>
<p>In September, the essence of stone begins to form skin and hair; all joints are complete. The body can turn three times, governed by the foot Shaoyin channel. </p>
<p>In October, qi becomes abundant, the five organs and six limbs are all interconnected, taking in the qi of heaven and earth into the dantian, thus all joints, spirit, and body are complete, overseen by the foot Taiyang channel. Only the hand Shaoyin and Taiyang channels do not have a specific master, as the ruler&#39;s office is accomplished without effort. For difficult births in these two months, use Da Sheng powder; for excessively large or overly nourished and complacent cases, use Zhiqiao powder; for those inherently weak, use Yimother&#39;s Lifesaving powder.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br><strong>Nausea and Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes there is severe vomiting, or at times, vomiting clear water. There is a strong aversion to food smells, due to the channels of the uterus connecting to the stomach. Thus, when food odor stimulates the vital energy, it rises. One must vomit the food completely for the vital energy to settle. There are also cases where the uterus is excessively dampened after intercourse, and this can resolve after more than a hundred days. </p>
<p>Treatment methods: If there is a lot of phlegm, use the Erchen Decoction with added bamboo shavings, ginger, and hot herbs like qin and lian. If vomiting occurs without an apparent cause, the left pulse is likely weak, and there may be headaches, with no food being taken; use the Eight-Specifics Decoction combined with Erchen Decoction plus roots and stems. For weakness of vitality, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with added tangerine peel, mai men dong, hou po, and bamboo shavings. If there is a prolonged inability to ingest food and the person is vomiting clear water, add cloves. </p>
<p>If there is an aversion to food smells and the patient sleeps a lot and moves little, use xuan fu hua powder. For those suffering from nausea and vomiting for three to four months, especially with restless fetal movement or accompanying waist and abdomen pain, use a miscarriage-preserving drink. If there is also symptoms of malaria or dysentery with a loss of taste in the mouth, or a history of catching a cold, use the wake spleen drink. If there is injury from food, use Erchen Decoction with added sand ginger and xiang fu, or simply use white atractylodes in pill form, or sand ginger in powdered form, taken with rice drink; in severe cases, red pills are highly effective.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p>
<h3>Child Disturbance</h3>
<p>Anxiety and restlessness during pregnancy, referred to as &quot;child disturbance.&quot; This often occurs between the fourth and fifth months of pregnancy when the maternal fire is active, or it may coincide with the heavenly decree in the months of May and June, when the ruling fire is strong. Both can affect the lungs, leading to restlessness and unsettled fetal movements. Generally, if the maternal fire is excessive, one should focus on the mother; take honey pills made with fox nuts, three pills with wine. For those who are not yet fully term and desire to give birth or experience difficulties in childbirth, this remedy is also effective. If the ruling fire is strong, use only Huanglian pills. For those whose spirits are unsettled, use Zhushā Anshen pills. If anxiety is severe and poses a risk to the fetus, employ the Zhaotai powder; it must not be treated with weak anxiety remedies. If there is phlegm or stagnant fluids trapped in the chest area causing restlessness and fetal movement issues, use a mixture of Poria, Fangfeng, and Mai Men Dong, adding a portion of Huangqin, with bamboo leaves reduced by half, boiled in water, and taken with bamboo juice.</p>
<h3>Child Suspended</h3>
<p>From the fourth to the fifth month of pregnancy, the nurturing fire affects the fetus, causing the fetal heat to rise and create fullness and pain in the chest and stomach, labeled as &quot;child suspended.&quot; This requires a Zisu drink. If there is significant chest fullness and distress, add a small amount of Curcuma and Clove. For those unable to eat, use the ancient Qinfang Decoction, which doubles the Bai Zhu and adds Chuanxiong. If the fire becomes excessively intense all at once, leading to extreme chest oppression and death, the Zisu drink should be continuously administered as a remedy. If there is accidental consumption of abortifacient drugs causing the fetus to die in utero, the ancient Qionguit Decoction can save the situation. </p>
<h3>Febrile Illness<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></h3>
<p>Prenatal care primarily focuses on stabilizing the fetus, adhering to ancient methods that avoid disturbing the stomach and the upper jiao. Disturbing the stomach refers to purging, affecting the upper jiao refers to inducing sweating, and disturbing the middle jiao refers to inducing vomiting. Sweating, vomiting, and purging should be avoided; instead, harmony and resolution are essential. The prenatal pill must include Bai Zhu and Huang Qin as the main ingredients for stabilizing the fetus. For common exterior pathogens, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction minus Ban Xia, adding Bai Zhu to combine with Si Wu Decoction, or with Si Jun Zi Decoction, as these best preserve the fetus and eliminate heat. For signs of cold damage, with Tai Yang syndrome, use Jiu Wei Qiang Huo Decoction combined with Si Wu Decoction; for Yang Ming syndrome, use Sheng Ma Ge Gen Decoction; for Shao Yang syndrome, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction; for Tai Yin syndrome, use Ping Wei San plus Bai Zhu and Zhi Shi; for heat, use Da Chai Hu Decoction plus Hou Pao and Dang Gui. For Shao Yin syndrome, use Ren Shen San Bai Decoction plus Dang Gui; for heat, use Liang Ge San. For Jue Yin syndrome, use Li Zhong Tang; for heat, use Liu Yi Shun Qi Decoction. All of the above should be taken with Si Wu Decoction. The remaining variations follow ancient methods. For exterior symptoms, use Xiong Su San, Gu Qiang Zhu Decoction, Qian Hu Qi Wu Decoction, or Huang Long Decoction. For summer heat damages, use Chai Hu Shi Gao Decoction. For vomiting, nausea, and fetal movement issues, use Mai Men Dong Decoction. For vomiting, loss of appetite, and irritability, use Lu Gen Decoction. For fever and irritability, use Sheng Ge Gen alone, decocted with water. For rashes, use Zhi Zi Da Qing Decoction or Sheng Ma Liu Wu Decoction. For mania, use Qin Jiao San. If there are fears of miscarriage due to extreme heat, apply Fuzhong Gan powder mixed with water to the navel and reapply when dry, stopping once the illness resolves. If the fetus has died, use Cong Chi Decoction or a decoction made with only scallions.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Movement</strong></p>
<p>Fetal movement may occur due to the seven emotions causing qi stagnation, leading to abdominal distension and pain; in such cases, use purple perilla decoction. If it results from external factors causing fever, headache, nausea, and fullness in the chest and sides, take the An Tai decoction with added Chai Hu and Da Fu Pi. For qi and blood deficiency, double the amount of Ren Shen and Bai Zhu in the An Tai decoction. If there is heat, use the Gu Tai decoction. If there is bleeding during fetal movement, use the Jiao Ai Xiong Gui decoction, or add Sha Ren, Qin Jiao, Juan Bai, Sang Qiao Xiao, Sang Ji Sheng, and Du Zhong. For unbearable abdominal pain with bleeding, or when the blood resembles yellow liquid or bean juice, take five qian each of wild ramie root and honeysuckle root, boiled in half a cup each of water and wine. If there is bleeding at the birth canal with pain, take one qian of single Huang Lian mixed with wine. </p>
<p>If a pregnant woman falls from a height or is pressed by a heavy object, leading to agitation of the fetal energy and severe abdominal pain with bleeding, use slightly fried Sha Ren (avoid burning), powdered, and mix it with hot wine, salt water, or ai herb soup for consumption. If heat is felt in the abdomen, the fetus will be stable.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>The fetus is treated by various methods, with efficacy similar to that of rhubarb and atractylodes. For excessive bleeding, use Gu Xiong Gui Decoction with gelatin and mugwort. For fetal movement with abdominal pain, if taking 安贻药 does not provide relief, one must differentiate between cold and heat, deficiency and excess. For cold cases, use Li Zhong Decoction with cardamom and cyperus; for heat, Huang Qin Decoction. In cases of blood deficiency causing fetal pain, use Si Wu Decoction, or Ping Wei San with Su salt decoction, and swallow Er Yi pills. If there is pain from qi deficiency, use Si Jun Zi Decoction with peony and angelica. For pain due to qi excess and abdominal distension, use powdered cyperus and bitter orange in equal parts, taken with plain water on an empty stomach. </p>
<p>For fetal movement accompanied by heart pain due to cold, use mugwort leaves and fennel; equal parts of Sichuan chinaberry, boiled with water on an empty stomach, or use guo cardamom pills. For heat, use Er Chen Decoction excluding banxia, adding gardenia and Huang Qin. </p>
<p>In cases of fetal movement with abdominal pain, especially with a history of cold sensations, and the pain stabbing the heart as if with a knife, use Si Wu Decoction excluding rehmannia, adding Poria, magnolia, ginseng, wuzhuyu, platycodon, bitter orange, and licorice, to decoct and take.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>For severe abdominal pain with distress, use a decoction of Radix Notopterygii with Poria and Magnolia in equal parts, boiled in water and taken orally. Alternatively, for a single remedy, use carp as food, add fourteen dates, a small amount of salt, and a little wine; boil and drink the juice. If you do not drink wine, use carp combined with glutinous rice, ginger, and scallions to make congee, and consume it every ten days, which is very effective for protecting and promoting fetal growth.</p>
<p>For fetal movement accompanied by waist pain, this is most urgent. If it is sour and painful, it is a sign that labor is imminent. For emotional distress, use a drink made from perilla leaf, with additions of Eucommia and Duzhong. If there is acute pain, use two qian of broken old paper and one walnut, ground together, and take with clear wine. For chronic dull pain, use Qing&#39;e pills. For severe waist pain that feels like it is about to break and makes it impossible to turn, use five qian of antler, fire-roasted and soaked in wine, then re-roasted and crushed to a fine powder, to be taken with wine.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>To treat fetal movement, it is commonly effective to use a decoction of Ancient Qinqi and Aojiao. For wind evil, add fresh ginger and fermented soybeans; for cold, add scallions or a small amount of dry ginger; for heat, add tianhuafen; for both cold and heat, add Chaihu; for a stiff neck, add scallions; for warm abdominal pain, add white peony; for abdominal distension, add thick bark; for lower blood, add mugwort and ground earth; for lower back pain, add duzhong; for fright and palpitations, use Huanglian; for excessive thirst, add Mai Men Dong and black plum; for excessive contemplation, use Fuzhen; for phlegm and vomiting, add Xuanfu Hua and Banxia Qu; for laborious tasks, add Huangqi; for breathlessness without Baizhu, add Xiangfu; for dry stools, add hemp seed; for habitual difficult delivery, add Zhiqiao and Suye; for habitual miscarriage, use Duzhong; for habitual blood deficiency, add Xiong and Gui. This is the sacred medicine for maintaining pregnancy. In cases of sudden discharge, take three to five doses in one day; in cases of gradual discharge, take one dose every five to ten days. Regular use helps maintain pregnancy and leads to easier delivery, with the offspring free of fetal toxins. This is because pregnancy with sluggish spleen and earth transformation leads to dampness, which further causes heat. Thus, Huangqin is used to clear heat and nourish blood, while Baizhu strengthens the spleen to dry dampness. Jin Gui Danggui San and Jia Wei Yang Rong Wan can all be derived from this formula.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Leakage</strong></p>
<p>Pain in the heart and abdomen with blood flow is considered fetal movement; blood flow without pain is considered fetal leakage. If the condition is hot, the blood flow will be abundant: if there is internal heat causing thirst, one should use Si Wu Decoction with additional Bai Zhu, Qin, Lian, and Yi Mu Cao, or Jin Gui&#39;s Dang Gui Powder, or modified Yang Rong Pill. If the blood is black and in chunks, use San Bu Wan with Xiang Fu and Bai Shao. If blood is deficient and comes in small amounts, use Gu Jiao Ai Tang or combine with Si Wu Decoction or Chang Tai Bai Zhu Wan. For Qi deficiency, employ Si Jun Zi Tang with additional Huang Qin and E Jiao; if labor and cold have led to Qi deficiency leading to blood flow and the sensation of falling, use Xiong Gui Bu Zhong Decoction. In some cases, if the blood flows like menstrual discharge causing damage to both fetus and mother, use Shou Di and fried Gan Jiang, each two qian, ground into powder and mixed with rice wine for consumption. There are also cases of women with a rich body, expecting menstrual flow, or who might be affected by a sudden cold when using the toilet. Even without medication, they may remain unharmed. However, treating fetal leakage immediately with harsh medicine may result in miscarriage. Only those who experience blood flow due to intercourse are genuinely experiencing fetal leakage; in such instances, use Ba Wu Decoction with added Jiao Ai for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Urinary Blood</strong></p>
<p>Fetal leakage occurs with blood flow from the human door; urinary blood occurs with blood flow from the urinary door. During pregnancy, urinary blood is often due to heat in the womb. Use Si Wu Decoction with additional Shan Zhi and burnt ash, or a drink made with bitter dandelion is also effective. If it is due to heat from summer, use Yi Yuan San with Sheng Ma decoction. For slight deficiency, use Jiao Ai Si Wu Decoction. For a prolonged condition, use Long Gu (one qian) and Pu Huang (five qian) ground into powder and mixed with wine for consumption.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br><strong>Zi Lin</strong></p>
<p>During pregnancy, dietary excess can cause heat accumulation in the bladder, leading to urinary retention, also known as &quot;zi lou&quot; (child leakage). This should be treated with Guo Qiong Gui Decoction plus Mu Tong, Mai Men Dong, Ren Shen, Gan Cao, and Deng Xin. In the final month, add Hua Shi (Talc) as the principal ingredient. For severe heat, use Wu Ling San. The cause is often internal injury from excessive sexual activity, resulting in weakness at the gate of the uterus. For deficiency cases, use Si Wu Tang combined with Liu Jun Zi Tang or Shen Qi Wan.</p>
<p><strong>Zhuan Bao</strong></p>
<p>During pregnancy, the bladder is pressed by the fetus, causing it to shift to one side, leading to obstruction of urinary pathways. Those with a weaker constitution, who are irritable and have a thick flavor, often experience this. The treatment is to elevate the fetus, allowing the bladder to open its waterway naturally. Use Si Wu Tang combined with Liu Jun Zi Tang, removing Fu Ling, and probe to lift the position; avoid the use of diuretics. Those with a history of being stout but suddenly losing weight, along with a pulse that is weak and weak on both sides, indicate Yang deficiency, treated with Shen Qi Wan. In severe cases, use Dong Kui Zi, Chi Fu Ling, and Chi Shao, decocted in water with a little burnt ash added. If there’s heat, use Guo Qian Zhu Decoction combined with Yi Yuan San.</p>
<p><strong>Yi Niao</strong></p>
<p>During pregnancy, pressure on the bladder can cause urgency to urinate. The classic remedy involves using Bai Wei and Bai Shao in equal parts, ground into powder, and taken with wine every three coins (around the weight measure). However, both deficiency and heat can be present. If the urine is red, it indicates heat, treated with Guo Qian Zhu Decoction, adding a little Shan Zhu Yu and Wu Wei Zi. If the urine is clear, it indicates deficiency, treated with An Tai Yin or Ji (Jiao) Yan San.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br><strong>Edema</strong></p>
<p>If the edema has lasted for five or six months, it is advisable to use Wupisan with an increased amount of Bai Zhu as the main ingredient. For those with shortness of breath and difficulty urinating, use Fangji San. If there is excessive damp-heat, grind Shan Zhi into powder and mix it with rice wine for consumption; alternatively, you may use Shan Zhi pills. In pregnancy, from seven to eight months onward, if there is swelling in both legs, for severe cases use Pingwei San plus Mu Guo. If there is an external infection, use Bingsu San. For swelling in the legs and waist, use Shenzhang Tang. For swelling in the hands and feet, use red beans and Sang Ba Pi in equal parts, prepared as a decoction. For serious cases, add Shang Lu.</p>
<p><strong>Stroke</strong></p>
<p>When the body is weak, subjected to wind, causing injury to the Taiyang meridian, and then encountering wind and cold together, symptoms may arise such as locked jaw and back stiffness, excessive phlegm and saliva, confusion, and intermittent consciousness, referred to as &quot;ghost symptoms,&quot; also known as &quot;childhood convulsions&quot; or &quot;twitching.&quot; In severe cases, use Xiao Xuming Tang. For severe cases, use Ling Yang Jiao Tang; for lighter cases, use Si Wu Tang with added Ge Gen, Mu Dan Pi, Qin Jiao, Xi Xin, Fang Feng, and Zhu Li; for phlegm, add Bei Mu, Chen Pi, Fu Ling, and Gan Cao, or Gu Xiong Huo San. If the wind-cold invades, causing total body pain, alternating cold and heat, instability of the fetus, persistent headaches, pain around the navel, cold urine that is white like rice-water or greenish-yellow, chills and cold pain in the waist, visual disturbance, use Si Jun Zi Tang omitting Fu Ling, adding Dang Gui, Hou Po, Jiu Bai, and ginger decoction, mixed with wine for consumption. For those unresponsive, use Jing Jie San.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br><strong>Medical Canon: A Treatise on Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Yu Tuan)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>Someone asked: In pregnant women, some have regular menstruation while the fetus continues to grow; while others, after three to five months, experience heavy bleeding but do not miscarry. Some give birth on time, while others only give birth after the due date. What is the reason for this?  </p>
<p>It is said that those who have regular menstruation and whose fetuses continue to grow are referred to as having a &quot;strong fetus.&quot; This is because the woman has abundant blood and energy, which nourishes the fetus, leaving excess blood. For those with a fetus that has existed for months but experiences significant bleeding, it is termed a &quot;leaky fetus.&quot; This occurs due to impacts that disturb the Ren (Conception) vessel, causing bleeding without injuring the uterus.  </p>
<p>However, losing blood during pregnancy, even if the fetus does not miscarry, can deplete its energy and blood, leading to delayed labor. I have seen cases of giving birth after twelve or thirteen months, or even seventeen or eighteen months, or twenty-four or twenty-five months. In these instances, the cause is often insufficient blood and energy, making it difficult for the fetus to grow.  </p>
<p>Generally, if labor does not occur after ten months, one should take strong blood and energy replenishing medicines to nourish the mother, so that delivery may proceed without worry. Students of medicine must not overlook this.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br><strong>Spirit Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: What is a woman with a spirit pregnancy? It was said: What one thinks during the day manifests as visions at night. For those who are lustful and empty, the mutual fires of the liver and kidneys can arise at any time, hence timid individuals often dream of engaging with spirits. What is termed a spirit pregnancy is actually a false pregnancy; it doesn’t result from an actual mingling with spirits. It is said in ancient texts that endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires lead to a state of white lust and murkiness; these flow into the uterus and form a spirit pregnancy. It arises from the woman&#39;s own blood and sexual essence, coalescing into a mass, causing her chest and abdomen to swell as if she were pregnant. What else could it be but a false pregnancy? </p>
<p>Some say: I have read in the medical work of Shi Bo Ren that a woman named Yang Tian Cheng, who was a temple priestess, while wandering the temple at dusk, felt her heart stir upon seeing a yellow-clad deity; that evening, she dreamt of interaction with this deity, and her belly gradually grew as if pregnant. She invited Shi Bo Ren to treat her, and upon diagnosis, he declared: This is a spirit pregnancy. The mother explained how it happened and took medicines for breaking blood to expel the pregnancy, administering about two liters, and was soon at ease. Isn’t this an encounter with a deity? It was replied: Such an incident may occur but follows no logical reasoning. How could physical forms interact and create essence to form a pregnancy? Alas! It is not that the deity deceives the woman, but rather the woman is deceived by the deity. It appears this woman, being older and without a husband, correlates with the idea of endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires. Those learned individuals should not be swayed by the confusion of heretical beliefs!<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Wang Kentang</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Abortion</strong>  </p>
<p>Mr. Yuan states: After conception, the fetus changes every seven days, and these changes are interdependent, each has its growth. Currently, many women have abortions at three months, five months, or seven months, while fewer occur at two, four, or six months. The organs are yin for the viscera and yang for the bowels; three months belong to the heart, five months to the spleen, and seven months to the lungs, all of which are linked to the pulses of the five organs. Yin is often easy to weaken, hence the prevalence of abortions. If in the past there was an abortion at three months, the heart pulse is injured and must be regulated first; otherwise, it may lead to another abortion at three months. If there has been an abortion at five months, the spleen pulse is wounded, and after this, an abortion may occur again at five months, so it is advisable to treat the spleen first. If a miscarriage occurs within one month, the woman may not even be aware of her pregnancy, only that she is not pregnant and does not realize she was pregnant and then lost the fetus. One month pertains to the liver; if anger occurs, it may lead to a miscarriage. Also, frequent washing of the lower body can open the channels and lead to abortion. If there has been one miscarriage, the liver pulse is damaged, and subsequent miscarriages may follow. Nowadays, many childless couples have seen miscarriages at one month; it does not mean they are entirely infertile. Therefore, after the initial intercourse, it is most advisable to rest, avoiding further engagement that may disturb the womb, to avoid anger, exertion, heavy lifting, and bathing. Moreover, one should take herbs that nourish the liver and balance the qi to secure the fetus.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br><strong>On the Division of Forms in Relation to Gender</strong></p>
<p>Cheng Mingqian states: Zhu Cheng remarks that in the union of man and woman, the essence of yin blood arrives first, followed by the yang essence which then leads to the formation of a male; whereas if the yang essence enters first and the blood follows, a female is formed. This statement is indeed credible. There are instances where a person has their essence released first leading to the birth of a male, and released later leading to a female, so why is that? Dongyuan says: If the menstruation has just ceased for one or two days, and the blood sea begins to clear, then a conception will lead to a male; if four or five days later, when the blood vessels are already vigorous, conception will lead to a female. After six or seven days, even if there is a union, it will not lead to conception. This statement is also credible, as there are cases where a person conceives a female shortly after menstruation ceases, and conceives a male after a prolonged interruption.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>There are instances where one has intercourse four or five days prior with no conception, yet experiences conception eight or nine days later; what could be the reason for this? Yu Zi Mu, in his work &quot;Essentials of Conception,&quot; asserts that the strong Yang can enter the receptive Yin, while the strong Yin cannot receive Yang, as explained by the views of the Eastern Garden. He further states that a slight Yang cannot penetrate the Yin, and a weak Yin cannot grasp the Yang. </p>
<p>This is indeed believable; there are men who are frail and women who are timid, often becoming pregnant repeatedly, despite their desires to prevent it, while others, endowed with robust vitality and outstanding essence, struggle significantly to conceive, with no remedy available for them. What could be the reason for this? </p>
<p>Zhu Danxi emphasizes that treatment should focus primarily on a woman&#39;s menstrual cycle. However, in wealthy families with many concubines, surely some of them must have menstruation during the appropriate time? There are also cases where a woman has already borne children frequently with a previous husband, yet marrying another in hopes of ease, but still fails to conceive; instead, she sends the child to another man, hoping for a male heir. Can it be that she cannot conceive with one yet can with another? </p>
<p>I believe that the birth of children from parents is akin to the birth of beings in the universe, as the &quot;I Ching&quot; states, the receptive (Kun) way follows heaven and operates according to the timing.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>The knowledge of the earth&#39;s creation of life is merely a matter of following the will of heaven; thus, a mother giving birth to a child also merely follows the father. If the mother follows the father, regarding the seed, is it primarily valued by women or by men? Indeed, when we speak of value being attributed to men, it does not depend on age, strength, health, or ease of retention. It only requires that when the time of union occurs, the hundred channels are in harmony, which is optimal. When there is harmony in the hundred channels at the time of union, even if one is old or weak, ill or easy to leak, conception can still occur. Conversely, when there is discord in the hundred channels, even if one is young or strong, healthy or difficult to leak, conception becomes challenging. The blood produced by women does derive from the harmonious gathering of the hundred channels; compared to a man&#39;s essence, there is inevitably a distinction in importance.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>Confucius said: Great is the principle of the cosmos, from which all things begin; profound is the principle of the earth, from which all things are born. Is there no intention in this? The distinction between male and female is not restricted by the timing of conception or by the state of the parents, whether the father is strong and the mother weak, or the mother is strong and the father weak. It is determined solely by the proper flow of essence and blood through the hundred channels. Thus, when the essence flows through the channels and overpowers the blood, a male is formed; when the blood flows through the channels and overpowers the essence, a female is formed. Additionally, there are those who conceive but suffer miscarriage, those who give birth yet remain childless, those who nurture yet do not live long, and those who live long but have no offspring. This illustrates the variability of essence and blood in terms of strength and fragility. People in the world do not see how the strength and fragility of essence and blood, which are determined from the very beginning, lead them to wrongly assign blame for miscarriage to the mother, infertility to the son, and mortality to fate. Is this not a mistake?</p>
<p>Regarding weak energy, it is theorized that when energy is deficient, one is weak and may collapse, akin to thick-skinned plants such as magnolia and dried tangerine peel, known as energy-leaking remedies. Is it appropriate to use energy-leaking medicines when energy is lacking? One should instead employ ginseng or atractylodes.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>&quot;The Guide to Childbirth&quot; states: One should not take a miscarriage lightly; the care required is ten times that of a full-term pregnancy. It also mentions that in a partial delivery, the flesh may rot, so one must replenish its deficiencies, promote the growth of flesh, enhance qi and blood, dispel wind and evil, and nourish the vital energy—this care should exceed that of a normal delivery by tenfold; everything will eventually stabilize, and it should be approached with caution!</p>
<p>Regarding abdominal abscess in pregnant women, the treatment is quite different from ordinary methods. One should use a perilla infusion to calm the fetus and refrain from giving other medicines lightly. If it is near term, both the child and pus may be expelled; if it is still some time away, the pus will come from the large intestine; if it is just beginning, medication can help dissipate it; if the abscess is external, the symptoms will definitely be hot. Only central, balancing medications should be used for resolution, and one must carefully consider the severity to avoid mistakes. </p>
<p>Regarding the method to change a girl into a boy, when a couple conceives, the differentiation of yin and yang occurs. If the yang essence prevails, it results in a boy; if the yin blood prevails, it results in a girl; thus they are inherently distinct—how can they be transferred? Although by the third month the male and female forms are differentiated, with the yang essence prevailing for boys and the yin blood for girls, during the first two months the essences are mixed, and the characteristics of male and female have not yet manifested. By the third month, the distinctions of yin and yang begin to become clear, and therefore it is said they are separate. This initial reception of essence determines the outcome; it does not mean that the forms of yin and yang were initially unclear. Ancient practitioners who left this method must have conducted tests; the subtleties of yin and yang transformations are beyond full comprehension.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br><strong>Abortion</strong></p>
<p>Those who suffer from frequent miscarriages during pregnancy are influenced by men’s indulgence and women’s desires, combined with a preference for spicy and hot foods, which damage the body’s balance, leading to the risk of miscarriage. Women who indulge without regard for their condition often have varying degrees of desire. There are some women who appear pregnant but are not; they experience symptoms like phlegm, pain, and fever. If a physician fails to understand the pulse and misapplies depletive and antipyretic remedies, unaware that fetal energy should be nurtured while disease energy should be countered, it would be a grave mistake to use aggressive medications for those who are pregnant. Hence, nourishing the fetus relies on blood, while protecting it depends on vital energy. Some women have too many miscarriages, and upon reaching middle age, they try to find ways to take medications to maintain their pregnancies, yet if their desires do not cease and their temperament remains unchanged, it leads to respiratory issues that harm the body, which may result in death. Therefore, ancient scholars noted that birds incubate eggs, and mammals carry young—if even creatures can protect their progeny, how can humans, as the pinnacle of creation, fail to do so?</p>
<p><strong>Suspension of the Fetus</strong></p>
<p>The five organs are all connected to the heart, and the heart connects back to the five organs. Thus, the gates of the womb connect to the heart. When fetal energy is harmonious, it remains calm and unmoving; when it is not harmonious, it stretches and moves, pulling on its connections, causing heart pain, resembling the condition of something suspended and falling, termed “suspension of the fetus.”</p>
<p><strong>Fetal Distress</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of fetal distress are all related to heat, which can be either deficient or excess. It is necessary to differentiate the twelve meridians to nourish the fetus during the months, treating each according to its organ&#39;s condition. This is a secret passed down in my family and is not documented in various texts.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br><strong>Swelling of the Feet</strong></p>
<p>If a woman’s feet swell after seven or eight months of pregnancy, it cannot be treated, as the swelling will naturally subside after childbirth. If the swelling is severe, it is advisable to use a prescription of Atractylodes, Poria, Stephania, and Pseudocarpium.</p>
<p><strong>Typhoid Fever</strong></p>
<p>When a pregnant woman has typhoid fever, the focus should be on clearing heat and stabilizing the fetus for the sake of life. Treatments such as sweating or purging should align with the pulse and symptoms relating to the five organs without disturbing the fetus. Therefore, for exterior symptoms with sweating, the main prescription should be Xiang Su San; for half exterior and half interior, it should be Huang Long; for interior symptoms, it should be San Huang Jie Du Tang. This is a family secret of mine, and it has helped many people. Even though the ancient formula Liu He Tang has specific guidelines for treatment, it is still not as effective as this.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention of Difficult Labor</strong></p>
<p>Women during pregnancy experience various conditions that differ in richness, labor, joy, and suffering. Is it necessary that everyone faces the misfortune of difficult labor? The discussion of thin fetuses began after Princess Hu Yang, but before that, there were cases of spontaneous birth; was there no way for that? Even today, pregnant women often do not fully rely on medicines seeking for a good delivery. After all, childbirth is a normal aspect of womanhood and does not require medication as if one were ill. However, those with a history of difficult labor must seek remedies as a plan to safeguard their lives. The methods for supporting a fetus differ; for those with phlegm due to excess qi, Zhi Ke Shou Tai San and talc are suitable. For those with qi deficiency and slight heat, Da Sheng San and Shu Tai Wan are appropriate. If one does not carefully assess their deficiency or excess, it is better to abstain from taking any medicine.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br><strong>On Pregnancy Before Conception</strong></p>
<p>The joy of the tremorous wind has its signs, and the pulse of pregnancy must be precise. The measures are slippery at the inch, but abundant at the length; the yang strikes the yin and brings excitement. Although the spirit is weary, the peach-like cheeks are more beautiful; although food is initially distasteful, the heavenly essence does not fall. There is no harm in evil obstructions, yet one must beware of the impurities that cause miscarriage. Heat must be cleared, and the spleen cannot be weak. If heat is not cleared, the fetus will be restless; if the spleen is deficient, the fetus is prone to falling. The foundation is ensuring the stability of the fetus; other mixed conditions are secondary treatments. These are the maxims of the ancients, to be adhered to by future generations.</p>
<p>If the child hangs too low causing urgent pain, do not doubt. If the child suddenly has convulsions, it is indeed alarming. If the child is full and the fetus is fat, there may be excessive qi; if the child suffers from chills and the spleen is weak, there may be insufficient qi. If there is agitation or painful urination, it is due to heat in the fetus; if there is swelling or gas, it is caused by water from the fetus. If there is coughing or dysentery, the illness worsens and harms the fetus; whether due to cold or food disorders, phlegm becomes bitter and harmful. If constantly mournful or laughing, the lung&#39;s qi is stagnated, not a calamity; if one becomes suddenly mute, the heart&#39;s blood is deficient and no medication is needed. If the fetus is heavy yet thin, the rapid progress should be closely monitored, and the pulse must not be misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>After the embryo forms, prohibitions must not be violated; before labor, caution is essential. Prepare medicines and select a capable midwife carefully. Avoid noisy doubts, as they may disturb a mother’s heart; maintain calm and quiet, allowing the mother’s qi to harmonize. If the child&#39;s body has not turned, it is not advisable to sit on the grass too early; once the amniotic fluid has broken, excessive force should also be avoided.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>Whether upside down or sideways, it relies on the midwife&#39;s skilled hands; whether slow or delayed, it hinges on the sacred medicine for childbirth. The stakes of medicine are not light; they hold the fates of mother and child. A slight error can be worse than water and fire. Before the placenta is expelled, it must be handled properly; if lochia has not completely discharged, do not rush to remove it. Blood disorders bring life and death to breath; blood swelling and pain warn against recklessness. Focus primarily on replenishing deficiencies, and do not misinterpret other ailments. The medicine should be pleasantly warm and sweet; bitter and cold must be avoided. Pulses ought to be gentle; rapid and forceful are most undesirable.</p>
<p>Obstructions each pertain to the organs, and various illnesses resemble demonic hindrances. Dizziness as if seeing black flowers indicates illness of the liver; hoarseness as if encountering spirits signifies a condition of fire. Pain below the navel with urination issues indicates stagnation; abdominal pain with bloating signals accumulation. Hard breathing and incessant coughing arise from offending the pure air; lower back pain with difficulty in movement affects the sea of source energy. Restlessness points to deficiency of blood and yin; weakness suggests exhaustion leading to weak qi. </p>
<p>To accurately discern the symptoms is to deliberate on methods and remedies. For stabilizing the fetus, Hu Lian is most suitable in pregnancy; a weak fetus may develop, but observe shape and symptoms to avoid errors. Black spirits expel evil blood and can assist with placental expulsion; the Ten Full restores deficiencies and clears yin fire. Unveil the treasures of the spiritual cavity, unlocking the key to the practice of medicine.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>Nurturing the Fetus</p>
<p>After a woman conceives, it is most important to regulate her diet, favoring light and bland flavors, avoiding cold and hot climates, and constantly obtaining pure and peaceful qi to nurture the fetus. This ensures a strong and stable fetal essence, leading to a healthy birth. Nowadays, women tend to indulge in spicy, sour, fried, fatty, sweet, and cold foods, unaware they should restrain their appetites. This harms the spleen and stomach, making it easier for the fetus to miscarry, as the mingling of cold and heat leads to many ailments in the child. Moreover, excessive sourness harms the liver, excess bitterness harms the heart, too much sweetness harms the spleen, and excess spiciness harms the lungs. An overabundance of salt can harm the kidneys, as the foods consumed can injure the vital organs and affect blood, qi, muscles, and bones, leading to the child&#39;s diseases. After conception, one must exercise great caution regarding feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>Excessive joy can harm the heart and disperse energy; anger can injure the liver and raise energy upward; prolonged thinking can damage the spleen and cause energy stagnation; worry can hurt the lungs and lead to energy blockage; fear can affect the kidneys and lower energy. When maternal energy is harmed, the child’s energy corresponds to it, and there is none without injury. If the mother is harmed, miscarriage may easily occur; if the child is harmed, the internal energies will be uncoordinated, leading to many illnesses. Blindness, deafness, muteness, insanity, and seizures are all due to improper reception of energies.</p>
<p>After a woman conceives, she should not remain in one position for too long while standing, sitting, or lying down, as prolonged actions can harm her muscles and bones; the child in her womb shares energy with the mother, and there will surely be injury. If one engages in excessive passion during intercourse and the child is born with a white membrane on the head, sticky like glue, it is commonly referred to as being born with a &quot;white cap,&quot; which is indeed a sign of the connection between mother and child. When a woman is pregnant, her sleeping area should be protected by someone; she should not sleep alone, as evil energies can easily invade; she should avoid dangerous places, fearing she might fall or get hurt.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p>
<h3>Child Fullness</h3>
<p>When a pregnant woman reaches seven or eight months, the fetus grows large, the abdomen becomes distended, pressing against the childbirth channel, causing discomfort when sitting or lying down. This condition is called &#39;child fullness,&#39; and is treated with the Binding the Fetus Decoction.</p>
<h3>External Diseases</h3>
<p>For a pregnant woman suffering from a sore throat, use the Eastern Garden Cool Diaphragm Powder with one qian of roasted beef seed ground fine. For mouth and tongue ulcers during pregnancy, the Eastern Garden Cool Diaphragm Powder is the primary treatment. Pregnant women often develop breast abscesses; in that case, the Exorcise Toxin Decoction is indicated. If sores or toxins appear on the back, this is related to the Yangming channel. Modify the original formula by removing the green peel and adding one qian each of Cimicifuga and Kudzu root. If sores or toxins appear on the cheeks or chest, this is related to the Shaoyang channel. Modify the original formula by removing the Angelica dahurica and adding Chai Hu, Dan Cao, and Gardenia fruit. For sores or toxins under the shoulder and axilla, which involve the Taiyin channel, remove the green peel from the original formula and add one qian each of dried tangerine peel, Platycodon, mulberry bark, and Asparagus root. For sores or toxins near the inner thighs and genitals, which pertain to the Jueyin channel, remove the Angelica dahurica and double the green peel. For sores or toxins on the palms and soles, concerning the Shaoyin channel, modify the original formula by removing Angelica dahurica, green peel, and Chinese yam powder, and adding one qian each of Huang Lian, Huang Bo, and Mu Tong.</p>

<h3>Discussions of Men and Women<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></h3>
<p>When there is a fetus of both genders, there will be distinctions in the timing of its development; when there are both yin and yang, the orientation of the fetus can vary. A male fetus moves at three months, as yang is early; a female fetus moves at five months, as yin is late. A female fetus is positioned with its back to the mother, which is why the mother’s abdomen is soft; a male fetus is positioned facing the mother, resulting in a hard abdomen. This is all based on reason and should be observed.</p>
<p>In general, if the fetal energy during pregnancy is unstable, the causes are not the same, and the treatment should also differ. The instability of fetal energy must have a cause, whether it be deficiency or excess, cold or heat; all can lead to issues with the fetal energy. Eliminating the source of the problem is the method for stabilizing the pregnancy. Therefore, the methods for stabilizing pregnancy should not be rigid, nor should they be limited to specific months; rather, they should be adapted according to the symptoms and conditions presented, treating the ailment with appropriate remedies, which is the best approach. If one considers baizhu and huangqin to be the ultimate remedies for stabilizing pregnancy and insists on using them, it is rarely without error.</p>
<p>If the fetal energy is unstable due to cold, symptoms may include sour regurgitation, nausea and fullness, preference for warmth, and aversion to coolness. Symptoms may also include cold diarrhea, a pulse that is deep and thin, or no heat signs at all while the fetus is unstable, which all denote a deficiency of yang and cold symptoms. To remedy this, one should warm the interior to stabilize the fetus. It is advisable to use warming stomach drinks or formulas that regulate yin, adding or subtracting ingredients as needed. One should also consider the usual condition of the internal organs when deciding on treatment.</p>
<p>If the fetal energy is unstable due to heat, the symptoms will likely include much restlessness and heat, thirst, or agitation, unclear sensations above and below, blood leakage or red urine, or a slippery and rapid pulse among other signs. For these cases, one should primarily use cooling fetal drinks or formulas that nourish yin.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>For those with heat but not deficiency, remedies like Zhiqiao soup, Yimother pills, and Huangqin powder can be selected to clear the heat and stabilize the fetus. In cases where the fetal energy is deficient and unstable, it is particularly challenging to regulate. Here, there are congenital and acquired deficiencies, both of which are critical to the fetal essence. Congenital deficiencies are due to inherited constitution and should be gradually nurtured according to their Yin and Yang tendencies—one must not rush, seeking preservation. Acquired deficiencies arise from human affairs; all forms of desires, fatigue, dietary excesses, and emotional disturbances can harm the fetal essence. The treatment should focus on understanding the underlying causes and adjusting accordingly with caution. Nonetheless, overall, it pertains to the deficiency of blood and Qi, so the focus should be on the Fetal Essence Decoction. If there is deficiency in the heart and spleen Qi, remedies like Xiaoyao drink, Guizhi soup, and Shoupi decoction should be employed. If the liver and kidney are insufficient below, Left and Right Gui drinks should be used, adapting with Yin tonics. In cases where both Qi and blood are deficient, remedies like Wufu drink, Bachen soup, and Shiquan Dabu soup are appropriate. If there is a deficiency of spleen and kidney Qi accompanied by turbidity, remedies like Miyuan decoction and Tusi decoction should be applied. For excessive vomiting and nausea, it is advisable to combine the previously suggested formulas with Erchen decoction to harmonize. In general, when treating deficiency syndromes, flexibility in response is crucial, as there are no absolute rules.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>The presence of excess and stagnant qi can cause discomfort and fullness. This usually arises when the foundational energy is not deficient, but may be obstructed by stagnation. If one observes the causes and addresses them appropriately, treating these issues is not difficult. For persistent vomiting, the Er Chen Decoction with added bitter orange peel and cardamom is effective, or one can use the Ginseng and Tangerine Peel Decoction, which is also excellent. For food stagnation causing fullness and discomfort, the Xiao He Zhong Decoction with modifications is indicated. If liver qi is stagnant, causing reverse flow and discomfort, the Jie Gan Decoction is effective. If anger provokes liver qi along with heat, the Hua Gan Decoction should be used. For spleen and lung qi stagnation resulting in pain, the Zisu Decoction is advisable. If there is qi stagnation with phlegm, the Si Qi Decoction or Er Chen Decoction with added Angelica is suitable. If qi stagnation is accompanied by heat leading to fullness and agitation, the Bitter Orange Decoction or similar remedies should be prescribed. Wang Jiezai said: In caring for pregnant women, it is essential to clear heat and nourish the blood. White Atractylodes tonifies the spleen and is the chief herb for maintaining a stable pregnancy, while the combination with Huang Qin serves as a holy remedy due to its heat-clearing properties, especially during the hot months. This view, while seemingly rational, must be discerned in the face of significant illness. The qi of the fetus must align with the mother&#39;s organ qi.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>Generally, those with yin deficiency tend to have excess heat; those with yang deficiency tend to have excess cold. If they can feel cold, they are cold; if they can feel heat, they are hot—this is what we call balanced qi. Now, if we say among ten people, three are cold, three are hot, and four are balanced, this is the general comparison. If one claims that after conception internal heat must increase, differing from ordinary individuals, how can we treat those suffering from adverse conditions without using ingredients like Er Chen San, Liu Jun Zi, fresh ginger, and half summer, which undoubtedly increase heat? Therefore, for treating heat, Huangqin is appropriate, but it is not suitable for cold. Not only is it unsuitable for those who are cold, but also for those with balanced qi. Indeed, among today&#39;s pregnant women, there are few with abundant qi and many with qi deficiency. Qi deficiency leads to yang deficiency, and if Huangqin is used again, some may suffer from adverse effects, and even if they do not feel it at the time, it can harm the fetal essence and weaken the mother&#39;s qi, resulting in frailty after childbirth or an increase in the child’s spleen-related illnesses, often due to this. Yet, people today cannot perceive this principle but instead regard the phrase &quot;sacred medicine&quot; as essential to use for pregnant women, regardless of an individual&#39;s yin or yang strength, believing that all medicines for maintaining pregnancy must be used, which can indeed be quite harmful. As for Baizhu, while it is good for stabilizing pregnancy, it may not always work well if used improperly, due to its nature of being drying and qi-constricting. Therefore, for those with yin deficiency, it should not be used alone, and for those with qi stagnation, it should be used judiciously. Thus, the difficulty in prescribing medicine should be like arranging beads—one cannot be rigid in rules while playing music.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br><strong>Aversion to Food</strong>  </p>
<p>For pregnant women, it is common to experience nausea and vomiting, along with a feeling of fullness and inability to eat. However, the causes of these symptoms vary in nature and should be diagnosed and treated accordingly. Generally, aversion to food is often due to a deficiency in the stomach and qi stagnation. However, it can also occur in women who are not originally deficient but suddenly conceive, resulting in obstruction of the qi from ascending, leading to symptoms like nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, why do these symptoms gradually diminish after three months? This is because, as the fetus grows larger, the energy of the organs is primarily devoted to supporting the fetal energy, thus leaving little room for upward obstructions.  </p>
<p>In treating this condition, it is advisable to use formulas like Banxia Fuling Decoction or Renshen Guo Pi Decoction to adjust and gradually calm the situation, ensuring treatment is maintained until the right time for recovery. If there is phlegm in the central abdomen, use Erchen Decoction with Zhike, or rely on Banxia Fuling Decoction. For dietary stagnation causing bloating, a mild Diarrhea Remedy should be modified accordingly. If qi rises and causes a feeling of fullness, use Banxia Fuling Decoction with Zhike, perilla stem, and xiangfu. For deficiency in spleen and stomach qi, utilize formulas such as Wuwei Yigong San, Liu Junzi Decoction, or Renshen Guo Pi Decoction. When there is significant vomiting due to stomach deficiency and cold, use Liuweidihuang Decoction or Warm Stomach Decoction. If vomiting is due to yang deficiency of the liver and kidneys, management should focus on addressing the underlying yin deficiency.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Energy Ascending</strong></p>
<p>During pregnancy, if the proper conditions are lost, it may be caused by emotional disturbances like anger, leading to reversed qi and many signs of pressure upwards. If the qi is reversed and there is fullness and pressure, it&#39;s advisable to use the Liver-Relaxing Decoction. If there is cold in the stomach with fullness and pressure, one should use the Harmonizing Stomach Decoction. If there is stomach fire along with stagnation, the Orange Peel Decoction is recommended. For spleen deficiency with stagnation, the Perilla Decoction is suitable. If the spleen is deficient and qi is not flowing, the Four Gentlemen Decoction should be used, and in severe cases, the Eight Treasures Decoction. If there is spleen qi deficiency with cold, the Five Gentlemen Decoction is appropriate. For cases of both spleen and kidney deficiency with cold and poor circulation, the Regulating Yin Decoction should be used. If both the spleen and kidney qi are deficient with accompanying fire, the Relaxed Powder is recommended, possibly adding Huangqin, Orange Peel, or Sand Ginger. In cases of fetal demise in utero with cold qi pressing upwards, causing nausea and a pale face, treatment should be approached as if for the subsequent fetal movement wanting to abort.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Leakage</strong></p>
<p>When a pregnant woman experiences unstable menstrual flow, it is called fetal leakage. The causes of fetal leakage can arise from either fetal energy or pathological energy, and the influences on fetal energy can also be divided into two categories. I once diagnosed a woman whose pulse was slippery and rapid, without any signs of wind-heat or other illnesses. Upon inquiring about her menstrual flow, it appeared mostly normal but slightly reduced compared to before. I concluded that she must be pregnant, as the fetus was small while her blood volume was considerable. After three months, her menstrual flow ceased, and she successfully gave birth to a boy. Therefore, many pregnant women exhibit similar conditions. It is common to see women delivering babies after seven or eight months, but as long as the blood flow stops, it is deemed premature. However, the conception occurred before the flow ceased, which is something people generally do not understand. Even in cases of fetal energy, there are distinctions in the balance of Yin and Yang. If the mother’s energy is strong and the Yin of the fetus is abundant, leading to excess blood overflow, although the blood may leak, the child will not be weak; this illustrates the strength of Yin and does not necessarily require treatment.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>If the paternal Qi is weak and the fetus cannot fully receive it, while there is a loss of blood, it results in both essence and blood being depleted, leading to a child that will inevitably be weak and small; this is a decline of Yang, which is also not well understood by people. All of this originates from the prenatal aspect, where there is nothing that can provide strength. However, nurturing the roots, can it truly have no method of adjustment? It can be seen that the transition from absence to presence and strengthening the weak hands is not easily achieved, making it not something to be discussed lightly. As for losses due to illness, they can only be treated by addressing the illness itself. For instance, if there is a loss from heat in the blood, one should use Baoyin Decoction or Qinghua Drink accordingly. If anger stirs liver fire causing blood loss, Baoyin Decoction should be used; for severe cases, Huagan Decoction is indicated. If the spleen is deficient and cannot hold the blood, then Shoupi Decoction or four gentlemen formula should be used. For spleen deficiency with blood heat and Qi stagnation, the Four Holy Powder is appropriate. If both the spleen and kidneys are deficient, then Wuyin Decoction is indicated. For simultaneous deficiency of Qi and blood in the Sanjiao, Wufu Drink or Qifu Drink may be used. If fatigue and labor cause blood movement, Shoupi Decoction or Guipi Decoction is advised. If blood loss occurs due to an accidental injury, Wufu Drink or An Tai Powder should be used. When there is Qi deficiency in the Chong and Ren Channels leading to blood being slippery and easily movable, Guding Decoction or Miyuan Decoction should be applied.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>Sudden Blood Loss</p>
<p>When a woman experiences sudden blood loss during pregnancy, there are four possible conditions: it may be due to heat causing the blood to move abnormally, or due to anger obstructing the qi and stirring the blood, or due to trauma affecting the fetal energy and injuring the uterus, or due to the weakness of the spleen and kidneys leading to instability at the gate of life which causes blood loss. All of these are severe instances of blood movement; if not treated promptly, they will certainly lead to miscarriage. </p>
<p>In addressing this issue, one must first assess the quantity of blood lost and what happens afterward. It is particularly important to examine the severity of the pathological factors. If heat remains, one should still clear the heat; if the qi is not yet harmonized, one should also remedy the qi. If the blood moves due to pathogenic factors and the loss leads to a deficiency of vitality, one must prioritize nourishing the original qi to prevent further loss. Treatment may involve addressing either the symptoms or the root cause, or combining both approaches to restore balance. </p>
<p>If one is unclear about the order of treatment or the urgency, there is a risk that symptomatic treatment will be addressed before the root cause is attended to. Therefore, a thorough investigation is necessary. If the blood movement is caused by intense heat, one must evaluate the degree of heat; if mild, a cooling elixir for the fetus may be given, if slightly more severe, a warming decoction may be appropriate, and if extremely severe, one should use Baoyin Decoction or Ziqin Powder. If there is wind-heat in the liver channel causing blood loss, one should employ Fenghuangqing Pill for protection. If anger has harmed the liver, causing qi stagnation and sudden blood movement, then Baoyin Decoction is advisable.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>When there is Qi that is not yet smooth and feels distended and full, use Si Qi Decoction, Er Chen Decoction, or add herbs like Chuanxiong and Angelica. If there is accompanying liver fire, it is appropriate to use the Liver-Transforming Decoction. If there is trauma affecting the fetal Qi, causing injury to the womb and resulting in bleeding, use the Calming Fetus Powder or Jiao Ai Decoction; if there is significant bleeding, double the dose of ginseng. If the patient has fallen from a height, injuring the fetal Qi and causing bleeding, the Yi Mu Cao and Calming Fetus Powder should be used; if there is shock leading to Qi deficiency, ginseng should be added. If the spleen and stomach are inherently weak, or if there is occasional bleeding due to spleen injury, use the Shou Pi Decoction or Gui Pi Decoction; if there is middle Qi sinking, then use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If there is slight heat from blood deficiency and symptoms such as bleeding, use the Xu Duan Decoction. For the aforementioned bleeding conditions, if the amount of blood lost is not considerable, and there is no accumulation of blood, and the fetus is not yet harmed and does not stop moving, then it is crucial to stabilize and strengthen as needed. If the blood has already displaced, accumulating in the womb, causing distension and pain, and the remaining blood has not been expelled, wanting to preserve it becomes difficult, while wanting to remove the blood without harming the nutritive Qi requires using Si Wu Decoction with a large dose of Angelica as the most appropriate choice. If it is noted that the fetal Qi is already moving with a tendency to displace, then Wu Wu Decoction and Jue Jin Decoction are essential medicines.<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Movement and Threat of Miscarriage</strong></p>
<p>When the fetal energy during pregnancy is disturbed, the signs can range from slight restlessness in movement to minor bleeding. If the bleeding is not severe, it is advisable to calm the situation with methods for stabilizing the fetus and remedies for sudden bleeding. However, if there are abdominal pains with significant bleeding, and symptoms such as lower back pain and a feeling of heaviness indicate a serious risk of loss, using the Juejin decoction or Wuwu decoction to aid in expelling the blood is the most appropriate course of action. </p>
<p>If the situation is severe, with a blue tongue, red face, distention, nausea, or if cold air is pushing upwards, the fetus is already deceased, and it is crucial to expel it swiftly to save the mother. In cases of deficiency of vital energy and blood, the Juejin decoction is the best choice. If there is unresponsive distention and prompt action is necessary, urgently use Pingwei powder, one tael, with half a share of wine and water, decocted and taken hot with five qian of Glauber&#39;s salt; or take one tael of Glauber’s salt mixed with child&#39;s urine. This will aid in expelling the fetus. </p>
<p>After expulsion, promptly adjust and replenish based on accompanying symptoms. If there is no urgent abdominal pain, simply using the Juejin decoction with added Glauber’s salt will result in the expulsion of the dead fetus.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>Miscarriage</p>
<p>A fetus is conceived through the union of the male and female principles, with vital energy flowing and blood following. If nourishment is administered smoothly and in harmony, a birth will occur at the proper time. However, if there are interruptions in this nourishing process, the continuity of its source is disrupted, and the fetus cannot remain secure. This can be likened to someone planting seeds: if the necessary moisture is insufficient, they will wither and fall away. Thus, it is said in the Great Treatise on the Five Constants: what is rooted internally is termed the &quot;spiritual mechanism&quot;; when the spirit departs, the mechanism ceases. What is rooted externally is termed &quot;established energy&quot;; when energy halts, transformation ceases. This is exactly what is meant.</p>
<p>Whenever there are cases of miscarriage during pregnancy, it is always due to the depletion of energy channels. The reasons for this depletion can vary: some individuals may be naturally weak, some may be advanced in age and debilitated, some may suffer from worry, anger, or fatigue that exhausts their vitality, and some may recklessly indulge in desires that harm their life force. Furthermore, external factors like falls or improper diet can also injure these energy channels. If the energy channels are damaged, it is unlikely for a fetus to survive unless it possesses an exceptionally strong and resilient constitution. The average person does not have this capacity. </p>
<p>Moreover, a pregnancy lasts ten months and requires careful nurturing; hence, those who frequently experience miscarriages often do so between the third and fifth or seventh months. Subsequent miscarriages will likely happen similarly at the same intervals because the previous injury to the energy channels renders them incapable of sustaining the pregnancy again at the subsequent time.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>Moreover, a woman’s kidneys are connected to the womb, and the waist is considered the organ of the kidneys. Therefore, pregnant women are particularly prone to back pain; if the pain is severe, it may lead to miscarriage, which cannot be ignored. Thus, those who fear miscarriage must understand the reasons for such injuries and take careful precautions. In treating miscarriages, one must understand the source of nourishing the fetus and proactively compensate for any losses. The methods for preserving pregnancy are fundamentally based on this; waiting until the time is near might leave one without recourse.</p>
<p>In general, an unstable pregnancy stems from damage to the vital energy (qi) and blood. When qi is deficient, it cannot uphold the pregnancy, and when blood is deficient, it fails to nourish properly, often resulting in miscarriages. Therefore, those skilled in preserving pregnancies must focus on addressing blood deficiency, primarily using the Fetal Vitality Decoction and adjusting its components; next is the Peony and Chuanxiong Decoction; then there is the Mount Tai Stone Powder, or the Qianjin Fetal Preservation Pills, both of which have the power to assist natural processes and should be used judiciously.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever there is heat in the pregnancy, the blood easily becomes agitated. When the blood is in motion, the fetus is unstable, thus it is common for those with internal heat and deficiency to experience this. If one has spleen deficiency and heat in the blood, the Four Saints Powder is recommended. If there is liver and kidney deficiency with blood heat, a Cooling Fetal Drink is suggested. If there is liver and spleen deficiency with blood heat, a Stabilizing Fetus Decoction should be used. Furthermore, if there are other conditions leading to fetal instability, one should refer to the guidelines for pregnancy preservation and treat accordingly.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>Miscarriage</p>
<p>The signs of miscarriage have varying degrees of severity, distance, innate factors, and human circumstances. Those who have innate weaknesses often suffer from miscarriage, while those affected by human circumstances usually experience it due to injury. Natural childbirth arises from the proper readiness of the body, whereas miscarriage results from forced circumstances. This is why miscarriage should not be taken lightly. If a woman is already aging, having borne many children, desiring another pregnancy becomes difficult. In such cases, the priority should be to ensure the mother&#39;s health. If a young woman experiences a miscarriage due to carelessness, it is crucial to provide proper care and recovery. Otherwise, if she becomes pregnant again, she may face repeated miscarriages, leading to difficulties in having children, which is a serious concern.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>When women reach middle age and their reproductive energy weakens, they often experience difficulties in carrying a fetus to term and are prone to multiple miscarriages; this occurs due to the deficiency of vital energy and blood. When the vital energy and blood are weakened, after a miscarriage, it is common for the uterus to continue to descend as if there is another fetus wanting to be delivered; this is not actually another fetus but a result of qi deficiency causing the uterus to sag. If the mother is unaware, she will be greatly alarmed. This is not a matter of serious concern; simply using formulas like Shoupi Decoction or Eight Treasures, Ten Fully Nourishing, or Xiong Gui Bu Zhong Decoction will suffice to provide reassurance.</p>
<p>In terms of miscarriages, those occurring in the second or third month are considered close, while those in the fifth or sixth month are seen as distant. Early miscarriages are lighter in impact, while those after a longer duration are heavier; this is well-known. If there are still close cases, they will result in concurrent pregnancies and miscarriages. Among families currently facing difficulties in conceiving, it is estimated that five or six out of ten encounter these issues, primarily due to indulgence in desires.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>However, what has been unknown and disbelieved by people since ancient times, I now cautiously use my pen instead of a lamp to guide those who are lost. If this can benefit future generations, it is my deep wish, so let me explain in detail! </p>
<p>The origin of life begins with the unborn: in the first month, it is like dew on a pearl; in the second month, it resembles peach blossoms. By the third and fourth months, the blood vessels and physical body are formed; in the fifth and sixth months, muscles, bones, and hair begin to grow. At the very beginning, it is merely a drop of original essence — this key to life has no dependency yet, and its roots have no ground. If it is nurtured, it becomes solid; if disturbed, it flows away. Therefore, after conception, it is essential to practice restraint, to prevent overflow. Yet the youth, indulging in their desires, are unaware of taking precautions. Even if the fetus desires to be light and carefree, preserving it remains crucial.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br>Some have both courage and strength, relying on their might without defeat, while others, having been defeated, engage in battle again. At such a time, the ruler wishes for tranquility, but the visitor insists on continuing. What can be done about the reckless who pound on doors and walls? Consider the nature of waters that flow with warmth—are there those who do not open the door and instead drift away with the current? At this time, fallen blossoms and powdery butterflies fly together, while fire jujubes and pears intertwine and drift, all merging into the flow, unaware of yesterday&#39;s conception and today&#39;s birth, as the new moon conceives and the full moon delivers. The process of conception and birth is inherently without visible traces. Indeed, when a birth is evident, the fetus has already taken shape, and a miscarriage must be felt. In contrast, when the birth is obscure, the fetus remains like water, slipping away unnoticed. Thus, among today’s courtesans, many do not have substantial offspring; instead, their many small births become the norm. Those who marry courtesans often have few children, as their wombs are slippery and accustomed to small births. I have seen those who struggle for descendants, when asked about their manly skills, reply that they can battle; when asked about their techniques, they say they excel; but when questioned about their situation, they lament, &quot;Everyone has children but me.&quot; Do they not realize that while others bear children clearly, they bear them in secret? Furthermore, for those who conceive and miscarry at three or five months, though this may happen to weak women, it often results from excessive desire and indulgence, which harms the mother’s vitality and leads to miscarriage. Therefore, those who rely on brute strength and excessive bravery often have no children, due to mutual harm between strength and weakness. Likewise, those who indulge without restraint often remain childless, as they deplete the vital energy of the fetus. Can this truly all be blamed on the women?<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br><strong>The Failure of Fetal Growth</strong></p>
<p>The essence of a fetus during pregnancy fundamentally relies on the qualities of blood and qi. If the fetus does not grow, it is simply due to a deficiency of blood and qi. Thus, those who experience continuous bleeding after conception do so because blood does not return to nourish the fetus. Some women in middle age find their blood and qi weakening, akin to a spring that gradually runs dry. Women suffering from numerous digestive issues will have a diminished source of nourishment, leading to insufficient support for the channels. Women who often experience frustration and anger may have their liver qi in rebellion, resulting in an improper balance of blood that fails to adequately support the fetus. Occasionally, insufficient growth may stem from cold blood and qi, indicating weakened yang, which results in a lack of vitality. Conversely, overheating blood may impede growth, as excessive fire harms the true yin. For all these conditions, nourishment and strengthening, warmth and clarity should be considered, responding appropriately to the specific ailment; thus, if timed well, growth may occur, or even if delayed, as the fetal essence gradually accumulates, growth will naturally resume. However, when advanced age leads to blood deficiency, such circumstances are often beyond human control.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br><strong>Ghostly Fetus</strong></p>
<p>The notion of a ghostly fetus among women is not simply an empty illusion; can it truly invade a person&#39;s womb and take shape? This phenomenon arises primarily from the woman&#39;s own weakness in constitution or from accumulated unhealthy thoughts, leading to blood stagnation. When there is an obstruction in the channels, the flow of qi and blood is hindered, representing an internal ailment rather than an external evil influence. It pertains more to symptoms of blood stagnation and qi blockage, which should be treated accordingly. Additionally, encounters with fox spirits or similar entities do have an impact, but they should not be confused with the concept of a ghostly fetus; instead, they too must be addressed through methods related to stagnation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cases of ghostly fetus illness typically involve insufficient blood and qi compounded by stagnation. If one finds their menstrual cycle irregular and begins to nourish and rectify, they are unlikely to suffer this ailment. However, if they are already afflicted, treatment should focus on restoring the fundamental qi first, followed by remedies to eliminate stagnation. For gentle assistance alongside nourishment, there is nothing better than the Juejin Decoction. If one wishes to remove blockage without harshness, the Tongyu Decoction is most suitable. When one aims to address the ailment directly after supplementary treatment, both the Duoming Dan and the Huisheng Dan are worth considering. Alternatively, a concentrated broth of Angelica and safflower with red gold beans also works remarkably well.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a></p>
<h3>On Pregnancy and Moderation of Desires</h3>
<p>Pregnant women should greatly limit their desires. There is much that women may not know, and men also may be ignorant, bordering on foolishness. The strength or weakness of the fetus, the ease or difficulty of childbirth, and the post-natal issues such as hemorrhage and irregularities in the menstrual cycle—all are fundamentally influenced by this. The reason is that during the time of fetal development, it is essential to protect the womb and refrain from excessive desires, which can cause the loss of vital energy. If the defenses are weak, injuries can occur; if the blood and energy do not coalesce properly, chaos ensues; and if the vital essence is depleted, the offspring may perish prematurely, and ailments of the reproductive system will also arise from this. This is paramount for women to exercise caution; those who are wise must take heed.</p>
<h3>Medicine and Nutrition</h3>
<p>For women with both blood and energy deficiency, irregular menstrual flow, and who are unable to conceive, the most effective remedy is to appropriately regulate the use of Yu Lin Zhi (a traditional tonic). Following that, Ba Zhen Yi Mu Wan (Eight Treasures and Nourishing Mother Pills) is also good. If there is severe stagnation due to coldness in the organs, using Xu Si Jiang Sheng Dan (a tonic for fertility) is also effective.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br>All conception in men and women ultimately depends on the state of blood and qi. When blood and qi are harmonious and abundant, there is no case of inability to conceive; those conceived will grow without exception. Those unable to conceive are simply weak in qi and blood; those that do not thrive are due to unstable foundations. Just as various illnesses compound, it all stems from damage to blood and qi. If any evil or countercurrent remains, one should simply use decoctions to slightly correct the imbalance. After correcting, the primary focus must be on harmonizing qi and blood, which is the best approach for a complete remedy.</p>
<p>Thus, in using seeds, pills, or powders, one must not mix them with drugs that disperse wind, eliminate phlegm, or any cold and harsh medicines. For any long-term medications, if combined with such types, over time they will increase qi but ultimately injure qi and blood, making conception difficult. As for Xiangfu (Cyperus rotundus), it is said by Wang Haogu to be an elixir for women, and frequent use can move qi. However, in later generations, it is not discussed in terms of regulating qi, but rather is passed down as an essential medicine for women, applied indiscriminately without consideration for deficiency or excess.</p>
<p>What is overlooked is that Xiangfu, being aromatic with a pungent and dry nature, is primarily for relieving stagnation, dispersing qi, moving blood, and guiding away obstructions. If used for qi deficiency, it can greatly deplete qi; if used for blood deficiency, it can significantly deplete blood. Like the ancient formula for the Ladies’ Golden Pill and the various Xiangfu pills, they should only be used when there is substantial qi and stagnant blood. Yet, among contemporary women, nine out of ten are deficient—can such an important medicine be used indiscriminately? Improper use will gradually weaken them, and the vital force for conception will inevitably fade away.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br><strong>Zihuan</strong></p>
<p>The condition of &quot;Zihuan&quot; (suspended fetus) is characterized by heat in the womb, causing the fetus to be restless and attempting to rise within the amniotic sac, resembling a suspended state; in reality, it is not the fetus that can hang. If one uses strong qi to push downward, it could lead to death. The prescription consists of two qian of ginseng and poria, five qian of white atractylodes and white peony, three qian of yellow quino and raw earth, one qian of eucommia, one liang of cooked earth, and two qian of angelica, all boiled in water for consumption. This formula is solely a divine medicine for benefiting the waist and navel; if one adds a bit of yellow quino to clear it, the fetus will stabilize with the cold. Moreover, the formula is rich in nourishment while lacking excessive coldness, ensuring stability in crisis, with profound meaning within. The fetus is connected between the waist and kidneys, while the amniotic sac is tied at the ren and chong points; hence, the herbs directly enter the internal meridians, solidifying the foundation, causing the fetus to desire movement yet unable to. Especially with the use of heat-clearing herbs, could there be instability below?</p>
<p><strong>Loutai</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Loutai&quot; (threatened miscarriage) is due to insufficient qi and blood. It is urgent to use strong supplements to prevent miscarriage. The formula consists of two qian of ginseng, cornelian cherry, yam, and poria; five qian of white atractylodes and cooked earth; one qian of eucommia, goji berries, angelica, and licorice; three qian of ophiopogon; and five fen of northern five-flavor fruit, all boiled in water for consumption. This formula is neither cold nor hot, a divine medicine for stabilizing the fetus. For anyone experiencing instability in pregnancy, this formula has miraculous effects in calming it. The movements of the fetus are influenced by the exuberance of the parents. Now, by supplementing qi and blood, it naturally stabilizes, so how could there be a risk of miscarriage? Alternatively, one may use the black and white formula for stabilizing the fetus.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Movement</strong></p>
<p>Fetal movement indicates the risk of miscarriage. It should be treated beforehand, and the results are invariably remarkable. Some use the Stop Miscarriage Elixir, which is often more effective than the medicinal herbs meant to stabilize pregnancy. In discussing this, it is said that fetal movement signifies heat, while lack of movement signifies cold. For heat, one should use Huangqin; for cold, Sha Ren. If both heat and cold are present, both Sha Ren and Huangqin should be used. The world does not recognize the balance of heat and cold, mistakenly considering Huangqin and Sha Ren as the only sacred medicines for stabilizing pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Miscarriage</strong></p>
<p>The signs of miscarriage do not occur before delivery, yet they do not align with regular childbirth signs, and should therefore be treated as pre-delivery complications. If someone miscarries without a full delivery, it is termed a miscarriage. Even though there may not be the significant void of a complete delivery, both Qi and blood are still greatly harmed. It is urgent to replenish them to prevent future miscarriages. Use five qian of Ren Shen, Dang Gui, and Bai Zhu; three qian of Fu Ling; one liang of Shu Di; two qian of Du Zhong; and five fen of Pao Jiang, decocted in water for consumption. This formula is indeed a sacred recipe for replenishing Qi and blood. As the fetus moves downward, it will inevitably harm the Dai Mai (a type of meridian), but by replenishing the Qi and blood, the damage to this meridian can regenerate. Consequently, in future pregnancies, there should be no risk of further harm.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br><strong>Prepartum Discharge</strong></p>
<p>There should be no discharge before childbirth. If there is, it indicates a sign of difficult labor; even if fortunate enough for a smooth delivery, there can still be issues with bleeding afterward. One should use three portions of black beans to brew two bowls of soup. First, take one bowl, add ten ginkgo nuts, twenty red dates, one tael of cooked rehmannia, and four qian each of cornelian cherries, coix seeds, and Chinese yam, along with three qian of poria and two qian each of alisma and moutan root. Add two bowls of water and decoct it for consumption. One dose is sufficient, and two doses will prevent white discharge permanently. This can also treat various women&#39;s discharges, all with remarkable efficacy.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy and Cold from the Shaoyin</strong></p>
<p>When a pregnant woman is nearing her term and suddenly feels cold due to wind evil affecting the Shaoyin channel, curling up with cold hands and feet, this is not a treatable condition. The Shaoyin is associated with the kidney channel. Whether the evil affects the channel from the Shaoyin or goes directly into the Shaoyin, if it gives this indication, it is often hard to treat. The Shaoyin kidney channel should be warm and not cold; if wind and cold enter, the fire of the life gate is diminished, and the kidney palace becomes entirely cold, which inevitably causes the uterus to be cold as well. Cold hands and feet indicate extreme cold in the spleen and stomach. When the spleen and stomach are extremely cold, how can one survive? Yet, I believe life is still possible as the fetus has not yet descended. One should urgently use warming herbs to rescue it. The prescription is named &quot;Wind Dispelling and Fetus Rescuing Decoction,&quot; consisting of one tael of ginseng, two taels of atractylodes, and one qian each of cinnamon, dried ginger, and licorice, boiled with water for consumption.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>One dose disperses the cold, and the patient no longer fears the cold; a second dose warms the hands and feet, and the patient no longer curls up in bed; a third dose leads to recovery. Ginseng and white atractylodes are used to stabilize the Qi. Cinnamon and dried ginger, though they disperse the cold, are best used during pregnancy without concern for miscarriage. However, these two flavors are quite potent, thus licorice is used to harmonize them. This way, they simply expel the cold from the abdomen without affecting the fetus, assisting ginseng and white atractylodes in purging and bringing about exceptional results. Is it not hasty to use them excessively?</p>
<p>Pregnant women experiencing symptoms of the Shao Yin channel such as nausea, abdominal pain, and cold extremities should not be treated. This is due to cold entering the kidney, ascending to the heart, and not merely descending to the abdomen, which presents a more severe condition. The water of the kidneys nourishes the heart; how can it simultaneously harm the heart? The true water of the kidneys nourishes the heart, while the pathogenic water from the kidneys harms it.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>Now the kidneys are affected by cold pathogens, causing kidney water to rise and invade the heart, resulting in pain in both the heart and abdomen and simultaneous reversal in the hands and feet. This condition is urgent and critical; what method shall we use to save it? It is merely to drive away the evil of the Lesser Yin. </p>
<p>The formula is &quot;Returning Yang to Rescue the Birth Decoction,&quot; consisting of one tael each of ginseng and angelica, one qian each of cinnamon, dried ginger, and licorice, and five qians of white atractylodes, to be decocted in water and taken. </p>
<p>The cleverness of this formula lies in the addition of angelica. Indeed, the evil of the Lesser Yin dares to invade the heart by taking advantage of the lack of blood within it. Using angelica to tonify the blood supports the strength of ginseng to aid the heart, allowing the heart to be nourished. Meanwhile, cinnamon and dried ginger are simply used to dispel cold and eliminate pathogens. Furthermore, with the benefits of white atractylodes and licorice to regulate the heart and abdomen, this naturally stops the pain and resolves the reversal.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>Zhongjing said that if a child is born, it can be treated with the Ren Shen Decoction to save it, but it is also effective after the child is born, not before the child is born. Prior to the child&#39;s birth, one should urgently use the Revival of Yang Decoction; after the child is born, one should urgently use Zhongjing&#39;s formula. </p>
<p>If a pregnant woman is about to give birth and suddenly feels symptoms of the Shaoyin channel, she should urgently use a large dose of Ren Shen and Bai Zhu to warm her; if it does not respond, it may lead to death, as stated in Zhongjing&#39;s texts. It seems that without Ren Shen and Bai Zhu, there are no other effective medicines. I believe that using only Ren Shen and Bai Zhu may not be completely reliable. If they do not respond, one should urgently add Fu Zi, Rou Gui, and Gan Jiang; it may well respond immediately.</p>
<p>Now, I have established a formula called the Complete Lifesaving Decoction: 2 taels of Ren Shen, 2 taels of Bai Zhu, 1 qian of Fu Zi, 5 fen of Gan Cao, brewed in water for consumption. For any illness caused by the Shaoyin channel, this formula has miraculous effects.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>
<p><strong>Four Substance Decoction</strong>: This is used to treat various ailments in women related to pregnancy and childbirth. Frequently, this decoction is adjusted based on individual needs. The ingredients include Rehmannia, Chuanxiong, Peony, and Dong Quai, with specifics on adding and reducing later.</p>
<p>The right side (口父) indicates to take it as a decoction after grinding. For adjustments: if there is abdominal pain during pregnancy with bleeding, fetal movement is unsettled, or postpartum issues such as excessive lochia or retention, the Four Substance Decoction should be supplemented with dried evodia. If the patient has excess Yang, use less dried evodia; if Yang is deficient, use more.</p>
<p>For unsettled fetal movement with persistent bleeding during pregnancy, the Four Substance Decoction should be combined with ten leaves of mugwort, one slice of donkey-hide gelatin, or include scallions and astragalus. Alternatively, add five to seven leaves of mugwort during each dose, along with scallions and half the amount of donkey-hide gelatin, using a smaller half dose of Dong Quai. </p>
<p>In severe cases, grind all four ingredients down to evenly sized pieces, using four cups of water, a piece of dried mugwort the size of a chicken egg, and five to seven slices of donkey-hide gelatin. Boil until down to two and a half cups, dividing it into four doses to be taken within a day. You can also add powdered licorice, dried ginger, and astragalus, taking two to three doses daily, until the second lunar month, treating one week as a lunar period.</p>
<p>If there is restlessness during pregnancy, add a piece of bamboo shavings to the Four Substance Decoction.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>During pregnancy, if there is a tendency for evil influences, causing a cold face and a pallor, with no desire for food, resulting in emaciation, one may take a decoction of Four Substance Soup with dried tangerine peel, bitter orange, white atractylodes, poria, and licorice. </p>
<p>If there is damage to the fetus leading to persistent bleeding, headache, alternating chills and fever, and tinnitus due to exhaustion of qi and blood, one should take Four Substance Soup with scutellaria, schizonepeta, raw rehmannia, red peony, and ginger. </p>
<p>If fetal movement is accompanied by continuous bleeding, one can take Four Substance Soup with astragalus, cedar, ejiao, licorice, and dang gui. </p>
<p>For calming the fetus and managing bleeding, add ejiao, mugwort, licorice, and prepared pollen to Four Substance Soup. </p>
<p>In cases of small intestine qi pain during conception, Four Substance Soup can be supplemented with musk and fennel. </p>
<p>For coughing during pregnancy, add bitter orange, licorice, winter flower, anemarrhena, aristolochia, pinellia, mutong, vine, ginseng, platycodon, and ophiopogon to Four Substance Soup. </p>
<p>If fetal qi conflicts with the liver, causing weakness in the waist and legs, making movement difficult, use Four Substance Soup with bitter orange, mutong, licorice, forsythia, schizonepeta, rehmannia, dhaturo, and gardenia, to be taken on an empty stomach. </p>
<p>For women before giving birth, Four Substance Soup can be taken once or twice daily. </p>

<p>As for acupuncture:</p>
<p>&quot;The Essentials of the Golden Coffer&quot; states: if a woman suffers a miscarriage, feeling fullness in the abdomen and not able to urinate, with heaviness below the waist resembling water retention for seven months, the Taiyin needs to be nourished; this means the heart energy is full, and one should needle the Laogong and Guanyuan points. If urination improves, she will recover. </p>
<p>&quot;The Classic of Acupuncture&quot; states: if the child discharges red or white discharge, needle the Yaoyang point. For women&#39;s post-lactation ailments, needle the Chongmen point.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: In the third month of pregnancy, if the fetus is at risk of miscarriage, moxibustion should be applied one inch below the knee at seven spots. In the first month of pregnancy, nourish the foot jueyin pulse; in the second month, nourish the foot shaoyang pulse; in the third month, nourish the hand xin main pulse; in the fourth month, nourish the hand shaoyang pulse; in the fifth month, nourish the foot taiyin pulse; in the sixth month, nourish the foot yangming pulse; in the seventh month, nourish the hand taiyin pulse; in the eighth month, nourish the hand yangming pulse; in the ninth month, nourish the foot shaoyin pulse. Each month, when nourishing the fetus with these pulses, acupuncture or moxibustion should not be performed.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Introduction&quot; states: Pregnant women should not undergo acupuncture at Hegu (LI4) or Sanyinjiao (SP6).</p>
<p>When a woman is about to give birth, if the fetus has already ruptured, and foul water flows continuously, and there is early cessation of blood to nourish, leading to exhaustion, puncture the point at Duyin (the fifth point of the Yinqiao) between the third joint of the little toe, five-tenths of an inch into Chengyin.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: If there are alternating chills and fever, coughing with blood and phlegm, or vomiting with loss of appetite and weakness, or chest fullness with pain along the spine, or a mouth that produces saliva like frost and snow, without speech, or tinnitus, or excessive phlegm and saliva day and night, it is due to the misuse of hot medicines. Puncture Fengmen (BL12) and Po Hu (BL42) each by five-tenths of an inch, and through the point at Zhigou (TE5). If chills and fever persist, puncture the absolute bones (Yao) at five-tenths of an inch, and Taixi (KD3) at three-tenths of an inch. If the pulse and qi are still unbalanced, then drain Taiyuan (LU9) and Taibai (SP3) each by two-tenths of an inch. Heat accumulation at unspecified points can be treated by draining for immediate effect or nourishing for deficient conditions to resolve pre-labor issues. After the condition stabilizes, there will surely be a change within half a year; if limbs become emaciated and the abdomen swells, then puncture Yinjiao (SP6) to remove the harmful substances.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The text from &quot;The Filial Conduct of the Confucian School&quot; states: A person from Dai went to Dong Qi, where a woman was suffering from severe constipation and difficult urination, having been unable to conceive for half her life. When she took a laxative, her bowels moved freely, but when she stopped the medicine, her condition would worsen. Suddenly, she became pregnant, and during the fourth or fifth month, the physician prohibited laxatives, leading to her usual difficulty with bowel movements. When she tried to defecate, she exerted herself greatly, resulting in a miscarriage. This happened three times. By the time she became pregnant for the third or fourth month, both her urine and bowel movements were still difficult, and she felt a sweet separation from her pregnancy, prompting her to consult the person from Dai. Upon examining her pulse, the physician found it slippery and strong, but because she was pregnant, he didn’t dare to apply strong treatments and opted for dietary therapy instead. He prepared dishes using flower alkali to cook water chestnuts and sunflower greens, made porridge with plantago seeds mixed with pig and sheep blood for her to eat. After half a year, she miraculously gave birth, and her constipation was finally cured.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a><br>Mr. Liu&#39;s wife was six months pregnant but experienced bleeding due to an injury, so she sought medicine from Mr. Dai. Mr. Dai diagnosed her and prescribed a combination of Sanhe Decoction, Yuzhu Powder, Chengqi Decoction, and Siwu Decoction, adding a decoction of (Shibu) Nitrate. After several doses, the pain, which felt as if pinched by hand, ceased and the bleeding also stopped.</p>
<p>A woman over forty became pregnant, believing that due to her age and many ailments, her sickness had returned and reported this to the physician. The physician, failing to investigate properly, applied moxibustion around her navel and used toxic medicine to attack her condition, resulting in increased abdominal pain, reduced appetite, and she grew gaunt, eventually lying in bed. She sought Mr. Dai&#39;s help. Mr. Dai checked her pulse and said: &quot;All six pulses are even, but the pulse at the right wrist is strong and large; this indicates pregnancy.&quot; Everyone laughed at him. A few months later, she gave birth to a girl, whose lower eyelids bore marks from moxibustion, nearly losing her sight. It is crucial to inquire about pregnancy first when treating women; one must not act hastily.</p>
<p>The wife of King Hu was afflicted with a mass below her navel, along with vomiting and loss of appetite; she appeared pale and emaciated with no menstrual flow. Some suggested it was due to a lack of blood and qi, but treatment was ineffective. Mr. Dai observed her and declared she was pregnant, though the person did not believe it. After repeated requests for treatment from Mr. Dai, he gave her a mild remedy to satisfy her desire but refused to prescribe toxic medicine. Eventually, after a month, she indeed gave birth. When asked how he recognized it, Mr. Dai replied: &quot;The pulse at the wrist is strong and large; as mentioned in the &#39;Suwen,&#39; it refers to the distinction between yin and yang as indicated by the pulse.&quot;<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a><br>Zhu Zhenheng&#39;s &quot;Mind Method&quot; states: A woman, three months pregnant, experiences phlegm and water along with food every day, feeling a rushing sensation in the lower abdomen during the early morning. At these times, she feels fullness in the diaphragm, followed by vomiting, a flushed face with slight agitation, dizziness, inability to rise from bed, and aching limbs with mild thirst. This indicates liver fire along with the Qi of the Chong vessel rushing upwards. Some days are worse, some are better. The pulse is harmonious, yet the right inch pulse is strong and large. If a hundred medications are ineffective, one should wait two months. Occasionally, using sandalwood to grind in water to dissolve the Bao Long Wan, one dose can relieve the fullness in the diaphragm and prevent the Qi from rushing upwards; after two or three doses, vomiting stops, dizziness reduces, and eating becomes stable.</p>
<p>A woman from the Ying family, seven months pregnant, sometimes vomits food, with the fetus causing fullness and obstruction beneath the heart, Qi attacking the back, and both elbows pained, needing someone to constantly rub and press. By applying heat and massaging, she manages to vomit a little, with a strong pulse. The remedy consisted of two and a half qian of huang qin, one qian of stir-fried huang lian, two qian each of stir-fried bai zhu and ban xia, five fen each of roasted gan cao and sha ren, one qian each of chen pi, dang gui, shan zhi, stir-fried zhi ke, xiang fu, ren shen, and cang zhu, and one and a half qian of fu ling, along with seven slices of fresh ginger. After taking two doses, the chaotic vomiting ceased and the fullness diminished. However, during the night, she experienced back and elbow pain, so she applied heat again, and subsequently took the Bao Long Wan, which relieved the ailment as if it were gone.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a><br>A woman nearing thirty years of age, two months pregnant, suffered from vomiting and dizziness, feeling that she could not withstand it. She took ginseng, astragalus, chuanxiong, dried tangerine peel, and poria, but after five or seven days, felt increasingly heavy. I was called to pulse diagnose her; both hands showed a string-like pulse, particularly weak on the left side. I said: &quot;This is a case of adverse pregnancy conditions, certainly agitated by anger.&quot; Upon inquiry, this proved true. With the liver&#39;s qi counterflowing and intertwined with the fetal qi, tonics like ginseng and astragalus were highly inappropriate. I advised her to take a decoction of poria and to use 24 pills of Yiqing Wan, after which she felt somewhat better. Upon examining her pulse, there were slight irregularities; she reported dry mouth and bitterness, and that eating congee made her mouth sour. I suspected this was due to stagnant qi in the diaphragm. I instructed her to take a herbal formulation of chuanxiong, dried tangerine peel, gardenia fruit, poria, and ginger, plus 15 pills of Yiqing Wan. After ten days, her remaining symptoms were resolved, but she noticed a sour taste after meals and felt easily hungry when not eating. I said the liver heat had not yet subsided. I instructed her to take a light broth with 20 pills of Yiqing Wan, and after twenty days, she was stable. Upon checking her pulse again, although both hands showed peace, the pulse on the right was still weak; thus, I warned that a miscarriage was imminent. Now that the liver&#39;s qi was balanced, ginseng and astragalus could be used. I began using these tonics to prevent miscarriage, addressing her future deficiency. After one month of this treatment, she miscarried but remained calm and without issues afterward. Yiqing Wan consists solely of a single ingredient, huanglian (coptis).<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a><br>A woman who was six months pregnant suddenly had convulsions, with her limbs stiffening and her face turning dark purple. She closed her eyes and drooled, becoming delirious and unresponsive for a while before waking up. The doctor applied over fifty doses of an invigorating pill, but her condition came and went without any improvement. It was only when she was about to give birth that she recovered. She delivered a girl, and both mother and child were safe. </p>
<p>The following year, her husband suspected that she might suffer from the same troubling condition again, so he sought treatment. When her pulse was checked, it was floating and string-like; upon deeper examination, it was solid and submerged at the bone. Since it was mid-February and her previous convulsions had occurred in May, he was cautious about administering medicine, intending to wait until the appropriate time when he anticipated the condition would recur. By mid-May, her symptoms did indeed return, both in the year of the snake and the horse. He then instructed her to prepare a self-made formula of Feng Tong Sheng powder, using raw licorice with more peach kernels and a little safflower. Whether taking it or expelling it, after four to five doses, her condition gradually became milder, and she ultimately recovered from a rash.<a id="trans-203p" href="#orig-203p" class="marker">[203p]</a><br>A woman in her thirties, pregnant for four months, was suffering from constipation and had difficulty urinating. After taking some medicines including winter melon seeds, she was able to relieve herself, but her energy remained unbalanced. This was caused by her impatience, which had depleted her blood and disrupted her energy. Therefore, I prescribed soothing medications to nourish her energy and blood, bringing her comfort.</p>
<p>Another woman, aged forty-one, was nine months pregnant and had not urinated for three days. She was in severe pain, with swollen legs and felt she could not survive. When I examined her, I found her condition weakened, with a rapid pulse on the right and a slightly more stable pulse on the left. This condition arose from food stagnation harming her energy, making her fetus unable to lift itself and pressing against the bladder, causing her inability to urinate. This is generally how the condition of troubled pregnancy manifests. </p>
<p>I then prepared a prescription to nourish her blood and energy. Once her blood and energy were rectified, the fetus would lift itself, preventing further descent, which would bring her peace of mind. Therefore, I used ginseng, angelica root, white peony, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, roasted licorice, pinellia, and ginger, decocting them into a strong soup. I gave her four doses, allowing her to drink frequently. By the next morning, I also prepared the residue from the four doses into one more decoction, instructing her to drink it quickly and to induce vomiting to release the medicinal soup. This led to immediate urination, which was dark. </p>
<p>Subsequently, I augmented this prescription with large belly peel, bitter orange, green scallion leaves, and twenty doses of cardamom, to prevent weakness before and after delivery. Ultimately, she achieved a safe delivery and remained healthy post childbirth.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a><br>A woman who was seven or eight months pregnant suffered from urinary obstruction, and despite the efforts of numerous doctors, she could not find relief. Her condition worsened with increasing urgency and swelling, and upon examining her pulse, it was weak and thin. I suspected that her blood and energy were insufficient to support the fetus, causing it to descend and press against the bladder opening, making it impossible for her to urinate. I recommended that she take tonifying medicine to uplift and support the fetus, which would then relieve the obstruction. Before the medicine could take effect, the urgency increased further. Thus, I instructed an elderly woman to use fragrant oil on her hands, enter through the delivery door, and support the fetus. As a result, she was able to urinate profusely, and the swelling and urgency immediately alleviated. At the same time, I prescribed a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, and licorice to be decocted and taken. If there was still some urgency, she would continue to support the fetus to aid urination. After three days of this treatment, the fetus gradually rose, and her urination returned to normal.<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a><br>A woman became pregnant but was likely to miscarry by the third month. I instructed her to prepare a strong decoction of white atractylodes and, mixed with two qian of huangqin powder, to take it for three to four weeks, which allowed her to carry the pregnancy to term. This is because pregnancy, reaching the third month, is associated with yang fire, making miscarriage more likely. Otherwise, how could huangqin and white atractylodes be known as wonderful medicines to secure a pregnancy? </p>
<p>A woman over thirty, who had either experienced missed periods or an incomplete physical form in her pregnancy, faced inevitable miscarriage. Observing her temperament—impatient, easily angered, with a dark complexion and strong energy—showed that her yang fire was too excessive; thus, she could not sustain the vital energy to nourish the fetus, and instead, her appetite harmed her vital essence. Therefore, I instructed her to stop menstruation in the second month and used huangqin, white atractylodes, angelica, and licorice, advising her to continue until the end of the third month, which led to the birth of a son.</p>
<p>The &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Ming Medicine&quot; states: My wife once had a miscarriage, and one day experienced heavy bleeding, which resulted in contractions. I gave her a remedy using the urine of a child to awaken her and soon returned the contractions. I urgently prepared a decoction of schizonepeta, administering it as her contractions recurred. However, the medicines to stop the bleeding were ineffective, and suddenly she vomited. I provided her with the child’s urine and found it filled her chest. I used my hand to induce vomiting, and after a short while, she expelled a bowl of rice and pickled vegetables. When inquiring about this incident, she had become angry just after lunch, which caused the bleeding to continue. I concluded that due to her recent fullness of food, her stomach energy was stagnant, leading to severe bleeding. Since the bleeding was substantial, her stomach energy was further depleted, resulting in the ineffectiveness of the medicine. Therefore, I urgently needed to regulate her spleen and stomach, and thus I used five qian of white atractylodes, along with two qian each of dried tangerine peel and barley sprouts, which she took as a decoction. Before long, her contractions stopped, and after an additional dose, the bleeding ceased.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a><br>Thus, one must focus on treating the spleen and stomach, taking several doses, allowing the stomach energy to gradually return, and then adding blood tonics to ensure recovery. If one does not carefully evaluate the presence of food stagnation and then administers blood-stopping or blood-moving medicines, would that not be a mistake? Generally, physicians treating various diseases must constantly observe if there is injury from food accumulation. If the patient experiences fullness and discomfort in the chest, vomiting, belching, sour throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or aversion to food, one should ask about their recent diet. Upon confirming injury from food stagnation, adjustments to the spleen and stomach should be made first to digest and regulate the food, and then the primary disease can be treated, or digestive aids can be added to the main medicinal formula. Failing to recognize this may result in using appropriate medicines without effect. The spleen and stomach are fundamentally important; if the stomach energy is damaged, it cannot process the medicinal flavors to achieve results. Additionally, there are cases where one takes medicine right after eating, or sleeps immediately after taking medicine, or takes excessive amounts of medicine, which is termed harming the medicine. It is essential to be aware of these situations.<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: </p>
<p>A pregnant woman experience vomiting and aversion to food, feeling fatigued and wanting to sleep; this is due to a deficiency of stomach qi and obstruction. Two doses of ginseng and tangerine peel decoction gradually improved her condition, followed by one dose of Six Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction with perilla leaf for stabilization.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman feels sourness and nausea, sometimes wanting to vomit; this is because of a deficiency in spleen and stomach, leading to food stagnation. She was treated with Six Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction combined with bitter orange and nutmeg, resulting in recovery. </p>
<p>A pregnant woman experiences vomiting, with abdominal distension and alternating chills and fever, her complexion is pale yellow; this indicates excess of wood affecting the spleen and earth. She was treated with Six Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction added with bupleurum, balloon flower, and bitter orange for stabilization.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman vomits sour fluid and feels fullness in her chest, not wanting to eat; this is due to deficiency in spleen earth, being bullied by liver wood. Her condition improved with Six Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction plus peony, and she was further treated with Four Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction with bitter orange and balloon flower for stabilization.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman has abdominal and chest distension, vomits phlegm and has no appetite; this indicates deficiency in spleen and stomach with phlegm caused by food. She gradually improved with pinellia and poria decoction, and was later treated with Six Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction plus bitter orange, perilla stem, and balloon flower, allowing her to eat normally. Later, due to anger, she experienced flank distension, loss of appetite, vomiting phlegm and nausea; she was treated with pinellia and poria decoction combined with bupleurum and gardenia, which led to her recovery.<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a><br>A pregnant woman experiences internal heat and fever in the afternoon, possibly accompanied by chills and fever, with diminished appetite and thoughts. The fetus may feel like it is dropping or pushing upwards; this indicates a deficiency of blood in the liver channel leading to an active fire. First, administer several doses of a modified Xiaoyao Decoction, then use six gentlemen decoction with Chaihu and Zhike for recovery.</p>
<p>A woman in her sixth month of pregnancy feels weak and fatigued, with a diminished appetite. Labor results in blood flow, and the fetus is unsettled. Treatment involves six gentlemen decoction, Shudihu, Shengma, and Chaihu, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman has a blood discharge; when she takes cooling blood herbs, the bleeding worsens, and she feels fatigued with diminished appetite. This indicates a deficiency of spleen qi that cannot hold blood. Then use the Bei Zhong Yi Qi Decoction for recovery. However, due to anger leading to cold and heat, the bleeding continues; this reflects an excess of liver fire causing blood to boil. Administer a modified Xiaoyao Decoction to stop the bleeding and then stabilize with the Bei Zhong Yi Qi Decoction.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman has blood discharge, experiences fever and thirst, and feels fatigued with reduced appetite. This is due to a deficiency of spleen qi being insulted by liver fire. Use Four Gentlemen Decoction with Chaihu and Shan Zhi Zhi for blood cessation. If anger arises again and the bleeding restarts, switch to Six Gentlemen Decoction with Chaihu, Shan Zhi Zhi, and Shengma for stability.</p>
<p>In the third month of pregnancy, her menstrual period may come three to five times, though not heavily. She maintains her appetite and spirits; this indicates excess blood. When the child grows large enough to drink, it will no longer come. Indeed, this is correct.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a><br>During a six-month pregnancy, a woman experienced frequent anger and bleeding, along with chills, fever, headaches, distension in the sides, abdominal pain, nausea, and reduced appetite. I concluded that the chills and headaches were due to liver fire rising, the distension and pain were caused by obstructed liver qi, the nausea and reduced appetite were due to the liver insulting the spleen and stomach, and the blood in the urine indicated heat in the liver and blood. I treated her with Xiao Chai Hu Tang, adding Shao Yao, roasted black 山栀, and Fu Ling, and she recovered.</p>
<p>In another case, a pregnant woman was fatigued and had a poor appetite; she experienced bleeding after exertion. I administered Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Dang Gui, Shu Di, Sheng Ma, and Chai Hu, and she recovered.</p>
<p>Another pregnant woman, after being angered, felt pressure in her abdomen, with a left pulse that was wiry and rapid, indicating internal liver fire. I used Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Fu Ling, Zhi Ke, and Shan Zhi, and she recovered. However, since her fatigue was linked to a poor appetite, I used Liu Jun Zi to nourish the spleen, adding Chai Hu and Zhi Ke to regulate the liver qi, resulting in her recovery.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman felt pressure in her abdomen, had fullness in her chest, burped frequently, and ate little. This indicated stagnation of spleen qi. I administered Zi Su drink for immediate relief, and later combined Si Jun Zi Tang with Zhi Ke, Chai Hu, and Shan Zhi, and she recovered.</p>
<p>One more pregnant woman, after becoming angry, experienced ineffective digestion and a reduced appetite. This led to weakness in her spleen and stomach, decreasing appetite further, with irregular and loose stools. Over time, her stools became yellow water or showed white. Observing her complexion, I noted yellow indicated a spleen deficiency, while white indicated lung deficiency. In the morning, I gave her Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to support her stomach qi, and in the evening, I provided Liu Jun Zi Tang to nourish her spleen qi, resulting in her recovery.<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a><br>A pregnant woman, due to anger, experienced alternating chills and fever, internal heat and afternoon heat, pain in the flanks and vomiting. When the fetus reached eight months, it did not grow. This was caused by liver and spleen stagnation due to anger. A prescription of Six Gentlemen Decoction, combined with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, Gen Ke, Zi Su, and Jie Geng was used, and the condition improved while the fetus also grew.</p>
<p>A lady of the Honglu family, after suffering from dysentery, found her spirit and mind troubled, and her limbs unusually fatigued. After taking over twenty doses of Ba Zhen San, she gradually improved. However, due to labor and added heat, she developed a headache. A large dose of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Man Jing Zi treated it, and the heat and pain ceased immediately. The previous decoction was continued, and after more than fifty additional doses, she was stable. Later, her delivery was very easy.</p>
<p>A woman experienced pain wanting to miscarry every three to four months. It was deemed to be a painful fetus, and she was treated with two qian of Dong Gui and three qian of cooked Di Huang, which led to recovery.</p>
<p>In the eighth month of her pregnancy, a woman felt the fetus about to fall out as if in labor. Lying down for a long time, she found little comfort, and the condition worsened by afternoon. It was observed that this was due to qi and blood deficiency. In the morning, she took Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Fu Ling and Ban Xia, leading to improvement. She further took Ba Zhen Decoction for adjustment, which assured her stability.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman had severe shortness of breath and phlegm; various medicines were ineffective. She had a history of leucorrhea, which began with swelling below the eyes for over two months, with her face being similarly affected. This indicated qi deficiency with phlegm fluid. After taking several doses of Liu Wei Wan, she recovered.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a><br>A pregnant woman coughs and then experiences discharge; this indicates insufficient lung and kidney qi, unable to control and regulate. Use Bu Zhong Yi Qi to nourish and support the earth and metal. Add the Five Flavors to the Six Flavor Pill to strengthen kidney qi for recovery.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman experiences lower abdominal pain, the fetus is unstable, qi attacks to the sides, and occasionally reverses upward, with difficulty in urination. Use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Qing Pi and Shan Zhi to clear liver fire and recover. Later, due to anger, the lower abdomen becomes distended, urination is hindered, and there is a heavy sensation in the waterway, while the fetus remains unstable. This is also caused by excessive liver wood; use Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction for immediate relief. Then, reinforce the spleen soil with the Four Gentlemen’s Decoction plus Chai Hu and Sheng Ma to stabilize.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman has stagnation in digestion, leading to fullness in the chest and abdomen. Sometimes use Ren Shen Yang Wei Decoction with Qing Pi, Shan Zha, and Zhi Ke; if fullness worsens, the fetus pushes upward, causing nausea and loss of appetite, with a strong, wiry pulse on the right guan. This indicates insufficient spleen soil, bullied by liver wood. Continue with Liu Jun Zi Tang plus Chai Hu and Sheng Ma for recovery. Later, if the lower abdomen feels distended, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to elevate spleen qi, resulting in cure.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman, due to anger, vomits blood clots and does not stop for four days. There is bloating and pain in the sides, with difficult urination. This results from anger, with blood accumulating above, pushing out with the fire. The bloating and abdominal pain, along with difficult urination, signifies liver channel illness. Use Xiao Chai Hu combined with Si Wu for four doses to stop the bleeding; follow with Liu Jun Zi and An Tai Decoction for adjustment and peace.<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a><br>A pregnant woman, six months along, felt fatigued and lacked appetite, her face was pale and hot in the afternoon, yet the fetus was not growing and there was a risk of miscarriage due to overwork. This indicated a deficiency in the spleen’s energy. I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang with additional ginseng, atractylodes, and fu ling for over thirty doses, and gradually, her spleen and stomach became stronger, and the fetus thrived.</p>
<p>Another pregnant woman was unable to extend her limbs; after taking a remedy to expel wind and dry dampness, she had severe stool and phlegm retention. Her limbs would convulse, and I believed it was due to liver fire and blood dryness. I treated her with Ba Zhen Tang and added stir-fried black huang qin as the main ingredient, supplemented with Gou Teng Tang, and she stabilized. However, after becoming angry, her previous symptoms reoccurred with blood in the urine, alternating chills and fever, and difficulty sleeping, along with a reduced appetite. I used Diao Teng San with added shan zhi and chai hu to stop the bleeding; then I applied the modified Xiao Yao San, which alleviated her chills and fever, allowing her to sleep. I used Liu Jun Zi Tang with added bai shao and gou teng, which improved her appetite, and she gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>A woman who had toiled hard had irregular menstruation with alternating chills and fever. At five months of pregnancy, her arms either felt tight or loose; this was caused by liver fire injuring the blood. I treated her with Si Wu Tang plus chai hu, shan zhi, dan pi, and gou teng, and she recovered.</p>
<p>A woman, three months pregnant, after eating, fell ill due to anger and suffered from malaria, vomiting three times in a row. I prescribed Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San for two doses, followed by An Tai Yin for one dose, and she recovered. Later, due to anger, she experienced excessive phlegm, delirious speech, fever, chest distension, and pressure relief was poor; this indicated stagnation of liver and spleen energy. I used modified Xiao Yao San with added chuan xiong, and within two doses, her condition improved significantly, and after four doses, she became stable.<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br>A pregnant woman had a sudden onset of diarrhea, which had since stopped, but she did not want to eat or drink. She experienced a sour taste in her mouth and frequent urges to relieve herself. I said: This is due to the harm and deficiency of the stomach’s qi, and we should use the Four Gentlemen Decoction. She did not believe this and instead took the Ginseng and Stomach Nourishing Decoction. She vomited sour water and felt the fetus was not stable; these medicines worsened her condition. I then administered the Four Gentlemen Decoction, instructing her to first inhale the medicinal scent, and if she did not feel nauseous, to take a small sip. If she were to feel nauseous again, it could disturb the fetus. After about ten days, she recovered.</p>
<p>Minister Bian&#39;s concubine experienced diarrhea during her pregnancy. She used herbs like bitter orange, atractylodes, and coptis, which resulted in abdominal distension, phlegm production, fever, and chills. Whenever food entered her mouth, she felt an urge to vomit; even forcing a spoonful led to sour and uncomfortable sensations. She wanted to use remedies to expel phlegm and regulate q. I said: This is due to the damage to the spleen and stomach, causing phlegm stagnation. If we treat phlegm and qi, we would only harm the spleen and stomach further. Therefore, I crushed ginseng, atractylodes, and roasted ginger into a powder, making pills the size of millet. She was instructed to dissolve three to five pills gradually over time. After three days, she was able to take the Six Gentlemen Decoction daily and soon recovered.</p>
<p>In the case of the scholar Wang, he experienced diarrhea and a dislike of food during his pregnancy, accompanied by nausea. I said: This is due to damage to the spleen&#39;s qi. His family was concerned and insisted he consume rice soup. I advised that even drinking could harm the stomach, and it was unnecessary to force it; he should wait for the spleen and stomach to regain their strength as the stagnation would resolve itself, allowing for natural eating and drinking. He did not believe me and instead took the Ginseng and Stomach Nourishing Decoction, which caused him to vomit sour and bitter water and stimulated the desire for cold and fire-expelling medicines. I cautioned that this would only further harm the stomach’s qi. The classic says that to harm the spleen and stomach is to focus on dietary considerations that suit one’s condition. Eventually, without medication, he indeed recovered.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br>In the case of the official Hu Chengfu, who suffered from long-term pregnancy-related diarrhea and used medicines to alleviate Qi stagnation, her abdomen felt heavy and the fetal energy was unstable. She also tried substances like ejiao and mugwort leaves, but they were ineffective. I noted that the heaviness in her abdomen indicated a deficiency of vital energy, and the fetal movement unrest pointed to excessive internal heat. I prescribed the Ba Zhen Decoction for nourishment and stability, and then the Liu Junzi Decoction, which led to her recovery.</p>
<p>In the case of the official Wang Tiancheng, who experienced diarrhea during pregnancy and was constipated later, his family, being of medical background, tried cooling remedies without effect. Upon examining his pulse, I found it floating and large but weak, indicating a deficiency of Qi and blood. In the morning, I recommended Ba Zhen Decoction with added peach kernel and apricot kernel, and in the evening, I prescribed a modified version of the Xiaoyao Powder with plantago seeds, which resulted in his recovery.</p>
<p>For the student Li Xinggang, whose wife was five months pregnant and had difficulty urinating, none of the various medicines worked. I remarked that only the Ba Wei Pill could save her. Disbelieving, she used a different diuretic, which caused her abdomen to swell, making it difficult for her to get up.</p>
<p>In the case of the scholar Wang Wenyuan&#39;s wife, who was pregnant and had difficulty urinating and significant abdominal swelling, she was nearly in a critical condition. After taking the Ba Wei Jiu Yi dose, her urination became dribbling; upon adding plantago seeds to the pill, her abdomen&#39;s swelling rapidly diminished and she stabilized.</p>
<p>There was a woman who would experience anger leading to heat, side swelling, and dribbling urination, resembling her menstrual period; this lasted for over ten days. At three months pregnant, due to anger, her previous symptoms recurred. In the morning, I prescribed a modified version of the Xiaoyao Powder, and in the evening, an An Tai Decoction, both two doses each, which brought her peace. In the fifth month, after another bout of anger, she bled as if menstruating, which lasted four days without stopping. I repeated the previous medicines, leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br>A pregnant woman experienced retention of urine and internal heat, with her liver pulse being strong and rapid. Upon examination, there were slight tension in the pulse, and she sometimes felt pain in both temples, along with fullness in the flanks. I believed it was due to liver fire and blood deficiency, so I prescribed a modified Xiao Yao San and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, and she gradually recovered. Later, she had alternating chills and fever, or feelings of heat, or irritability, with previous symptoms recurring. I used Ba Zhen San and Xiao Yao San together to clear liver fire and nourish liver blood, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>Another pregnant woman suffered from blood in her urine due to anger, experienced thirst from internal heat, and had alternating chills and fevers. She felt fullness in her chest and breasts, had little appetite, and her liver pulse was weak and stringy, indicating liver channel blood deficiency with heat. I prescribed a modified Xiao Yao San and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan together, and she gradually improved. I then used Ba Zhen Tang with Chai Hu, Dan Pi, and Shan Zhi, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>One pregnant woman, by the fifth month of each pregnancy, felt bodily fatigue, had tasteless food, and experienced swelling in her legs that gradually extended to her entire body, eventually affecting her head and face. This was due to spleen and lung qi deficiency. I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi in the morning and Liu Jun Zi with Su Geng in the evening, leading to her recovery. In treating pregnancy, do not get bogged down by the number of months; simply observe the symptoms of a specific channel and use appropriate remedies.</p>
<p>Another pregnant woman stopped eating and took Zhi Zhu Wan, but continued to experience discomfort in her chest and abdomen, with increasing loss of appetite. I prescribed digestive and relaxing medications, but her fetus was lower than normal. I assessed this as spleen qi deficiency that could not support the pregnancy. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Liu Jun Zi Tang, gradually strengthening the central qi, which helped stabilize her fetus. I also used Ba Zhen Tang with Chai Hu and Sheng Ma for regulation, leading to her full recovery.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a><br>A pregnant woman, feeling sorrow without reason, recovered after taking two doses of jujube soup. Later, she experienced the same issue again and took the previous soup supplemented with four gentlemen&#39;s decoction and added gardenia, which brought her peace.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman was distressed and restless. When her husband asked her, she said she felt sad for no reason. She was given a gentle bamboo shoot soup as the main remedy, supplemented with an eight treasures soup, which helped her feel calm.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman had a fever and thirst, and her body ached all over. She took two doses of the Immortal Vitality Decoction, which slightly alleviated her symptoms. On the 11th day, over a hundred pox appeared on her body, and she felt extremely fatigued. A remedy of lithospermum and aromatic wood was used, and some relief was obtained. However, she still felt dry and thirsty, so she was given ginseng and white atractylodes powder to quench her thirst, followed by an eight treasures soup with added bupleurum and moutan, which helped expel pus. Later, they removed moutan and bupleurum and increased the ginseng and astragalus, administering several doses until the pox marks improved.</p>
<p>A woman at eight months of pregnancy felt her fetus descending or moving, her face was pale, and she felt fatigued with little appetite; she was diagnosed with weak spleen energy. She took a tonifying central qi decoction with increased white atractylodes and added siler; after over thirty doses, she felt better. After childbirth, she had dizziness, fullness in her chest, and a cough. She was treated with a four substances decoction supplemented with poria, pinellia, and balloon flower until she recovered.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Principles and Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment,&quot; it is noted that the wife of a general during her pregnancy suffered from persistent dysentery. When the immortal physician examined her pulse, it was found to be weak and slippery, and her two pulses were very thin. This was due to disharmony in the fetal qi, with excess fire causing heat, resembling dysentery but not being it. Therefore, yellow qin and white atractylodes were used to stabilize the fetus, along with four substances and raw rehmannia to regulate the blood, and after several doses, she was stabilized.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a><br>The divine physician of Bole, known as Hao Weng, was consulted by a scholar named Chen Yaozun regarding his wife&#39;s illness, which many doctors believed to be due to overexertion. Hao said: &quot;Quickly stop the medicine; this is a symptom of pregnancy, and congratulations to you on expecting a son.&quot; Eventually, this was indeed the case.</p>
<p>Another two women were pregnant: one was mute and could not speak. Hao indicated: &quot;The fetus is obstructing the channels; once the child is born, she will speak again. Do not poison her with medicine.&quot; The other woman was robust and strong; Hao diagnosed her pulse and said: &quot;The mother’s energy has already diminished, hence the child survives by relying on the child’s energy.&quot; As expected, the child was born, but the mother died.</p>
<p>A woman was violently thirsty, drinking only a five-flavor juice. The renowned physician Geng Yu diagnosed her pulse and said: &quot;This is blood wanting to coagulate, not an illness.&quot; Eventually, she became pregnant. There is an ancient formula that recognizes the symptom of thirst and coagulation of blood, which should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Doctor Pan Jing diagnosed that the wife of Yu&#39;s Assistant Officer Zhang Xian had been pregnant for five years, the wife of Nanling&#39;s Wei Fu Changling for two years, and the concubine of the envoy Liu Yi Sun for fourteen months, none of whom had given birth. Old man Pan looked at them and declared: &quot;This is a sickness; all doctors mistakenly consider this pregnancy.&quot; Consequently, he administered potent medicines to break the blood and expel toxins. The wife of the Assistant Officer expelled over a hundred flesh-like clots; Wei Changling&#39;s wife dreamed of two dark-skinned boys who abruptly fled in fear; Yi Sun&#39;s concubine gave birth to a large snake, which was still squirming and not yet dead. All three women were unscathed.</p>
<p>Ye Nanzhou&#39;s wife had not menstruated for five months and had discharges of white or red, along with afternoon fevers, coughing, and vomiting. Doctors diagnosed her with consumption from overexertion. Chen Douyan examined her and said: &quot;Both pulses are firm; she must be pregnant, affected by external wind evils.&quot; He prescribed a gentle harmonizing remedy and she gave birth to two sons six months later.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a><br>A pregnant woman for four or five months, feeling depressed and sad, wept bitterly during the day, unable to stretch her limbs, appearing as if possessed by a spirit. Neither physicians nor shamans were of any help. Then, with the remedy from Mr. Guan and the jujube soup from Zhongjing, she recovered immediately. </p>
<p>A pregnant woman was ill, and the doctor said she might miscarriage. Qian Zhongyang remarked: &quot;In pregnancy, the five organs provide nourishment; it generally changes every sixty days. If one adjusts appropriately during her months, why should she have a miscarriage?&quot; In the end, both mother and child were fine.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from a blockage, and the more she treated it, the worse it became. Reflecting on the comment from the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; about stopping treatments for cases of vomiting and purging, she halted her medications, and after a month, found peace.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman seven months along, felt pressure and shortness of breath in her chest, suddenly vomited something about the size of a small intestine. Her family was alarmed, thinking her fetus was rotting. When Cheng Wenbin arrived and diagnosed her pulse as strong and smooth, he realized her Qi was abundant but her blood was insufficient. The fetal Qi accumulated in the middle jiao, leading to damp heat and phlegm production. He identified the vomited substance as consolidated phlegm. The illness was named &quot;fetal hanging,&quot; and with a formula of perilla drink augmented with Scutellaria, Coptis, and Fritillaria for ten doses, she was cured.</p>
<p>Madam Wang, the wife of an official, three months pregnant, experienced recurring pain in her waist and abdomen, with constant leakage and feelings of bloating and discomfort. Yan Jiang was called for a consultation. His diagnosis found her six pulses taut and numerous, in contrast to her usual deep and thin pulse, indicating anger had provoked liver fire, leading to internal heat. Despite a non-slippery pulse, she was not far from treatment failure and could still be preserved. He prescribed a decoction of Scutellaria, Atractylodes, Bitter Orange, Cyperus, Poria, donkey-hide gelatin, White Peony, Angelica, and dried tangerine peel, simmered with fine powdered calcined deer antler wine. Adding Yiping pills, she experienced relief from the pain after just one dose, and several doses later her condition stabilized.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a><br>A woman, having undergone a difficult pregnancy, experienced nausea and dizziness, struggling with her diet. The physician diagnosed her with a condition affecting the heart and spleen, noting that it was customary not to treat women in such a situation when their cycle was absent. Jiang Guan examined her and found that though her pulse was weak, it felt slippery and did not end abruptly, indicating pregnancy but not a dangerous sign. He prescribed a formula of Six Gentlemen with cardamom, taken several times, which brought her comfort.</p>
<p>Another woman, eight months into her pregnancy, suddenly suffered from lower back pain and was unable to turn, with constipation as well. The physician prescribed ginseng and other tonics, but the pain worsened. Using laxatives did not relieve the pain despite the constipation easing. Wang Shishan examined her pulse, finding it somewhat rapid, and concluded it was caused by heat and stagnation of blood. He recommended a formula of Four Substances with added herbs including incense, myrrh, yellow herbal, and hemp seeds. After taking four to five doses, her pain reduced, and the constipation improved, but she developed a fever and redness on her face, along with occasional chills. He adjusted the formula, removing the incense and myrrh, and adding Chai Hu and Huang Qin. After two doses, her chills and fever abated. However, she later felt cold in her back and had a recurrence of back pain; Wang remarked that blood flow had improved, and suggested adding a penny of ginseng to the previous formula. She took it and felt relief.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br>A woman, three months pregnant, experienced a trauma that caused pain in her waist and lower abdomen, along with bleeding and internal heat. Jiang Huang Nan prescribed Angelica, Atractylodes, Scutellaria, cooked Rehmannia, Chuanxiong, Fangfeng, Cardamom, Mugwort leaves, and Cyperus. After decocting these in water and taking the remedy, the bleeding stopped and the abdominal pain eased. He then removed the cardamom and used three egg yolks, mixing them with wine, cooking them until solid, and having her eat it, which resulted in complete recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman frequently experienced transverse presentations in childbirth, having seven or eight pregnancies, but none resulted in viable offspring. Wang Shishan diagnosed her pulse as fine, weak, and somewhat stringy, stating that she suffered from both qi and blood deficiency along with internal heat. Some argued that excess qi and blood were needed for pregnancy, and with both qi and blood depleted, how could she conceive? Observing her long form and fine, weak pulse indicated a deficiency in both qi and blood; a blue complexion with a stringy pulse pointed to fiery liver heat; while the two pulse positions felt floating and slippery suggested a lighter blood deficiency with heavier qi deficiency. </p>
<p>A formula was indicated: Yin Supplement Pills with removed dried tangerine peel, increased Cyperus, ginseng, and astragalus, to be taken as honey pills to ensure continuation of the pregnancy. After a year, she approached her due date and successfully gave birth to a son.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br>A woman, long and thin with a yellow-white complexion, was quick-tempered, over thirty years old, and often suffered from miscarriage, having experienced seven or eight. Wang Shishan examined her pulse, which was soft and weak; both pulses were floating yet feeble and could not endure pressure. He said: This is due to having had too many miscarriages, leading to severe depletion of qi and blood, leaving no nourishment for the fetus, hence the frequent losses. It is like water running dry causing the grain to wither, and soil being eroded causing the trees to fall. Furthermore, during the third and fifth months, it is precisely when the lesser yang fire is active, and coupled with her temperament being quick and urgent, this is why she often miscarried in the third, fifth, and seventh months. It is advisable to take a restorative decoction without cinnamon, adding huangbo and huangqin to be decocted and taken. Additionally, grinding into powder and making honey pills to take, may help preserve the pregnancy. After taking it for six months, the fetus stabilized and she gave birth to two sons.</p>
<p>Another woman had a fragile and small physique, her complexion nearly purple. Over a year after giving birth, her menstrual flow had stopped, and suddenly in early summer, she fell ill with vomiting, numbness in her fingers, and her fists could not open. Her voice was hoarse and soft, and she could not produce sounds. Physicians viewed her symptoms as a serious wind disease. Wang Shishan examined her and found her pulse to be fine and slippery, stating: This is due to pregancy complication. Many argued about her menstrual flow being obstructed, questioning how there could be pregnancy. Wang remarked: In this world, some matters are constant while others change; this is a case of change. Though the pulse was fine and slippery, the pulses at the wrist were not interrupted, indicating pregnancy. Thus, he treated her with Four Gentlemen Decoction plus two Chen herbs, and all her symptoms diminished. She remained wary of porridge and soup, only able to eat dry cakes and aromatic, roasted foods with some vitality.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a><br>A woman, nearing thirty years of age, was thin and pale. Occasionally, she would cough once or twice, with her menstrual cycle either early or delayed. In the summer, she sought relief from the heat and ended up coughing severely, unable to lie down for over a month. The phlegm she coughed up sometimes had blood or pus in it; when the coughing intensified, she would vomit food. Doctors prescribed herbs like Qín and Lián, as well as Er Chén, but there was no effect. They then used tonics like Ginseng and Astragalus, yet her condition worsened. </p>
<p>Doctor Wang Shishan examined her and found her left pulse to be floating and slippery, while her right pulse was somewhat weak and also slippery. Her wrist had been injured and could not extend, and the right pulse seemed difficult to assess. He decided to examine the left pulse again, fearing she might be pregnant with lung abscess. He then prescribed a formula to clear and drain the lungs. After three doses, she was able to lie down, did not vomit phlegm, and did not cough up pus. However, she occasionally experienced difficulty. Doctor Wang stated that this was a common ailment during pregnancy. </p>
<p>He recommended taking a decoction of Coix seed, Atractylodes, Poria, Ophiopogon, Huang Qin, and Ejiao, which led to an improvement. Over a month later, upon re-examination, the pulses were slightly slower and floating, and he remarked that the heat had diminished. However, she was still vomiting too much blood, which could harm her stomach. He advised a decoction of Four Gentlemen&#39;s formula with addition of Chen Pi, Huang Qin, and Zhi Ke to regulate her condition. </p>
<p>As her pregnancy reached six months, she had an adverse reaction after eating chicken. She stopped eating chicken and recovered. By September, her illness recurred, leading to a hoarse voice, and she was advised to take children&#39;s urine for comfort. Doctor Wang said that after childbirth, her illness would resolve, which was a good sign. He warned that if the illness recurred, it was beyond his knowledge. When the pregnancy was full term, her stomach and spleen ailments flared up, leading to excessive discharge, and ultimately, she could not be saved.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a><br>Zhong Cang Xu Shaowei sent a command to Jintan at that time, as the lady was experiencing a miscarriage, and treatment was ongoing without success. Under pressure from the upper authorities, he wished to follow the prevailing momentum and take action, consulting me. I simply instructed that she take Foshou San, believing that if it could stabilize the situation, it would; if not, it would lead to a miscarriage, allowing things to proceed naturally. After taking it several times, he remained anxious and indecisive. A female specialist in gynecology presented a prescription, which included two taels of niuxi (achyranthes) boiled in wine for consumption. She asserted that niuxi is a tonic for the lower body, so what harm could it do? He believed her and consumed it, and indeed, the fetus was expelled. At that time, there was a relative of mine from my mother’s side who was unaware, but when they rushed to inform me, I heard that the entire courtyard was filled with the fragrance of osmanthus and musk, probably because after niuxi was expelled, Xu had introduced fragrant osmanthus powder. Blood then gushed forth uncontrollably, like a river breaking its banks, and I urgently prepared a decoction of dangshen (codonopsis), but before it was ready, she passed away. The gentleman was initially filled with sorrow; as he passed by my place, he pondered aloud to me: &quot;How could niuxi, a supplement, cause a miscarriage?&quot; I replied: &quot;When something is alive, it descends; when it is cooked, it supplements. Therefore, the effects of breaking blood and filling essence are like the tips of arrows supporting each other; isn’t it just niuxi? Lu jiao (deer antler) can also cause miscarriages and break blood, yet when boiled into bai jiao (white glue), it can stabilize pregnancy and stop bleeding. The ignorance of its raw nature leads to such crude practices.&quot; He lamented endlessly. I thus specially wrote this down as a warning for the world.<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a><br>A woman, six or seven months pregnant, suffered from malaria, experiencing chills first and then fever, with her six pulses being floating and tense.

After several days, her condition worsened, and she sought my treatment, which involved administering Qibao San, and she recovered after one dose. </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked how to handle a woman with heavy body toxins. Qibo replied, &quot;If there is a problem, there is no death.&quot; The Emperor asked, &quot;What does that mean?&quot; Qibo explained, &quot;When there is great accumulation, it can be disrupted. If one diminishes more than half of it, they should stop.

After over two months of treatment, the malaria stopped but the dysentery worsened, with added abdominal pain and a reduced appetite. I was called to examine her. I said: It is a deficiency of cold. I prescribed a restorative formula with ginger and cassia, and after one dose, the dysentery had significantly improved. However, after another dose, the malaria worsened again. The family was alarmed, and I said: This is a good sign. The previous cessation of malaria signified an extreme dominance of yin, causing yang to hesitate in contention. Now, with the administration of the restorative yang medicine, the yang energy is empowered to contend with the yin. If we can further support the strength of yang, the yin will retreat of its own accord. I added five fen of fuzi to the formula, and both the malaria and dysentery were cured. After taking the restorative medicine thoroughly for three months, she gave birth to a son, who was very healthy after delivery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Records of Offspring&quot; mentions: The wife of Xiong Jing, the county magistrate of Luotian, was pregnant and suffered from pain and heat in her fifth month. She consulted a female doctor, Zhu Tinghe, who treated her for malaria. Later, she sought the help of a scholar, Wan Yuan, whose treatment added dysentery. By the eighth month, both malaria and dysentery occurred together, prompting her to ask a master for combined treatment. Upon diagnosing her pulse, I found the left hand to be deep and strong, while the right pulse was floating, large, and weak. This indicated an internal injury from male pregnancy. I used a restorative formula combined with qinghao and baizhu, and after over ten doses, both malaria and dysentery ceased. Later, she was stabilized with Hu Lian pills. In the following spring, she indeed gave birth to a boy.<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　妇人半产，多在三个月及五月七月，除跌扑损伤不拘外，若前次三个月而堕，则下次必如期复然。盖先于此时受伤，故后至期必应，乘其虚也。遇有半产者，产后须多服养气血固胎元之药以补其虚损。下次有胎，先于两个半月后，即用固胎药十数服，以防三月之堕；至四个半月后。再服八九服。防过五月，又至六个半月后，再服以防七月。及至九个月内，服丹溪达生散十数服，可保无虞。其有连堕数次，胎元损甚者，服药须多且久，则可以留。方用四物汤加白朮、人参、陈皮、茯苓、甘草、阿胶、艾叶、条芩，多气加香附、砂仁，有痰加姜、制半夏。调理妊娠，在于清热养血，条实黄芩为安胎圣药，清热故也，暑月宜加用之。养胎全在脾胃，譬如钟悬于梁，梁软则钟下坠，折则堕矣。故白朮补脾为安胎君药。若因气恼致胎不安者，宜用川芎、陈皮、茯苓、甘草，多加砂仁，少佐木香以行气。<a id="orig-75p" href="#trans-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>　　　　医学入门 【明　李梴】</p>

<p>　　子悬之证，乃胎热而子不安，身欲起立于胞中，故若悬起之象，其实非子能悬挂也。若作气盛下之，立死矣。方用人参、茯苓各二钱，白朮、白芍各五钱，黄芩、生地各三钱，杜仲一钱、熟地一两，归身二钱，水煎服。此方纯是利腰脐之圣药，少加黄芩清之则胎得寒自定。况方中滋补有余，而寒凉不足，定变扶危，中藏深意。盖胎系于腰肾之间，而胞又结于任冲之际，今药皆直入于内经之中，则深根固蒂，子即欲动而不能；况又用清热之药，有不泰然于下者乎？<br>　　　　　漏胎</p>
<p>　　漏胎乃气血不足之故，急宜以峻补之则胎不漏，方用人参、山茱萸、山药、茯苓各二钱，白朮、熟地各五钱，杜仲、枸杞子、当归身、甘草各一钱，麦冬三钱，北五味五分，水煎服。此方不寒不热，安胎之圣药也。凡有胎不安者，此方安之神效。胎之动也，由于男女之颠狂。今补其气血，自然镇定，又何至漏胎哉！或用黑白安胎散方可。<a id="orig-127p" href="#trans-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>　　　　　胎动</p>
<p>　　胎动则漏胎之兆、以前漏胎方治之，无不神效。或用止漏绝神丹，较胜安胎之药。要而论之，胎动是热，不动是寒。热用黄芩，寒用砂仁，寒热相兼，并用砂仁、黄芩。世不察其寒热，专以黄芩、砂仁为安胎圣药亦谬矣。<br>　　　　　小产</p>
<p>　　小产之证，非产前也，然非正产之证，方可作产前治。如人不正产而先产者，名曰小产。虽无大产之虚，而气血亦大伤矣。宜急补之，则日后坐胎，不至再有崩漏。用人参、当归、白朮各五钱，茯苓三钱，熟地一两，杜仲二钱，炮姜五分，水煎服。此方乃补气补血之圣方。胞动而下，必损带脉，补其气血，则带脉损处可以重生，他日受孕，不致有再损之虞矣。<a id="orig-128p" href="#trans-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>　　　　　产前白带</p>
<p>　　产前无白带也。有则难产之兆，即幸而顺生，产后亦有血运之事。方用黑豆三合，煎汤二碗，先用一碗，入白果十个，红枣二十个，熟地一两，山茱萸、薏苡仁、山药各四钱，茯苓三钱，泽泻、丹皮各二钱，加水二碗，煎服，一剂止，二剂永不白带。亦通治妇人之诸带，无不神效。<br>　　　　　妊娠少阴伤寒</p>
<p>　　妊妇临月，忽感少阴经风邪，恶寒蜷卧手足冷者，不治证也。少阴，肾经也。无论传经至少阴，与直中入少阴，苟得此证，多不能治。盖少阴肾经，宜温而不宜寒，今风寒入之，则命门之火微，而肾宫无非寒气，势必子宫亦寒。手足冷者，脾胃寒极之兆也。脾胃至于寒极，不死何待？而吾以为可生者，以胎之未下也，急以温热药救之。方名散寒救胎汤，人参一两，白朮二两，肉桂、干姜、甘草各一钱，水煎服。<a id="orig-129p" href="#trans-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>一剂而寒散，不恶寒矣；再剂而手足温，不蜷卧矣；三剂痊愈。夫人参、白朮所以固气。肉桂、干姜，虽是散寒，用之于临月之时，何愁胎堕？然毕竟二味性甚猛烈，得甘草以和之，则二味单去袪腹中之寒，而不去催胎中之子，助人参、白朮以扫除，更有殊功耳，岂漫然而多用之哉？　　妊妇临明感少阴经证，恶心腹痛，手足厥逆者不治。亦以寒入肾官，上侵于心，不独下侵于腹已也，较上证更重。夫肾水滋心，何以反至克心？盖肾之真水，心借之养；肾之邪水，心得之亡。<a id="orig-130p" href="#trans-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br>今肾感寒邪，挟肾水而上凌于心，故心腹两相作痛，手足一齐厥逆，此候至急至危，将何术以救之？亦驱其少阴之邪而已。方用回阳救产汤，人参、当归各一两，肉桂、干姜、甘草各一钱，白朮五钱，水煎服。此方妙在加当归。盖少阴之邪，敢上侵于心者，欺心中之无血也。用当归以补血，助人参之力以援心，则心中有养，而肉桂、干姜，无非袪寒荡邪之品；况又有白朮、甘草之利腰脐而调心腹乎？自然痛止而逆除矣。<a id="orig-131p" href="#trans-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br>仲景谓子生则可治，用独参汤以救之，亦救之于生子之后，而非救之于未生子之前也。子未生之前，当急用回阳救产汤；子既生之后，当急用仲景方。　　妊娠临月，忽感少阴证者，急以人参、白朮大剂温之，不应则死，此仲景之文也。似乎舍人参、白朮无可救之药矣。吾以为单用人参、白朮，尚非万全。苟用人参、白朮不应，急加入附子、肉桂、干姜，未必不应如响也。今定一方名全生救难汤，人参、白朮各乙两，附子一钱，甘草五分，水煎服。凡感少阴经之邪者，用此神效。<a id="orig-132p" href="#trans-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>　　　　方</p>

         Discussion on Yin and Yang

The separation of Yin and Yang is said to indicate conception.
[Note: The &quot;separation of Yin&quot; refers to a smooth and strong pulse at the wrist. The &quot;separation of Yang&quot; refers to the pulse at the inch position, appearing to diverge without connecting. This is indicative of pregnancy, as there are internal changes, which is why the pulse at the wrist feels smooth and round like a pearl.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a>

<p>If a woman&#39;s hand exhibits strong pulsations in the little yin pulse, she is pregnant.<br>[Note: &quot;Child&quot; refers to a male. By examining the wrist of a woman&#39;s two hands, if the little yin kidney pulse in the left hand is strong, she is expecting a boy, while a strong pulse in the right hand indicates a girl.]</p>
<p><strong>Theory of Strange Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: Why does a person remain immobile for nine months and become mute? Qi Bo replied: This is due to the obstruction of the connecting vessels of the womb.<br>[Note: The connecting vessels of the womb refer to the vessels associated with the uterus. When pregnancy reaches the ninth month, the womb is fully developed; if there is any obstruction in the connecting vessels, it can result in them being blocked and not functioning.] </p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How do you know this? Qi Bo answered: The connecting vessels of the womb are linked to the kidneys; the little yin pulse penetrates the kidneys and connects to the base of the tongue, hence the inability to speak.<br>[Note: The pathway of sound is governed by the heart, which manages speech, while the lungs manage voice. However, the movement of energy between the kidneys rises to the tongue, enabling the production of sound; therefore, the tongue is considered the mechanism of sound. The connecting vessels of the womb are associated with the arms, and the little yin pulse, which penetrates the kidneys and connects to the base of the tongue, indicates that if the connecting vessels of the womb are obstructed, the little yin pulse is also blocked, preventing the tongue from functioning and resulting in mutism.]</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: How should this be treated? Qi Bo replied: There is no treatment; it will resolve in ten months.<br>[Note: At ten months, when the fetus emerges, the connecting vessels will be unblocked, and the ability to produce sound will return.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Six Elements and Proper Timings</strong></p>
<p>Regarding women carrying a heavy burden, how should one approach toxicity? Qi Bo said: If there are reasons, there will be no miscarriage; if not, there will also be no miscarriage. The Emperor asked: I wish to understand what this reason is. Qi Bo replied: Great accumulation and great gathering may be offended; reduce it by more than half and stop there. If there is excess, it leads to death. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;Heavy burden&quot; refers to the weight of pregnancy; &quot;toxicity&quot; refers to medicines that are excessively cold or hot. During pregnancy, from the first to second month, the wood element governs nurturing; the third and fourth months are ruled by fire; the fifth and sixth months relate to earth; the seventh and eighth months are associated with metal; and the ninth and tenth months pertain to water. By the time the sun is fully set, all five elements have circulated, and the yin and yang of water and fire separate, resulting in the formation of the body after birth. Prior to birth, the energies of the five elements have both abundance and deficiency, dominance and stagnation; thus, one should adjust using methods of cold, heat, warmth, coolness, following or opposing the natural order. If a condition arises, wishing to avoid excessive cold or heat, there should be no harm to the fetal energy, which means there are reasons for no miscarriage, yet one must also not overreach to cause a miscarriage. Just like great accumulation and gathering pertain to the organs corresponding to the five elements, one must be cautious of offending cold and heat. If there is an excess offense, it will lead to death.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji)<br><strong>General Discussion on Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>When a woman has a tranquil pulse and a weak yin pulse, experiences thirst without appetite, and shows no signs of cold or heat, this is termed pregnancy, and Gui Zhi Decoction is the appropriate remedy. In general, this symptom should appear within sixty days. If treated incorrectly and symptoms reverse, with one month adding to vomiting and diarrhea, it should be considered at an end. </p>
<p>For women experiencing excessive bleeding after childbirth that does not cease, or bleeding during pregnancy, if there are symptoms of painful distention in the abdomen, indicating a blockage, Jiao Ai Decoction is the appropriate remedy. </p>
<p>When a woman is six or seven months pregnant, if her pulse is taut and her temperature is elevated, and she feels significant abdominal distention with pain and aversion to cold—especially if the lower abdomen feels like a fan—this indicates that the uterus is opening; thus, Fu Zi Decoction should be used to warm the organs. </p>
<p>For abdominal pain during pregnancy, Dang Gui and Shao Yao Powder is indicated. </p>
<p>For persistent vomiting during pregnancy, Gan Jiang, Ren Shen, and Ban Xia Pill is the remedy. </p>
<p>If a pregnant woman has difficulty urinating but maintains her appetite, Dang Gui, Bei Mu, and Ku Shen Pill is suitable. </p>
<p>For water accumulation during pregnancy, with sensations of heaviness, difficulty in urination, cold sweats, and dizziness upon standing, Kui Zi and Fu Ling Powder should be used. </p>
<p>Pregnant women should regularly take Dang Gui Powder as a general tonic.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

If the movement occurs in the sixth month, it indicates that everything was normal during the first three months; if there is bleeding afterward, it suggests a significant problem. The reason for continuous bleeding is that the condition has not been resolved. In such cases, Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan is the primary remedy. </p>
<p>For those with pre-existing conditions who become pregnant, and if they experience continuous bleeding after three months, with the fetus moving above the navel, this also indicates a serious issue. Generally, fetal movement occurs around the navel, and movement above indicates a problem. </p>
<p>If the pulse at the Cun Kou is tight and large, a tight pulse suggests a reduction in function, and a large pulse indicates excess. A reduced pulse suggests cold, while an excess pulse indicates deficiency. The interplay between cold and deficiency is termed &quot;Ge,&quot; and for women experiencing excessive bleeding, Xuan Fu Hua Tang is the prescribing formula.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>Deer fat and plums; if a pregnant woman eats them, her child may be born with blue blindness. A woman in pregnancy should avoid eating rabbit, goat, turtle, chicken, and duck meat, as it may render the child voiceless. Pears are said to induce cold; thus, postpartum women should also refrain from eating them. If a pregnant woman eats ginger, it may lead to the child being born with excess fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong> (by Wang Shuhe of Jin Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Song of Various Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Blood flows down like the moon&#39;s tide, stopping at the source can lead to the loss of the fetus. This also harms the pregnant mother and causes worry; urgently seek divine pills to remedy the situation. Severe abdominal pain turns the face pale; cold sweat and breathlessness signal impending death. Constant bleeding pushes the fetus upwards; coldness in the heart and abdomen certainly harms the body. If weight is lifted while pregnant, it can lead to the fetus dying within. Loss and persistent bleeding before delivery lead to chaos in the heart and a lonely soul for the mother. Cold-induced headaches affect all joints; breathlessness brings heavy sensations as if drowning in blood. When reddish-black spots appear, persistent heat extinguishes the fetus. Continuous vomiting causes distress and heat, while sore backs and splitting headaches arise. If heat remains in the abdomen for six or seven days, urine may be obstructed and stools constipated.</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on the Pulse of Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse in the middle is uninterrupted, it indicates the true fetal pulse. A strong pulse on the Taiyin indicates a female pregnancy, while a strong pulse on the Yang indicates a male pregnancy. If both are strong, it may lead to twins. This method of assessment shows effects as if by divine intervention. Count the months based on specific sections. If it seems to pulsate in the center, it means the pregnancy will last up to nine months.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Evil Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>For women who are weak and emaciated, lack sufficient blood and energy, and have weak kidney energy, if they are usually unregulated in their emotions or excessively exposed to cold winds while drinking, and if there is dampness in their hearts, they are likely to experience difficulties when they desire to conceive. The term “desiring to conceive” refers to individuals whose menstrual cycle still arrives, whose complexion and skin appears normal, yet they feel heavy and depressed, lack appetite, and do not know the source of their ailment; if their pulse is stable and harmonious, then it indicates a desire for pregnancy. After two months, when they feel an obstruction, it indicates the presence of a fetus. </p>
<p>The symptoms of obstruction include a troubled heart, heavy head, dizziness, heaviness in all limbs, fatigue and reluctance to engage in activities, aversion to certain food odors, a craving for salty and sour fruits, and preferring to lie down. It is often referred to as “evil food.” By three or four months, the symptoms can escalate to severe vomiting and an inability to manage the situation. This is due to menstrual blood being blocked, causing dampness in the organs, and lack of flow resulting in discomfort and nausea. When blood and channels are obstructed, the limbs feel heavy; when wind is involved, it leads to dizziness. </p>
<p>When such signs are present, it is advisable to take several doses of Banxia Fuling Decoction, followed by Fuling Pills with light water to facilitate appetite. Once strength and vitality increase, the mother will be healthy, and the fetus will be well-nourished. There are dozens of remedies for treating obstruction throughout history; regardless of whether the condition stems from deficiency, excess, cold, or heat, those who are gravely ill can find life through this method, which is too numerous to list.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nurturing the Fetus</strong></p>
<p>According to ancient teachings, during the first three months of pregnancy, the fetus is undergoing changes and its qualities have yet to stabilize. Therefore, during these three months, one should aspire to see rare and precious items such as rhinoceroses, elephants, ferocious beasts, jewels, and treasures. One should wish to encounter wise and virtuous individuals, masters of great virtue, and observe proper rituals, music, and military arrangements. Incense should be burned, and one should recite poetry and classical wisdom, both ancient and modern, for guidance. The living space should be simple and quiet; one should avoid improper food and seating arrangements. Activities such as playing the zither should be employed to regulate the mind, harmonize emotions, and temper desires. By maintaining a tranquil life, the child will generally be healthy, long-lived, loyal, filial, benevolent, righteous, wise, and free of ailments. This can be attributed to the prenatal education imparted by King Wen.</p>
<p>When the child is still in the womb and the months are not complete, the balance of yin and yang is not yet attained, and the organs, bones, and joints have not fully developed. Thus, from conception until just before delivery, there are various dietary and living restrictions. Consuming mule meat during pregnancy can lead to difficult childbirth.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Pulse Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The floating and large pulse on the left wrist indicates a male, while the sinking and fine pulse on the right wrist indicates a female. If there is a sudden interruption, it indicates unfavorable conditions regarding the moon and water.</p>
<p>— From &quot;Book of Living Humans&quot; by Zhu Gong, Song Dynasty</p>
<h3>Treatment Methods for Febrile Illness in Pregnant Women</h3>
<p>For a pregnant woman suffering from febrile illness, there is no standard treatment prescribed by Zhongjing. Medication should be used with caution and should not be applied as it would be for ordinary women. For febrile illness while pregnant, it is advisable to use Ejiao powder or Baizhu powder. </p>
<p>If there are symptoms of fever and aversion to cold, one should induce sweating using scallion white soup. If febrile illness presents with chills, trembling, and palpitations, one should use Sonmu soup. For headache due to febrile illness accompanied by loss of appetite, pain in the flanks, and nausea, Huanglong powder is recommended. </p>
<p>In cases of heat-related headache, aversion to cold, high temperature causing restlessness, pain in limbs, stiffness in the back and neck, and dry lips, Chaihu Shigao soup should be used. When febrile illness persists for four to six days, with additional symptoms like abdominal distension, shortness of breath, unquenchable thirst, little food intake, and lower back pain, Zhisuan powder is appropriate. </p>
<p>For headache with dizziness from febrile illness, along with high fever and anxiety, Xuanfu flower soup is recommended. If there is severe fever, vomiting, headache, and restless fetal energy, Maimendong soup should be used. If a pregnant woman develops a rash that turns black, Zhizhi Dayqing soup is indicated. </p>
<p>For severe headache and high fever, accompanied by irritability and vomiting with no food intake, Lu Gen soup is recommended. If the fever and headache persist, Zhi Zi Wu Wu soup is advisable.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>General Discussion</p>
<p>According to &quot;Chao&#39;s Sources of Disease&quot;: In the first month of pregnancy, it is called embryo, nourished by the Foot Jueyin Meridian. In the second month, it is called beginning of fat, nourished by the Foot Shaoyang Meridian. In the third month, it is called beginning of fetus, nourished by the Hand Shenyin Meridian. At this time, blood does not circulate, the form begins to take shape, and there is no established pattern, thus it reacts to environmental influences. If desiring a proper and dignified child, one should often speak proper words and engage in proper conduct; if wanting to have a boy, it is advisable to wear a bow and arrow; if wanting a girl, one should wear ornamental accessories; to have a beautiful child, one should wear white jade; to have a wise and capable child, one should read poetry and books. This is called external appearance influencing internal response. In the fourth month, the essence of water is received to form blood vessels, nourished by the Hand Shaoyang Meridian. In the fifth month, the essence of fire is received to form Qi, nourished by the Foot Taiyin Meridian. In the sixth month, the essence of metal is received to form tendons, nourished by the Foot Yangming Meridian.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

In October, the five organs, six bowels, and joints are all complete, with both spirit and divinity present. This is a general overview. Additionally, the discussion on the five organs mentions a term &quot;Qi Po&quot;: In January, resembling dew on pearls; in February, like peach blossoms; in March, the division of genders; in April, the complete form appears; in May, the tendons and bones are formed; in June, the hair begins to grow; in July, the soul roams, and the child can move the left hand; in August, the spirit roams, and the child can move the right hand; in September, the three turns of the body; in October, the qi is fully received. Moreover, the &quot;Lü Shen Jing&quot; states: In January, it is the coagulation of the essence and blood of the fetal sac; in February, the fetal formation as an embryo; in March, the yang spirit becomes the three souls; in April, the yin spirit becomes the seven phantoms; in May, the five elements differentiate into the five organs; in June, the six laws are established for the six bowels; in July, the essence opens the orifices, connecting to brightness.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

In October, the energies are fully received, and all phenomena are formed. Now, if we delve into numerical theories, those resembling the discussion of the five viscera are all shallow and vulgar, wrongly attributing their names. As for the Tripitaka Buddhist texts, they are often bizarre and unfathomable. Now, referencing the &quot;Luhuan Sutra,&quot; which consists of three volumes, it states that ancient shamans composed it. The discussion of the Nestorian school asserts that pregnancy begins with the formation of the fetus in the third month; this leads to discussions of legitimate words and actions, wearing corded belts, holding bows and arrows, and adorning oneself with rings and white jade, which is akin to the principles of胎教 (fetal education). It is advisable to consider the Nestorian school&#39;s assertion about the nourishment principles of pregnancy, which relate to the Jueyin Liver Meridian and the Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian, indicating one internal organ&#39;s channels. The seasonal influences naturally commence in spring with wood, thus the nourishment of the twelve meridians begins with the liver, suggesting that fetal nourishment occurs in the first and second months.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>Books on prenatal education cannot be dismissed as irrelevant or without merit, yet they should not be treated lightly. Nowadays, in homes of common folk and among those of improper nature, there is little care for avoidance of taboos, leading to negligence. It is fortunate if one does not suffer from harmful substances or is not affected by wind and dew, resulting in both mother and child remaining safe. However, to ensure a healthy pregnancy, one must take various precautions to prevent future issues. For instance, if a neighbor undertakes construction work, it may disturb the prenatal energy, potentially harming the child. Just as injuries can occur from sharp objects, impurities from mud can obstruct passages, physical impacts can cause discoloration, and bindings can lead to muscle constraints. Such phenomena are evident and must not be disregarded.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Chapter on the Original Conception</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of great beginnings, there was the Tai Chu, and in the commencement of great initiation, there was the Tai Shi. When chaos was first differentiated, the essence became evident; thus it is called Tai Chu. Once forms were established, it was designated Tai Shi. When the essence initially took shape, heaven and earth were interdependent, creating and transforming, manifesting all things. Hence it is said: Great is the source, as everything takes its beginnings! Profound is the nurturing earth, for all things draw life from it! At the onset of birth, though the positive aspect of Yang is predominant, nurturing and fulfilling, it is essential to understand that Yin is of greater significance. Due to the transformation of forms, days shift and months change, marking the end of the cycle governed by the earth’s way. This is called conception; when Yang has commenced, it is upheld by Yin, known as Renzi. This is referred to as the womb; with the self being the positive Yang, enveloped by Yin. This is called the embryo; it has not yet formed into a vessel, still referred to as clay. This is called the fetus; it has already fed on its mother, for sustenance. If pregnancy manifests, it stirs at the proper times; if it is but a carrying, the body relies upon it. The virtue of heaven, the essence of earth, and the extreme harmony of Yin and Yang flow together as one body; one must follow the seasonal rhythms, be mindful of human affairs, and refrain from actions that could inflict harm, thereby mastering the path of nurturing. Observing the cycles of the four seasons - growth, storage, and emergence - all myriad forms manifest, harmoniously fitting the measures, while the essence of heaven and earth has never been lacking; indeed, Yin and Yang support and complement one another.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Examining Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>If a woman’s meridians do not flow, and it has been three months, wishing to verify if there is a fetus, take Chuanxiong and grind it into powder, then mix two qian with a strong decoction of mugwort and take it. If there is a slight movement within the abdomen, then there is a fetus.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Unsettled Fetal Movements</strong></p>
<p>When a woman has a strong and robust stomach Qi, along with harmonious Chong and Ren, the fetus can settle properly, like a fish in deep water. However, if the Qi and blood are weak and unable to nourish, the fetus ultimately cannot develop, and it is advisable to induce labor to avoid disaster. </p>
<p>(Note: For earlier symptoms, one should use methods addressing back pain during pregnancy. If the fetus cannot be settled, only then should one consider inducing labor, doing so with utmost caution!)</p>
<p>Fetal movements during pregnancy can be influenced by various factors: diet and daily activities, exposure to wind and cold affecting Chong and Ren, accidental falls or impacts, anger harming the liver, or a weakness of spleen Qi. Each cause should be identified and treated accordingly. If the fetal movements are caused by the mother&#39;s illness, one should treat the mother. Conversely, if the fetal movements lead to the mother&#39;s illness, the focus should solely be on stabilizing the fetus. </p>
<p>In mild cases, there may be unsettled movements, while severe cases could result in miscarriage. If the face is red and the tongue is blue, it indicates fetal death; if the face is blue and the tongue is red with froth at the mouth, it signals maternal death; if both lips and mouth are blue with froth coming out on both sides, it indicates the death of both mother and child.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is internal heat in the afternoon heat, one should use the Xiaoyao Powder. According to the &quot;Great Compendium&quot;: The term &#39;miscarriage&#39; refers to a situation where menstruation occurs during pregnancy after several months. This is due to the deficiency of the Conception and Penetrating vessels, which cannot control the blood of the Yangming and Shaoyin channels. The Conception and Penetrating vessels are considered the sea of the meridians, originating from inside the womb. The Hand Taiyang Small Intestine channel and the Hand Shaoyin Heart channel are its interior and exterior, and they are related to milk production above and menstrual blood below. In pregnant individuals, menstruation ceases because of the obstruction necessary to nurture the fetus and provide nourishment for milk. When the energy in the Conception and Penetrating vessels is deficient, the internal womb leaks and cannot contain the menstrual blood, resulting in its flow during the monthly cycle, also known as &#39;womb leakage&#39;; if the blood is entirely lost, it leads to death. Additionally, factors such as overexertion, excessive emotions, irregularity in diet, consumption of cold foods, and exposure to wind and cold can lead to fetal movements. If the mother has a chronic illness, the fetus may be affected by wind and cold, resulting in imbalances in Qi and blood, and causing instability in the pregnancy, which can lead to bleeding.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There was once a case where a pregnant woman continued to have her monthly cycle without harm to the fetus, and someone consulted the obstetrician Xiong Zonggu. He replied: When a woman&#39;s blood is abundant and her vital energy is weak, she tends to be plump. After conception, if her monthly cycle continues without disturbance to the fetus, one might mistakenly consider this as a case of miscarriage. If treated as a miscarriage, the fetus is sure to be lost. However, if no treatment for miscarriage is applied, the fetus may still survive. Based on Zonggu&#39;s words, there is indeed wisdom. The Chao family states that when a woman experiences absence of menstruation without other afflictions, it is said that she is with child, as her menstrual blood is retained to nourish the fetus and to produce milk. After conception, the resources are used to nourish the fetus; how can they still disperse and be in motion? Therefore, if a pregnant woman regularly experiences her monthly cycle, it does not necessarily mean it is due to abundant blood. If we say that a woman’s menstruation is affected by wind, then her menstrual blood may be inclined to move because the wind is strong. But if the menstruation is overwhelmed by wind, the forthcoming blood is not the nurturing blood for the fetus.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

<p>When a woman&#39;s organs are in harmony, her blood and qi are abundant, and her spirit is strong, then wind and evil spirits cannot harm her.

The treatment method focuses primarily on replenishing original qi, supplemented by dispersing agents like arsenic pills. If there is stagnation in the spleen meridian leading to reversed qi, modify the Gui Pi Decoction for supplementation. If there is spleen deficiency and insufficient blood, use Six Gentlemen Decoction with Chuanxiong and Angelica to nourish it.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Difficulty in Urination</strong></p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant and experiences difficulty in urination, it is caused by heat in the small intestine that obstructs the bladder. If there is also stagnation of qi in the heart and lungs, it may lead to shortness of breath. Chen Wuzhe states that when the fetus is large and pressing on the bladder, it often results in difficulty in urination. If there is deficiency of qi in the heart and kidneys, the clear and turbid fluids may collide, leading to various forms of dysuria. If the fetus is improperly positioned, leading to obstruction in urination, it is called &quot;transformed bladder.&quot; If the fetus is large enough to obstruct the outflow of urine, it is called &quot;enuresis.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Danxi, difficulty in urination due to the bladder being pressed often stems from the weakness of the pregnant woman, who may be anxious and easily agitated, potentially consuming rich foods. Traditional remedies using lubricating and guiding herbs have shown limited effectiveness. If the bladder is merely being pressed by the fetus and cannot expel urine, simply elevating the fetus may allow the bladder to become unobstructed and enable urination. If there is distention in the abdominal area, with obstruction to urination, this indicates a deficiency of spleen and stomach qi, with the fetus pressing on the bladder. The Four Substances, Two Chen, ginseng, and atractylodes can be taken in an empty stomach; vomiting several times may bring relief. I suggest that the prior condition may also indicate deficiency of spleen and lung qi, unable to descend to the bladder; there may also be stagnation of heat in the bladder preventing the proper flow of fluids, or excessive damp-heat in the spleen and earth contributing to the obstruction. Further careful inquiry and treatment should be administered.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Zi Lin</strong></p>
<p>In cases of pregnancy where there is frequent urination known as &quot;Lin,&quot; it is caused by the deficiency-heat of the kidneys and bladder that fails to control water. The pregnant woman’s womb is linked to the kidneys, and when there is deficiency-heat in the kidneys, this condition arises. In severe cases, there may be irritability and confusion, termed &quot;Zi Lin.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If there is a painful cramp in the neck and an expectoration of phlegm, use Ling Yang Jiao San. If urination is scant and dripping, use An Rong San. If there is damp-heat in the liver channel, use Long Dan Jie Gan Tang. If there is deficient-heat in the liver channel, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San. If there are cramps in the legs and feet and urination is not smooth, urgently use Ba Wei Wan; if delayed, it may be beyond saving. If dry medications lead to frequent or difficult urination, use Sheng Di Huang, Fu Ling, Niu Xi, Huang Bo, Zhi Mu, Xiong, Gui, and Gan Cao. If urination is frequent and the urine is yellow, use Si Wu with Huang Bo, Zhi Mu, Wu Wei Zi, Mai Men Dong, and Yuan Shen. If there is deficiency of lung qi causing reduced urination, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with Shan Yao and Mai Men Dong. If there is a weakness in the yin, with frequent urination, use Di Huang Wan. If heat stagnates in the bladder causing difficulty, use Wu Lin San. If the spleen and lungs are dry and unable to generate fluids, Huang Qin Qing Fei Yin is advisable. If the bladder yin is deficient with no yang production, use Zi Shen Wan. If the bladder yang is deficient with no transformation of yin, use Shen Qi Wan.</p>

There can also be spleen deficiency causing excess water. This may arise from diarrhea leading to cold in the organs, or from malaria causing water retention, leading to spleen deficiency and damp accumulation, or water stagnating in the womb, unable to be discharged, all resulting in swelling of the legs, feet, and abdomen. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is also a condition where the body becomes entirely swollen, with a feeling of tightness in the heart and abdomen, known as &quot;pregnancy water.&quot; During pregnancy, when blood is obstructed to nourish the fetus, if there suddenly appears swelling, it is due to water accumulating within the fetus, causing water and blood to clash. The spleen and stomach are affected by dampness; when dampness weakens the energy, it leads to muscle weakness, resulting in the body becoming swollen. The causes can be various: it may arise from diarrhea or dysentery, affecting the internal organs and depleting the spleen and stomach; or it may stem from coldness, heat, or malaria, along with excessive thirst and drinking, which dampens the spleen and stomach, leading to swelling of the face or limbs. If there is water in the womb and the fetus is not yet fully formed, it may cause damage. As labor approaches, a slight swelling may be felt, indicating that there is little water and more blood in the womb, allowing for easier delivery. If there is lingering cold energy, it can cause abdominal swelling and fullness due to exposure to cold.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the &quot;Collection on Lactation,&quot; it is said that after three months of gestation, when the fetus is formed, the legs and knees gradually swell starting from the feet. Walking becomes difficult, leading to shortness of breath, and yellow fluid appears between the toes, which only subsides upon childbirth. This is attributed to the woman having a constitution prone to wind, or issues with the Chong and Ren meridians involving blood wind, thus indiscriminate use of herbal medicine is not advisable. It is also feared that excessive strain near the time of delivery could pose unforeseen risks, so it is imperative to treat the condition before childbirth. Few ancient texts mention this; &quot;Records of Famous Physicians&quot; refers to swelling in the feet during pregnancy. However, &quot;Chao&#39;s Source of Illness&quot; only discusses childhood troubles, while &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; and &quot;Treasures of Childbirth&quot; briefly touch on the issue. Liu Yuhuang in &quot;Continuation of Transmission of Medical Knowledge&quot; considers that water vapor contributes to fetal development during pregnancy, and &quot;Taiping Shenghui&quot; states similarly, both of which are not correct.

<h3>Pulse Examples</h3>
<p>Wang Ziheng said: In pregnancy, if the pulse in all three positions is slippery, large, and rapid, then if it is stronger on the left, it indicates a male child; if stronger on the right, it indicates a female child. The classics state: &quot;Yin engulfs yang, indicating the presence of a child.&quot; The engulfs refers to nearness, as the yin pulse approaches below and the yang pulse emerges above; observing yang within yang confirms that the yang produces the transformation of yin, suggesting the presence of a child. Furthermore, when the shaoyin pulse is very active, it indicates pregnancy. The hand shaoyin belongs to the heart, and the foot shaoyin belongs to the kidneys; the heart governs blood and the kidneys govern essence. When essence and blood intertwine, conception occurs. Additionally, if the three positions of the pulse are equally floating and sinking without disease, it also indicates pregnancy. A floating and exuberant pulse at the left wrist indicates a male fetus; at the right wrist, a female fetus. If both wrists show a floating and exuberant pulse, it indicates two males; if both are sinking and solid, it indicates two females. Additionally, if the middle finger has one throb and one stillness, it indicates a one-month fetus; two throbs and two stillnesses indicate a two-month fetus.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The notes state that the pulse characteristics at the cun, guan, and chi positions correspond to the pregnancy of one boy and one girl.

<p>Sometimes a child may die while the mother lives, or the mother may pass away while the child survives.

The left hand&#39;s cun position represents the sun, where a large floating pulse indicates a boy, while the right hand&#39;s cun position represents the yin, where a sinking fine pulse indicates a girl.</p>

The &#39;fog&#39; aspect refers to moisture and the interaction of upper and lower energies—indicating the husband&#39;s yang energy encompassing the wife&#39;s yin energy, akin to fog nourishing and producing offspring.

<p>(Note: The opposition refers to the child riding the mother, where water influences metal and fire influences wood, corresponding to generating one&#39;s own pulse. The opposing energies refer to the child’s energy clashing with the mother’s energy, creating a counteracting flow. In the harmonious state, metal influences water and wood influences fire, corresponding to the generation of one&#39;s own pulse, wherein the mother&#39;s energy takes precedence over the child&#39;s energy, supporting each other. In general, the embryo grows by means of the four energies of opposition and harmony to nourish and solidify its form.)</p>

<p>(Note: When a woman is five months pregnant, this is when the count begins to see the embryo well-formed and coalescing. The mother&#39;s body must be robust and warm, and at this point, the pulse will be dry and disordered, which is not a sign of illness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When sweating occurs without eating and there is nausea during pregnancy, the spirit becomes unsettled and remains within. This indicates that the embryo receives the vital essence of the five elements to take shape and depends on the two channels to nourish its mother. By the fifth month of pregnancy, although the embryo is formed, its energy is not yet stable. Therefore, the fetal qi ascends to disturb the heart and chest, leading to sweating, lack of appetite, and nausea, a condition known as &quot;vomiting and counterflow,&quot; commonly referred to as &quot;selective food cravings,&quot; where the mother craves sour and spicy tastes to regulate the fetal qi. According to Chi, when a woman initially conceives, it is akin to the birth of water (the essence), and in the second month, it receives the qi of fire, causing the pregnant woman&#39;s body to heat up and her pulse to become chaotic, resulting in sweating, lack of appetite, and nausea. In the third month, it receives the qi of wood, and the spirit settles within, harmonizing the energy to nourish the child while the child&#39;s qi moistens the mother, allowing both energies to nourish and stabilize the child. </p>
<p>If there are lingering ailments beyond three months of pregnancy, it indicates that the condition persists beyond five months for the mother. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The pulse, when observed as slippery and rapid, indicates a condition of insufficient qi and excess blood; if it is not dispersed, it signifies a strong presence of blood and qi, which initially leads to a conception. A pulse that is merely rapid and does not disperse represents a mother in her fifth month of pregnancy.</p>
<p>For pregnant women, an ideal pulse should be tight, strong, slippery, and rapid as a sign of auspiciousness. If the pulse is deep, fine, and weak, it does not correspond with the physical condition, hence it is deemed a sign of death. Although the earlier text mentions the taiyin pulse as deep and fine and also states that various yin indicate femininity, these assertions seem contradictory. However, if the three pulse positions are neither deep nor fine and weak, they are indeed different. </p>
<p>Additionally, according to Tong Jinzi, the earlier mention of the taiyin pulse being deep and fine is thought to indicate a peaceful pregnant pulse, while this current description of deep, fine, and weak pulses as signs of death seems contradictory. Generally, a pregnant woman&#39;s pulse should be tight, strong, and slippery as a sign of health; if all three pulse positions are deep, fine, and weak, it indicates a sign of death.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Child Distress</strong></p>
<p>In the fourth month of pregnancy, one receives the Qi of the Lesser Yin to nourish the essence; in the sixth month, one receives the Qi of the Lesser Yang to nourish the vital energy. Thus, there is much distress and dissatisfaction. If, two months later, there is still distress, it is because the mother has lost balance, the seven emotions have been affected, causing anxiety and fear; for this, use Maimendong Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Correcting the Virtuous Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>Question: What is the reason for restless fetal movement in the third or second month of pregnancy?<br>Answer: The interaction of male and female Yin and Yang, along with the balance of blood and Qi, results in successful conception. However, if there is bleeding from below or abdominal pain, it is due to prolonged deficiency of the uterus, leading to fetal miscarriage, which is more dangerous than a normal birth. If previously affected by such distress, one may take Du Zhong Pills to nourish the fetus.</p>
<p>Question: What is the cause of abdominal pain with fetal movement?<br>Answer: The reasoning for abdominal pain during fetal movement isn&#39;t uniform. It can arise from the consumption of hot or cold foods, exposure to wind or toxic substances, or from excessive shifting and shaking that injures the womb. This often leads to vomiting and disharmony of Qi. If someone has overly taken hot medicine, leading to disharmony of Qi and blood, they should quickly take mild medicine to calm the fetus. Otherwise, it could result in a miscarriage, making it difficult to settle. A sacred decoction could also be considered.</p>
<p>Question: What about abnormal menstrual flow during pregnancy?<br>Answer: When pregnancy is established, yet the fetal breath is not solidified, this may be due to shock or excessive physical labor that injures the womb, or from ingesting toxic substances, leading to a slippery and vacuous uterus, resulting in abnormal menstrual flow. If not treated promptly, the stagnated blood can harm the heart, jeopardizing both mother and child, and may lead to gradual drying of the fetus, bringing imminent danger.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A question was asked: What does it mean when a pregnant woman has a red face, bitter mouth, dry tongue, restless heart, and abdominal distension? The answer is: This is due to indulging excessively in drinking alcohol and consuming peaches, pears, plums, sheep, chicken, wheat, and fish, which are harmful substances that cause soreness in the joints and constipation. One may take Gui Liang Jie Ming San.</p>
<p>A question was asked: What does it mean when there is coldness in the fetus, abdominal distension, weakness and pain, a cold sensation and desire to relieve oneself below the navel, frequent urination, and loose stools? The answer is: When the fetus’s energy is complete and the flesh is formed, it could be due to eating sweet and cold fruits, being in a draught, or receiving unseasonable air, which causes the fetus to be cold, making it unable to find comfort; the skin aches, the muscles and bones are tense, and the hands and feet may cramp. This could cause danger to the mother, so one should urgently take An Tai He Qi San.</p>
<p>A question was asked: What does it mean when a pregnant woman experiences palpitations, frequent disturbances in sleep, swelling in both sides, abdominal fullness, urgent pain around the navel, and restlessness sitting or lying down, with breathlessness causing fetal agitation? The answer is: When the energy of the fetus is formed and the five organs are nourished, this is due to stagnant energy, which might arise from loud noises, causing the heart to race and leading to fetal agitation, pain in the muscles and bones, and restlessness in the limbs. One should urgently boil Da Sheng San to stabilize the pregnancy and avoid danger.</p>
<p>A question was asked: What does it mean when a pregnancy has not reached half the term and results in a premature birth? The answer is: This is mainly because of the weakness of the organs, with deficient energy and blood. When illness arises and manifests, vital energy attacks, damaging the protective energies, which can harm the placenta and lead to a loss, and this is called a premature birth.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

Nourish the new and remove the stagnant, supplement the deficiency and support the weakened—this is managed with Xiangru Buzhong Decoction.</p>
<p>Question: What should we do about small, dribbling urination during pregnancy?<br>Answer: This is generally caused by improper regulation; the fetal organs’ energy is weak, likely due to excessive drinking and indulgence, which harms the blood and energy, leading to water retention and dribbling urination, termed &quot;fetal dribbling.&quot; One should take Anrong Powder to promote smooth urination.</p>
<p>Question: What about experiencing red and white diarrhea during pregnancy?<br>Answer: This is usually due to cold foods harming the spleen, acrid and sour flavors damaging the stomach, and imbalances of hot and cold leading to fetal instability, causing stagnation of energy and blood, resulting in frequent diarrhea, sometimes red, sometimes white, accompanied by abdominal rumbling and heaviness, as well as pain during passage. One should urgently take Mengjiang Huanglian Pills, regardless of whether it is due to heat or cold symptoms—both can be addressed. For abdominal pain and urgent fullness due to diarrhea, one should use Danggui Shaoyao Decoction.</p>
<p>Question: What if there is an external invasion of wind and cold during pregnancy, accompanied by general heat and dizziness?<br>Answer: This typically arises from wind and cold affecting the skin, damaging the protective and nutritive levels, possibly after washing the neck and back or exposing oneself to wind for cooling, which can lead to headache, aversion to cold, fever, and even chest discomfort. In such cases, since both the life of the mother and child are at stake before childbirth, one should not rashly take medicinal soups.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

It is urgent to take an expelling evil powder. Do not wait for vomiting and reversal of thoughts, as it will be difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Question: What of pregnancy complicated by wheezing and acute pain and fullness in the sides?<br>Answer: This is likely due to the dysfunction of the five organs, deficiency in Qi and blood, resulting from consuming raw or cold foods, or experiencing heat with aversion to cold, bluish lips and pale face, muscle and tendon cramps, joint soreness, dry skin, wheezing, constipation, and frequent vomiting. Ping&#39;an Powder is the primary treatment for this.</p>
<p>Question: What about dizziness and impaired vision during pregnancy, accompanied by swollen lymph nodes in the jaw and neck?<br>Answer: This is likely caused by harm to the liver from fetal Qi, heat toxicity ascending, resulting in pain at the temples, vomiting, and stiffness in the shoulders and neck, which causes visual disturbances. If accompanied by phlegm obstruction, it may become critical. Urgently decoct and administer Xiaofeng Powder to dissipate it.</p>
<p>Question: What of a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen?<br>Answer: This may be due to hard food harming the fetus. Once the fetus is affected, it degenerates into spleen and stomach deficiency, leading to cold pressing on the lower abdomen, resembling a &quot;turbulent surge.&quot; There may also be heaviness in the waist, constipation, and noise from the sides.

<p>When a woman is pregnant for nine months and becomes mute, it is due to the disruption of the connecting vessels of the fetus. Therefore, it is said in the classics that this is without cure. However, although this statement exists, it is better to prepare two taels of roasted jade candle powder, simmer it with half a bowl of water until reduced to seven parts, strain it, add a little honey, and let it cool before sipping it occasionally. This will cause the lung fire to descend, clear the lung metal naturally, and restore the voice, as the lungs govern sound.</p>
<p><strong>On the Discussion of the Decoction for Returning to Health</strong><br><strong>By Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant, it hinders the spleen, leading to slow transformation and the generation of dampness, which in turn creates heat. The ancients used Atractylodes and Scutellaria as the sacred medicine for ensuring safe pregnancy, as Atractylodes strengthens the spleen and dries dampness while Scutellaria clears heat. Moreover, pregnancy relies on the nourishment of blood. This formula includes Angelica Sinensis, Ligusticum, and Peony, which are particularly effective in nourishing blood. Taking this medicine will facilitate childbirth, producing healthy children free from fetal toxins, and there will be fewer occurrences of smallpox and measles, leading to easier upbringing, with intelligence and wisdom emerging naturally without need for words. This has been repeatedly tested and verified.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Regulation Method</h3>
<p>For pregnancy regulation, using a mixture of the four substances plus rehydrated dandelion, white atractylodes, and yellow gentian, ground into powder and taken regularly is quite effective. Before childbirth, one should clear heat and nourish the blood. </p>
<p>If the pregnant woman has her energy disturbed by heat, leading to upward issues like rapid breathing, immediately use a powdered combination of yellow gentian and cyperus. Miscarriage is due to qi deficiency and blood heat; yellow gentian stabilizes the pregnancy, as it works in the upper and middle jiao to lower fire and facilitate downward movement. </p>
<p>Motherwort, also known as leonurus, treats various diseases before and after childbirth, promoting blood circulation and nourishing the blood. For difficult labor, it can be made into a paste. Both rehmannia paste and ox knee paste can be used. </p>
<p>The cravings during pregnancy indicate a deficiency in a specific organ; for instance, if the liver is weak, then liver qi can only conceive. Furthermore, if you cannot nourish the liver, the deficiency will lead to a craving for sour substances. </p>
<p>Before childbirth, white atractylodes and yellow gentian are excellent medicines for stabilizing the pregnancy. Cyperus is also a sacred medicine for ensuring a safe pregnancy. Common people do not understand this and mistakenly believe that cold substances should be avoided, thinking that warm medicines can nourish the fetus. They fail to realize that it&#39;s essential to clear heat beforehand so that the blood flows properly without causing disturbances, thus nurturing the fetus.</p>
<p>As the due date approaches, use a combination of three tonics with roasted cyperus and roasted white peony made into pills.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

Thus, it is said that there should be no stagnation before birth, and no deficiency after delivery. For calming the fetus, use Huang Qin (scutellaria), ensuring to select solid and submerged pieces in water as the best choice. For vaginal bleeding due to Qi deficiency and heat, use the Si Wu Decoction with added ejiao beads, bai zhu, tian qin (scutellaria), xiang fu (Cyperus), and sha ren (amomum), with glutinous rice boiled in plain water for consumption. Pregnant women may also experience Qi obstructing the water pathways, leading to swelling; this can be remedied by regulating Qi and calming the spleen, with no obstruction to diet, and swelling will naturally dissipate after delivery.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>A Discussion on Establishing Principles</strong> 【Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng】</p>
<p><strong>Fetal Loss</strong></p>
<p>The male principle exerts influence while the female principle transforms, thus conception is achieved. If there is a deficiency in blood and energy, it fails to nourish, and the fetus will consequently be lost. Sometimes, if there is excessive labor or emotional distress, internal heat will be stirred, which can also lead to fetal loss. Tracing the root cause, it is all due to heat that can consume substances, and thus, the natural order. <em>The Source of Illness</em> states that cold winds harm the fetal organs leading to loss, but this does not reflect the true state of disease. I have observed that women from the Jia family, who are pregnant for around three months, often experience loss. When examining their pulses, the left hand feels large yet weak, and upon pressing more firmly, it shows signs of deficiency, as if there is little blood. Considering their youthful age, it&#39;s best to tonify the central energy to nourish the blood naturally. It was the beginning of summer, so I advised them to take a strong decoction of white atractylodes with a grams of dried scarlet sage, taking three to forty doses, which succeeded in preserving the pregnancy. Thus, reflecting on this, it seems that the cause of loss due to internal heat and deficiency is quite often the case. Whether it is heat or deficiency, one must discern their severity—a skilled practitioner must take this seriously and not underestimate it.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Zhuanbao (Transfusion)</strong></p>
<p>Transfusion illness occurs in pregnant women with a weak constitution, those who are often anxious, quick-tempered, and with a preference for rich foods. Generally, these patients present with such characteristics. Ancient methods commonly employed smooth and laxative medicines, but these seldom yielded results. It was thought that the fetus, when improperly positioned, caused a blockage in the womb.</p>
<p>If the fetus were raised up properly in the center, the connection would be clear, and the fluid would flow naturally. However, if the fetus is positioned lower, there must be a reason for this. </p>
<p>One day, a favored concubine of the Wu household suffered from this condition. The pulse in both hands felt thin, but on further examination, the left hand was slightly more balanced. I said: This is due to worry and distress. The thin pulse indicates a lack of blood and an excess of qi, while the tight pulse suggests fluid retention. With insufficient blood, the womb weakens and cannot support itself; the excess qi and unclear central qi lead to overflow, causing the fetus to descend.</p>
<p>I then prescribed a modified version of the Four Substance Decoction, adding ginseng, atractylodes, pinellia, aged tangerine peel, fresh licorice, and fresh ginger, to be taken on an empty stomach. I instructed to probe the throat to induce vomiting of the medicinal fluid, waiting briefly until the qi was restored, and then to administer another dose; this continued for several days. Following this method over eight doses brought relief.</p>
<p>Though this approach lacks certainty, it may be coincidental. I later used it on several other patients with similar effectiveness, but the true results remain unclear. </p>
<p>Zhongjing states that healthy women usually feel full and robust, while those who are thin may feel empty and depleted; a blockage in the womb also causes the fetus to descend. The meaning of this is not thoroughly explained, and surely there are those who can understand it better.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Essential Points of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy</strong>  </p>
<p>Nausea and vomiting before delivery are characterized by eating and then vomiting, a craving for sour foods, and a tendency to lie down rather than be active. It is commonly referred to as the illness of the child. This condition arises from a pre-existing phlegm and fluid accumulation, with blood stagnation leading to obstruction. Hence, the intake of food rises and stagnates in the liver meridian, where the liver&#39;s flavor is sour, resulting in a preference for sour foods. Metal overcomes wood; therefore, one can counter this with a small Banxia and Fuling decoction, and for more severe cases, use the Erchen decoction. If there is vomiting and inability to eat, with a feeling of heart deficiency and irritability, one should consider using Juzi Su drink with a piece of bamboo shavings. If hot medicines have been taken, causing discomfort and heat in the diaphragm, use Puhuang powder or He Ye powder.  </p>
<p><strong>Transverse Uterus and Distinction from Other Conditions</strong>  </p>
<p>The concept of a transverse uterus is acknowledged in various discussions. As the fetus grows and presses downward towards the uterus, the uterus is compressed and tilted, leading to frequent urination and the phenomenon of “leakage.&quot; The uterus is referred to as the bladder. However, child blockage shares similarities with a transverse uterus, but frequent urination with dripping pain characterizes child blockage, whereas frequent and lesser urine output without pain signifies a transverse uterus. If there is slight pain, it ultimately confirms it is distinct from blockage. One should also use Shengliao Wuling powder with a penny&#39;s worth of ejiao. Various additional formulations for pre-delivery conditions include Wuweizi and Bawei pills compounded with Angelica. One may also consider adding Plantago seeds. The Fahui decoction is particularly effective.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Care and Management During Premature Birth</strong></p>
<p>Women often experience premature birth around three, five, or seven months. Besides injuries from falls, if a woman has a miscarriage after three months, there is a strong likelihood that she will have another miscarriage at the same time in her next pregnancy. This happens because an injury earlier on creates vulnerability at the subsequent time of delivery. </p>
<p>After a premature birth, it is essential to consume nourishing herbs to bolster Qi and blood and stabilize the fetus. For subsequent pregnancies, starting from two and a half months, one should take about ten doses of herbs to strengthen the fetus and prevent a miscarriage at three months; then, after four and a half months, take another eight to nine doses to guard against miscarrying after five months. This should continue with further doses at six and a half months to prevent a miscarriage at seven months. </p>
<p>By nine months, taking ten doses of Danxi Dasheng Powder ensures a secure pregnancy. For women who have suffered multiple miscarriages, a longer and more active course of treatment is necessary to preserve the fetus. The prescription includes Si Wu Decoction combined with Bai Zhu, Ren Shen, Chen Pi, Fu Ling, Gan Cao, Ejiao, Ai Ye, and Biao Qing, with tonifying agents added if there is deficiency, and ginger and processed Ban Xia for phlegm issues.</p>
<p>Managing pregnancy hinges on clearing heat and nourishing blood, with Huang Qin being a sacred herb for stabilizing the fetus due to its cooling properties. Its use is particularly important in hot months. Fetal nourishment relies heavily on the spleen and stomach; if these are weak, it leads to instability in the pregnancy. Therefore, Bai Zhu is the primary herb for supporting the spleen. If a pregnancy is unsettled due to emotional distress, it is advisable to use Chuan Xiong, Chen Pi, Fu Ling, and Gan Cao, adding more Sha Ren and a little Mu Xiang to help facilitate Qi flow.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Before Pregnancy: It Is Important to Clear Heat and Nourish Blood</strong></p>
<p>A woman without illness and experiencing her menstrual cycle is capable of conceiving. If her qi and blood are abundant, she can ensure a safe delivery after ten months, with no risk to either mother or child. However, if the channels are insufficiently nourished and conception occurs by chance, the lack of qi and blood will not properly nourish the fetus. It is advisable to take Eight Treasure Decoction in advance to replenish qi and blood as a preventive measure against miscarriage. </p>
<p>If there is pre-existing heat before conception or if heat arises during pregnancy, along with emotional stress or excessive work, the fetus may become unsettled; in severe cases, miscarriages may occur during the third, fifth, or seventh months. Fire can consume life, so it is prudent to consistently take An Tai Wan to clear excess heat. When the heat is resolved, the blood will flow properly without disruption, thus nourishing the fetus. A saying goes: &quot;It is not advisable to have heat before conception, and there is good reason for this!&quot;<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Monthly Regulation According to the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>If the energy and blood in the meridians are unbalanced, the pregnancy will be unstable. It is vital to regulate according to the meridians each month to avoid miscarriage, and intercourse between male and female is strictly forbidden.</p>
<p><strong>Monthly Pulse Dominance in Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>When a woman conceives, the mother’s blood room opens, and the father’s essence arrives at the right moment. The yin curtain gathers, resembling a bundle of cloth being tied. The essence and blood, propelled by the vital energy, naturally rotate endlessly, akin to a dung beetle rolling and consuming its waste, resulting in conception, forming a rounded orb, akin to the celestial sphere. After nine days, this process continues without pause until yin and yang stabilize, with the original yellow nourishing each other. Externally it resembles intertwined agate, while internally it forms an orifice, hollow and circular, akin to the egg yolk containing a small cavity. The energy outside solidifies into the embryonic membranes, initially thin and gradually thickening, similar to the thin skin that forms on the surface of a mixture of rice drink and soybean milk. Inside, the orifice grows daily, from nonexistence to existence. The essence and blood transform daily, moving from existence to nonexistence. After nine days, another nine days, totaling twenty-seven days, one month is completed, and the orifice naturally condenses into a small entity, much like a dewdrop. This signifies the movement of the ultimate principle giving rise to yang, where &quot;Heaven One produces Water,&quot; referred to as the embryo, primarily governed by the foot jueyin meridian. During this month, the menses are closed without flow or pain; dietary habits should slightly differ from usual, and one must not offend or hastily take medicine.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>On the twenty-seventh day of the ninth period, which is also the number for February, the dew drops change to a red color like peach petals. This signifies that the Tai Chi stills and produces Yin, and the Earth gives birth to Fire, known as &quot;Yang.&quot; It is governed by the lesser Yang meridian. During this month, the abdomen may experience movement or stillness, evoking some uncertainty; there may also be sensations of nausea and sourness, termed &quot;bad obstruction,&quot; indicating a confirmed pregnancy. There might be particular cravings, hinting at a deficiency in a specific organ. For instance, a craving for sour foods suggests that the liver can only nourish the fetus but is itself deficient. If there are sudden abdominal pains or discomfort within two to three months, one should take three qian of Angelica, three qian of donkey-hide gelatin, three qian of licorice, and four stalks of scallion, decocted for consumption.</p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh day of the ninth period, this corresponds to the numbers for March. Within a hundred days, the form of the fetus begins to distinguish between male and female, resembling the white fluff in clear mucus. The adult shape begins to appear, with male and female parts clearly defined. All parts can be faintly discerned, and this is referred to as the &quot;fetus.&quot; The active development of the fetus is guided by the Yang pathway of the Tai Chi for males and the Kun pathway for females, with the hands governed by the Shao Yin meridian&#39;s Fire. The fetus is most likely to show movement; the ancient Qian Zhi Tang or frequent consumption of pills is most effective.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there are no adverse signs or evidence, and if there are suspicions about the fetus, use the method of examination with one qian of Chuanxiong ground into powder, mixed with mugwort soup at dawn. If after taking it, there is no sensation of movement in the abdomen, it indicates a menstrual issue; if there is slight movement, it indicates pregnancy. If due to fright or anxiety the fetal energy is not in harmony and movement is difficult, causing pain in the abdomen and the navel, take two qian of warm wine and mix it with additional Angelica, which is especially clever. If the fetus is restless and there is unbearable pain in the lower back, use the ancient Du Xu Wan.</p>
<p>In the fourth month, when the gender is differentiated, the fetus begins to receive the essence of water to form blood vessels, and the shape is complete, the six organs develop in order, under the management of the Shao Yang channel. If there is a distended feeling in the abdomen, making it hard to digest food, a more severe condition can be treated with Ping Wei San, replacing Bai Zhu with Xiang Fu, Wu Yao, and Da Fu Pi. If due to fright or anger the fetus drops, causing pain in the lower abdomen extending to the waist and flank, with painful urination and blood, use the An Tai Dang Gui Tang.</p>
<p>In the fourth or fifth month, if there is sudden pain in the abdomen, use fourteen roasted black jujubes and one qian of salt burned red to powder, take a pinch, and mix it with wine to take for immediate relief.</p>
<p>In the fifth month, the fetus begins to receive the essence of fire to generate the yin-yang energy; the muscles and bones, as well as limbs, are formed, and hair begins to grow, governed by the Tai Yin channel.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nausea and Vomiting</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes there is severe vomiting, or at times, vomiting clear water. There is a strong aversion to food smells, due to the channels of the uterus connecting to the stomach. Thus, when food odor stimulates the vital energy, it rises. One must vomit the food completely for the vital energy to settle. There are also cases where the uterus is excessively dampened after intercourse, and this can resolve after more than a hundred days. </p>
<p>Treatment methods: If there is a lot of phlegm, use the Erchen Decoction with added bamboo shavings, ginger, and hot herbs like qin and lian. If vomiting occurs without an apparent cause, the left pulse is likely weak, and there may be headaches, with no food being taken; use the Eight-Specifics Decoction combined with Erchen Decoction plus roots and stems. For weakness of vitality, use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with added tangerine peel, mai men dong, hou po, and bamboo shavings. If there is a prolonged inability to ingest food and the person is vomiting clear water, add cloves. </p>
<p>If there is an aversion to food smells and the patient sleeps a lot and moves little, use xuan fu hua powder. For those suffering from nausea and vomiting for three to four months, especially with restless fetal movement or accompanying waist and abdomen pain, use a miscarriage-preserving drink. If there is also symptoms of malaria or dysentery with a loss of taste in the mouth, or a history of catching a cold, use the wake spleen drink. If there is injury from food, use Erchen Decoction with added sand ginger and xiang fu, or simply use white atractylodes in pill form, or sand ginger in powdered form, taken with rice drink; in severe cases, red pills are highly effective.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Child Disturbance</h3>
<p>Anxiety and restlessness during pregnancy, referred to as &quot;child disturbance.&quot; This often occurs between the fourth and fifth months of pregnancy when the maternal fire is active, or it may coincide with the heavenly decree in the months of May and June, when the ruling fire is strong. Both can affect the lungs, leading to restlessness and unsettled fetal movements. Generally, if the maternal fire is excessive, one should focus on the mother; take honey pills made with fox nuts, three pills with wine. For those who are not yet fully term and desire to give birth or experience difficulties in childbirth, this remedy is also effective. If the ruling fire is strong, use only Huanglian pills. For those whose spirits are unsettled, use Zhushā Anshen pills. If anxiety is severe and poses a risk to the fetus, employ the Zhaotai powder; it must not be treated with weak anxiety remedies. If there is phlegm or stagnant fluids trapped in the chest area causing restlessness and fetal movement issues, use a mixture of Poria, Fangfeng, and Mai Men Dong, adding a portion of Huangqin, with bamboo leaves reduced by half, boiled in water, and taken with bamboo juice.</p>
<h3>Child Suspended</h3>
<p>From the fourth to the fifth month of pregnancy, the nurturing fire affects the fetus, causing the fetal heat to rise and create fullness and pain in the chest and stomach, labeled as &quot;child suspended.&quot; This requires a Zisu drink. If there is significant chest fullness and distress, add a small amount of Curcuma and Clove. For those unable to eat, use the ancient Qinfang Decoction, which doubles the Bai Zhu and adds Chuanxiong. If the fire becomes excessively intense all at once, leading to extreme chest oppression and death, the Zisu drink should be continuously administered as a remedy. If there is accidental consumption of abortifacient drugs causing the fetus to die in utero, the ancient Qionguit Decoction can save the situation. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Prenatal care primarily focuses on stabilizing the fetus, adhering to ancient methods that avoid disturbing the stomach and the upper jiao. Disturbing the stomach refers to purging, affecting the upper jiao refers to inducing sweating, and disturbing the middle jiao refers to inducing vomiting. Sweating, vomiting, and purging should be avoided; instead, harmony and resolution are essential. The prenatal pill must include Bai Zhu and Huang Qin as the main ingredients for stabilizing the fetus. For common exterior pathogens, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction minus Ban Xia, adding Bai Zhu to combine with Si Wu Decoction, or with Si Jun Zi Decoction, as these best preserve the fetus and eliminate heat. For signs of cold damage, with Tai Yang syndrome, use Jiu Wei Qiang Huo Decoction combined with Si Wu Decoction; for Yang Ming syndrome, use Sheng Ma Ge Gen Decoction; for Shao Yang syndrome, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction; for Tai Yin syndrome, use Ping Wei San plus Bai Zhu and Zhi Shi; for heat, use Da Chai Hu Decoction plus Hou Pao and Dang Gui. For Shao Yin syndrome, use Ren Shen San Bai Decoction plus Dang Gui; for heat, use Liang Ge San. For Jue Yin syndrome, use Li Zhong Tang; for heat, use Liu Yi Shun Qi Decoction. All of the above should be taken with Si Wu Decoction. The remaining variations follow ancient methods. For exterior symptoms, use Xiong Su San, Gu Qiang Zhu Decoction, Qian Hu Qi Wu Decoction, or Huang Long Decoction. For summer heat damages, use Chai Hu Shi Gao Decoction. For vomiting, nausea, and fetal movement issues, use Mai Men Dong Decoction. For vomiting, loss of appetite, and irritability, use Lu Gen Decoction. For fever and irritability, use Sheng Ge Gen alone, decocted with water. For rashes, use Zhi Zi Da Qing Decoction or Sheng Ma Liu Wu Decoction. For mania, use Qin Jiao San. If there are fears of miscarriage due to extreme heat, apply Fuzhong Gan powder mixed with water to the navel and reapply when dry, stopping once the illness resolves. If the fetus has died, use Cong Chi Decoction or a decoction made with only scallions.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fetal Leakage</strong></p>
<p>Pain in the heart and abdomen with blood flow is considered fetal movement; blood flow without pain is considered fetal leakage. If the condition is hot, the blood flow will be abundant: if there is internal heat causing thirst, one should use Si Wu Decoction with additional Bai Zhu, Qin, Lian, and Yi Mu Cao, or Jin Gui&#39;s Dang Gui Powder, or modified Yang Rong Pill. If the blood is black and in chunks, use San Bu Wan with Xiang Fu and Bai Shao. If blood is deficient and comes in small amounts, use Gu Jiao Ai Tang or combine with Si Wu Decoction or Chang Tai Bai Zhu Wan. For Qi deficiency, employ Si Jun Zi Tang with additional Huang Qin and E Jiao; if labor and cold have led to Qi deficiency leading to blood flow and the sensation of falling, use Xiong Gui Bu Zhong Decoction. In some cases, if the blood flows like menstrual discharge causing damage to both fetus and mother, use Shou Di and fried Gan Jiang, each two qian, ground into powder and mixed with rice wine for consumption. There are also cases of women with a rich body, expecting menstrual flow, or who might be affected by a sudden cold when using the toilet. Even without medication, they may remain unharmed. However, treating fetal leakage immediately with harsh medicine may result in miscarriage. Only those who experience blood flow due to intercourse are genuinely experiencing fetal leakage; in such instances, use Ba Wu Decoction with added Jiao Ai for treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Urinary Blood</strong></p>
<p>Fetal leakage occurs with blood flow from the human door; urinary blood occurs with blood flow from the urinary door. During pregnancy, urinary blood is often due to heat in the womb. Use Si Wu Decoction with additional Shan Zhi and burnt ash, or a drink made with bitter dandelion is also effective. If it is due to heat from summer, use Yi Yuan San with Sheng Ma decoction. For slight deficiency, use Jiao Ai Si Wu Decoction.

For severe heat, use Wu Ling San. The cause is often internal injury from excessive sexual activity, resulting in weakness at the gate of the uterus.

<p><strong>Zhuan Bao</strong></p>
<p>During pregnancy, the bladder is pressed by the fetus, causing it to shift to one side, leading to obstruction of urinary pathways. Those with a weaker constitution, who are irritable and have a thick flavor, often experience this. The treatment is to elevate the fetus, allowing the bladder to open its waterway naturally. Use Si Wu Tang combined with Liu Jun Zi Tang, removing Fu Ling, and probe to lift the position; avoid the use of diuretics. Those with a history of being stout but suddenly losing weight, along with a pulse that is weak and weak on both sides, indicate Yang deficiency, treated with Shen Qi Wan.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Canon: A Treatise on Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Yu Tuan)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong>  </p>
<p>Someone asked: In pregnant women, some have regular menstruation while the fetus continues to grow; while others, after three to five months, experience heavy bleeding but do not miscarry. Some give birth on time, while others only give birth after the due date. What is the reason for this?  </p>
<p>It is said that those who have regular menstruation and whose fetuses continue to grow are referred to as having a &quot;strong fetus.&quot; This is because the woman has abundant blood and energy, which nourishes the fetus, leaving excess blood. For those with a fetus that has existed for months but experiences significant bleeding, it is termed a &quot;leaky fetus.&quot; This occurs due to impacts that disturb the Ren (Conception) vessel, causing bleeding without injuring the uterus.  </p>
<p>However, losing blood during pregnancy, even if the fetus does not miscarry, can deplete its energy and blood, leading to delayed labor. I have seen cases of giving birth after twelve or thirteen months, or even seventeen or eighteen months, or twenty-four or twenty-five months. In these instances, the cause is often insufficient blood and energy, making it difficult for the fetus to grow.  </p>
<p>Generally, if labor does not occur after ten months, one should take strong blood and energy replenishing medicines to nourish the mother, so that delivery may proceed without worry. Students of medicine must not overlook this.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Spirit Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: What is a woman with a spirit pregnancy? It was said: What one thinks during the day manifests as visions at night. For those who are lustful and empty, the mutual fires of the liver and kidneys can arise at any time, hence timid individuals often dream of engaging with spirits. What is termed a spirit pregnancy is actually a false pregnancy; it doesn’t result from an actual mingling with spirits. It is said in ancient texts that endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires lead to a state of white lust and murkiness; these flow into the uterus and form a spirit pregnancy. It arises from the woman&#39;s own blood and sexual essence, coalescing into a mass, causing her chest and abdomen to swell as if she were pregnant. What else could it be but a false pregnancy? </p>
<p>Some say: I have read in the medical work of Shi Bo Ren that a woman named Yang Tian Cheng, who was a temple priestess, while wandering the temple at dusk, felt her heart stir upon seeing a yellow-clad deity; that evening, she dreamt of interaction with this deity, and her belly gradually grew as if pregnant. She invited Shi Bo Ren to treat her, and upon diagnosis, he declared: This is a spirit pregnancy. The mother explained how it happened and took medicines for breaking blood to expel the pregnancy, administering about two liters, and was soon at ease. Isn’t this an encounter with a deity? It was replied: Such an incident may occur but follows no logical reasoning. How could physical forms interact and create essence to form a pregnancy? Alas! It is not that the deity deceives the woman, but rather the woman is deceived by the deity. It appears this woman, being older and without a husband, correlates with the idea of endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires. Those learned individuals should not be swayed by the confusion of heretical beliefs!<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Wang Kentang</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Abortion</strong>  </p>
<p>Mr. Yuan states: After conception, the fetus changes every seven days, and these changes are interdependent, each has its growth. Currently, many women have abortions at three months, five months, or seven months, while fewer occur at two, four, or six months. The organs are yin for the viscera and yang for the bowels; three months belong to the heart, five months to the spleen, and seven months to the lungs, all of which are linked to the pulses of the five organs. Yin is often easy to weaken, hence the prevalence of abortions. If in the past there was an abortion at three months, the heart pulse is injured and must be regulated first; otherwise, it may lead to another abortion at three months. If there has been an abortion at five months, the spleen pulse is wounded, and after this, an abortion may occur again at five months, so it is advisable to treat the spleen first. If a miscarriage occurs within one month, the woman may not even be aware of her pregnancy, only that she is not pregnant and does not realize she was pregnant and then lost the fetus. One month pertains to the liver; if anger occurs, it may lead to a miscarriage. Also, frequent washing of the lower body can open the channels and lead to abortion. If there has been one miscarriage, the liver pulse is damaged, and subsequent miscarriages may follow. Nowadays, many childless couples have seen miscarriages at one month; it does not mean they are entirely infertile. Therefore, after the initial intercourse, it is most advisable to rest, avoiding further engagement that may disturb the womb, to avoid anger, exertion, heavy lifting, and bathing. Moreover, one should take herbs that nourish the liver and balance the qi to secure the fetus.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Division of Forms in Relation to Gender</strong></p>
<p>Cheng Mingqian states: Zhu Cheng remarks that in the union of man and woman, the essence of yin blood arrives first, followed by the yang essence which then leads to the formation of a male; whereas if the yang essence enters first and the blood follows, a female is formed. This statement is indeed credible. There are instances where a person has their essence released first leading to the birth of a male, and released later leading to a female, so why is that? Dongyuan says: If the menstruation has just ceased for one or two days, and the blood sea begins to clear, then a conception will lead to a male; if four or five days later, when the blood vessels are already vigorous, conception will lead to a female. After six or seven days, even if there is a union, it will not lead to conception. This statement is also credible, as there are cases where a person conceives a female shortly after menstruation ceases, and conceives a male after a prolonged interruption.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are instances where one has intercourse four or five days prior with no conception, yet experiences conception eight or nine days later; what could be the reason for this? Yu Zi Mu, in his work &quot;Essentials of Conception,&quot; asserts that the strong Yang can enter the receptive Yin, while the strong Yin cannot receive Yang, as explained by the views of the Eastern Garden. He further states that a slight Yang cannot penetrate the Yin, and a weak Yin cannot grasp the Yang. </p>
<p>This is indeed believable; there are men who are frail and women who are timid, often becoming pregnant repeatedly, despite their desires to prevent it, while others, endowed with robust vitality and outstanding essence, struggle significantly to conceive, with no remedy available for them. What could be the reason for this? </p>
<p>Zhu Danxi emphasizes that treatment should focus primarily on a woman&#39;s menstrual cycle. However, in wealthy families with many concubines, surely some of them must have menstruation during the appropriate time? There are also cases where a woman has already borne children frequently with a previous husband, yet marrying another in hopes of ease, but still fails to conceive; instead, she sends the child to another man, hoping for a male heir. Can it be that she cannot conceive with one yet can with another? </p>
<p>I believe that the birth of children from parents is akin to the birth of beings in the universe, as the &quot;I Ching&quot; states, the receptive (Kun) way follows heaven and operates according to the timing.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

Indeed, when we speak of value being attributed to men, it does not depend on age, strength, health, or ease of retention. It only requires that when the time of union occurs, the hundred channels are in harmony, which is optimal. When there is harmony in the hundred channels at the time of union, even if one is old or weak, ill or easy to leak, conception can still occur. Conversely, when there is discord in the hundred channels, even if one is young or strong, healthy or difficult to leak, conception becomes challenging. The blood produced by women does derive from the harmonious gathering of the hundred channels; compared to a man&#39;s essence, there is inevitably a distinction in importance.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Confucius said: Great is the principle of the cosmos, from which all things begin; profound is the principle of the earth, from which all things are born. Is there no intention in this? The distinction between male and female is not restricted by the timing of conception or by the state of the parents, whether the father is strong and the mother weak, or the mother is strong and the father weak. It is determined solely by the proper flow of essence and blood through the hundred channels. Thus, when the essence flows through the channels and overpowers the blood, a male is formed; when the blood flows through the channels and overpowers the essence, a female is formed. Additionally, there are those who conceive but suffer miscarriage, those who give birth yet remain childless, those who nurture yet do not live long, and those who live long but have no offspring. This illustrates the variability of essence and blood in terms of strength and fragility. People in the world do not see how the strength and fragility of essence and blood, which are determined from the very beginning, lead them to wrongly assign blame for miscarriage to the mother, infertility to the son, and mortality to fate. Is this not a mistake?</p>

<p>Regarding abdominal abscess in pregnant women, the treatment is quite different from ordinary methods.

<p>Regarding the method to change a girl into a boy, when a couple conceives, the differentiation of yin and yang occurs.

Although by the third month the male and female forms are differentiated, with the yang essence prevailing for boys and the yin blood for girls, during the first two months the essences are mixed, and the characteristics of male and female have not yet manifested. By the third month, the distinctions of yin and yang begin to become clear, and therefore it is said they are separate. This initial reception of essence determines the outcome; it does not mean that the forms of yin and yang were initially unclear.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Abortion</strong></p>
<p>Those who suffer from frequent miscarriages during pregnancy are influenced by men’s indulgence and women’s desires, combined with a preference for spicy and hot foods, which damage the body’s balance, leading to the risk of miscarriage. Women who indulge without regard for their condition often have varying degrees of desire. There are some women who appear pregnant but are not; they experience symptoms like phlegm, pain, and fever. If a physician fails to understand the pulse and misapplies depletive and antipyretic remedies, unaware that fetal energy should be nurtured while disease energy should be countered, it would be a grave mistake to use aggressive medications for those who are pregnant. Hence, nourishing the fetus relies on blood, while protecting it depends on vital energy. Some women have too many miscarriages, and upon reaching middle age, they try to find ways to take medications to maintain their pregnancies, yet if their desires do not cease and their temperament remains unchanged, it leads to respiratory issues that harm the body, which may result in death. Therefore, ancient scholars noted that birds incubate eggs, and mammals carry young—if even creatures can protect their progeny, how can humans, as the pinnacle of creation, fail to do so?</p>
<p><strong>Suspension of the Fetus</strong></p>
<p>The five organs are all connected to the heart, and the heart connects back to the five organs. Thus, the gates of the womb connect to the heart. When fetal energy is harmonious, it remains calm and unmoving; when it is not harmonious, it stretches and moves, pulling on its connections, causing heart pain, resembling the condition of something suspended and falling, termed “suspension of the fetus.”</p>
<p><strong>Fetal Distress</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of fetal distress are all related to heat, which can be either deficient or excess. It is necessary to differentiate the twelve meridians to nourish the fetus during the months, treating each according to its organ&#39;s condition.

<p><strong>Typhoid Fever</strong></p>
<p>When a pregnant woman has typhoid fever, the focus should be on clearing heat and stabilizing the fetus for the sake of life.

Even today, pregnant women often do not fully rely on medicines seeking for a good delivery. After all, childbirth is a normal aspect of womanhood and does not require medication as if one were ill. However, those with a history of difficult labor must seek remedies as a plan to safeguard their lives. The methods for supporting a fetus differ; for those with phlegm due to excess qi, Zhi Ke Shou Tai San and talc are suitable. For those with qi deficiency and slight heat, Da Sheng San and Shu Tai Wan are appropriate. If one does not carefully assess their deficiency or excess, it is better to abstain from taking any medicine.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Pregnancy Before Conception</strong></p>
<p>The joy of the tremorous wind has its signs, and the pulse of pregnancy must be precise. The measures are slippery at the inch, but abundant at the length; the yang strikes the yin and brings excitement. Although the spirit is weary, the peach-like cheeks are more beautiful; although food is initially distasteful, the heavenly essence does not fall. There is no harm in evil obstructions, yet one must beware of the impurities that cause miscarriage. Heat must be cleared, and the spleen cannot be weak. If heat is not cleared, the fetus will be restless; if the spleen is deficient, the fetus is prone to falling. The foundation is ensuring the stability of the fetus; other mixed conditions are secondary treatments. These are the maxims of the ancients, to be adhered to by future generations.</p>
<p>If the child hangs too low causing urgent pain, do not doubt. If the child suddenly has convulsions, it is indeed alarming. If the child is full and the fetus is fat, there may be excessive qi; if the child suffers from chills and the spleen is weak, there may be insufficient qi. If there is agitation or painful urination, it is due to heat in the fetus; if there is swelling or gas, it is caused by water from the fetus. If there is coughing or dysentery, the illness worsens and harms the fetus; whether due to cold or food disorders, phlegm becomes bitter and harmful. If constantly mournful or laughing, the lung&#39;s qi is stagnated, not a calamity; if one becomes suddenly mute, the heart&#39;s blood is deficient and no medication is needed. If the fetus is heavy yet thin, the rapid progress should be closely monitored, and the pulse must not be misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>After the embryo forms, prohibitions must not be violated; before labor, caution is essential. Prepare medicines and select a capable midwife carefully. Avoid noisy doubts, as they may disturb a mother’s heart; maintain calm and quiet, allowing the mother’s qi to harmonize. If the child&#39;s body has not turned, it is not advisable to sit on the grass too early; once the amniotic fluid has broken, excessive force should also be avoided.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nurturing the Fetus</p>
<p>After a woman conceives, it is most important to regulate her diet, favoring light and bland flavors, avoiding cold and hot climates, and constantly obtaining pure and peaceful qi to nurture the fetus. This ensures a strong and stable fetal essence, leading to a healthy birth. Nowadays, women tend to indulge in spicy, sour, fried, fatty, sweet, and cold foods, unaware they should restrain their appetites. This harms the spleen and stomach, making it easier for the fetus to miscarry, as the mingling of cold and heat leads to many ailments in the child. Moreover, excessive sourness harms the liver, excess bitterness harms the heart, too much sweetness harms the spleen, and excess spiciness harms the lungs. An overabundance of salt can harm the kidneys, as the foods consumed can injure the vital organs and affect blood, qi, muscles, and bones, leading to the child&#39;s diseases. After conception, one must exercise great caution regarding feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Excessive joy can harm the heart and disperse energy; anger can injure the liver and raise energy upward; prolonged thinking can damage the spleen and cause energy stagnation; worry can hurt the lungs and lead to energy blockage; fear can affect the kidneys and lower energy. When maternal energy is harmed, the child’s energy corresponds to it, and there is none without injury. If the mother is harmed, miscarriage may easily occur; if the child is harmed, the internal energies will be uncoordinated, leading to many illnesses. Blindness, deafness, muteness, insanity, and seizures are all due to improper reception of energies.</p>
<p>After a woman conceives, she should not remain in one position for too long while standing, sitting, or lying down, as prolonged actions can harm her muscles and bones; the child in her womb shares energy with the mother, and there will surely be injury. If one engages in excessive passion during intercourse and the child is born with a white membrane on the head, sticky like glue, it is commonly referred to as being born with a &quot;white cap,&quot; which is indeed a sign of the connection between mother and child.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Child Fullness</h3>
<p>When a pregnant woman reaches seven or eight months, the fetus grows large, the abdomen becomes distended, pressing against the childbirth channel, causing discomfort when sitting or lying down. This condition is called &#39;child fullness,&#39; and is treated with the Binding the Fetus Decoction.</p>
<h3>External Diseases</h3>
<p>For a pregnant woman suffering from a sore throat, use the Eastern Garden Cool Diaphragm Powder with one qian of roasted beef seed ground fine. For mouth and tongue ulcers during pregnancy, the Eastern Garden Cool Diaphragm Powder is the primary treatment. Pregnant women often develop breast abscesses; in that case, the Exorcise Toxin Decoction is indicated. If sores or toxins appear on the back, this is related to the Yangming channel. Modify the original formula by removing the green peel and adding one qian each of Cimicifuga and Kudzu root. If sores or toxins appear on the cheeks or chest, this is related to the Shaoyang channel. Modify the original formula by removing the Angelica dahurica and adding Chai Hu, Dan Cao, and Gardenia fruit. For sores or toxins under the shoulder and axilla, which involve the Taiyin channel, remove the green peel from the original formula and add one qian each of dried tangerine peel, Platycodon, mulberry bark, and Asparagus root. For sores or toxins near the inner thighs and genitals, which pertain to the Jueyin channel, remove the Angelica dahurica and double the green peel. For sores or toxins on the palms and soles, concerning the Shaoyin channel, modify the original formula by removing Angelica dahurica, green peel, and Chinese yam powder, and adding one qian each of Huang Lian, Huang Bo, and Mu Tong.</p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When there is a fetus of both genders, there will be distinctions in the timing of its development; when there are both yin and yang, the orientation of the fetus can vary. A male fetus moves at three months, as yang is early; a female fetus moves at five months, as yin is late. A female fetus is positioned with its back to the mother, which is why the mother’s abdomen is soft; a male fetus is positioned facing the mother, resulting in a hard abdomen. This is all based on reason and should be observed.</p>
<p>In general, if the fetal energy during pregnancy is unstable, the causes are not the same, and the treatment should also differ. The instability of fetal energy must have a cause, whether it be deficiency or excess, cold or heat; all can lead to issues with the fetal energy. Eliminating the source of the problem is the method for stabilizing the pregnancy. Therefore, the methods for stabilizing pregnancy should not be rigid, nor should they be limited to specific months; rather, they should be adapted according to the symptoms and conditions presented, treating the ailment with appropriate remedies, which is the best approach. If one considers baizhu and huangqin to be the ultimate remedies for stabilizing pregnancy and insists on using them, it is rarely without error.</p>
<p>If the fetal energy is unstable due to cold, symptoms may include sour regurgitation, nausea and fullness, preference for warmth, and aversion to coolness. Symptoms may also include cold diarrhea, a pulse that is deep and thin, or no heat signs at all while the fetus is unstable, which all denote a deficiency of yang and cold symptoms. To remedy this, one should warm the interior to stabilize the fetus. It is advisable to use warming stomach drinks or formulas that regulate yin, adding or subtracting ingredients as needed. One should also consider the usual condition of the internal organs when deciding on treatment.</p>
<p>If the fetal energy is unstable due to heat, the symptoms will likely include much restlessness and heat, thirst, or agitation, unclear sensations above and below, blood leakage or red urine, or a slippery and rapid pulse among other signs. For these cases, one should primarily use cooling fetal drinks or formulas that nourish yin.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For those with heat but not deficiency, remedies like Zhiqiao soup, Yimother pills, and Huangqin powder can be selected to clear the heat and stabilize the fetus. In cases where the fetal energy is deficient and unstable, it is particularly challenging to regulate. Here, there are congenital and acquired deficiencies, both of which are critical to the fetal essence. Congenital deficiencies are due to inherited constitution and should be gradually nurtured according to their Yin and Yang tendencies—one must not rush, seeking preservation. Acquired deficiencies arise from human affairs; all forms of desires, fatigue, dietary excesses, and emotional disturbances can harm the fetal essence. The treatment should focus on understanding the underlying causes and adjusting accordingly with caution. Nonetheless, overall, it pertains to the deficiency of blood and Qi, so the focus should be on the Fetal Essence Decoction. If there is deficiency in the heart and spleen Qi, remedies like Xiaoyao drink, Guizhi soup, and Shoupi decoction should be employed. If the liver and kidney are insufficient below, Left and Right Gui drinks should be used, adapting with Yin tonics. In cases where both Qi and blood are deficient, remedies like Wufu drink, Bachen soup, and Shiquan Dabu soup are appropriate. If there is a deficiency of spleen and kidney Qi accompanied by turbidity, remedies like Miyuan decoction and Tusi decoction should be applied. For excessive vomiting and nausea, it is advisable to combine the previously suggested formulas with Erchen decoction to harmonize. In general, when treating deficiency syndromes, flexibility in response is crucial, as there are no absolute rules.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The presence of excess and stagnant qi can cause discomfort and fullness. This usually arises when the foundational energy is not deficient, but may be obstructed by stagnation. If one observes the causes and addresses them appropriately, treating these issues is not difficult. For persistent vomiting, the Er Chen Decoction with added bitter orange peel and cardamom is effective, or one can use the Ginseng and Tangerine Peel Decoction, which is also excellent. For food stagnation causing fullness and discomfort, the Xiao He Zhong Decoction with modifications is indicated. If liver qi is stagnant, causing reverse flow and discomfort, the Jie Gan Decoction is effective. If anger provokes liver qi along with heat, the Hua Gan Decoction should be used. For spleen and lung qi stagnation resulting in pain, the Zisu Decoction is advisable. If there is qi stagnation with phlegm, the Si Qi Decoction or Er Chen Decoction with added Angelica is suitable. If qi stagnation is accompanied by heat leading to fullness and agitation, the Bitter Orange Decoction or similar remedies should be prescribed. Wang Jiezai said: In caring for pregnant women, it is essential to clear heat and nourish the blood. White Atractylodes tonifies the spleen and is the chief herb for maintaining a stable pregnancy, while the combination with Huang Qin serves as a holy remedy due to its heat-clearing properties, especially during the hot months. This view, while seemingly rational, must be discerned in the face of significant illness. The qi of the fetus must align with the mother&#39;s organ qi.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Generally, those with yin deficiency tend to have excess heat; those with yang deficiency tend to have excess cold. If they can feel cold, they are cold; if they can feel heat, they are hot—this is what we call balanced qi. Now, if we say among ten people, three are cold, three are hot, and four are balanced, this is the general comparison. If one claims that after conception internal heat must increase, differing from ordinary individuals, how can we treat those suffering from adverse conditions without using ingredients like Er Chen San, Liu Jun Zi, fresh ginger, and half summer, which undoubtedly increase heat? Therefore, for treating heat, Huangqin is appropriate, but it is not suitable for cold. Not only is it unsuitable for those who are cold, but also for those with balanced qi. Indeed, among today&#39;s pregnant women, there are few with abundant qi and many with qi deficiency. Qi deficiency leads to yang deficiency, and if Huangqin is used again, some may suffer from adverse effects, and even if they do not feel it at the time, it can harm the fetal essence and weaken the mother&#39;s qi, resulting in frailty after childbirth or an increase in the child’s spleen-related illnesses, often due to this. Yet, people today cannot perceive this principle but instead regard the phrase &quot;sacred medicine&quot; as essential to use for pregnant women, regardless of an individual&#39;s yin or yang strength, believing that all medicines for maintaining pregnancy must be used, which can indeed be quite harmful. As for Baizhu, while it is good for stabilizing pregnancy, it may not always work well if used improperly, due to its nature of being drying and qi-constricting. Therefore, for those with yin deficiency, it should not be used alone, and for those with qi stagnation, it should be used judiciously. Thus, the difficulty in prescribing medicine should be like arranging beads—one cannot be rigid in rules while playing music.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Aversion to Food</strong>  </p>
<p>For pregnant women, it is common to experience nausea and vomiting, along with a feeling of fullness and inability to eat. However, the causes of these symptoms vary in nature and should be diagnosed and treated accordingly. Generally, aversion to food is often due to a deficiency in the stomach and qi stagnation. However, it can also occur in women who are not originally deficient but suddenly conceive, resulting in obstruction of the qi from ascending, leading to symptoms like nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, why do these symptoms gradually diminish after three months? This is because, as the fetus grows larger, the energy of the organs is primarily devoted to supporting the fetal energy, thus leaving little room for upward obstructions.  </p>
<p>In treating this condition, it is advisable to use formulas like Banxia Fuling Decoction or Renshen Guo Pi Decoction to adjust and gradually calm the situation, ensuring treatment is maintained until the right time for recovery. If there is phlegm in the central abdomen, use Erchen Decoction with Zhike, or rely on Banxia Fuling Decoction. For dietary stagnation causing bloating, a mild Diarrhea Remedy should be modified accordingly. If qi rises and causes a feeling of fullness, use Banxia Fuling Decoction with Zhike, perilla stem, and xiangfu. For deficiency in spleen and stomach qi, utilize formulas such as Wuwei Yigong San, Liu Junzi Decoction, or Renshen Guo Pi Decoction. When there is significant vomiting due to stomach deficiency and cold, use Liuweidihuang Decoction or Warm Stomach Decoction. If vomiting is due to yang deficiency of the liver and kidneys, management should focus on addressing the underlying yin deficiency.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fetal Leakage</strong></p>
<p>When a pregnant woman experiences unstable menstrual flow, it is called fetal leakage. The causes of fetal leakage can arise from either fetal energy or pathological energy, and the influences on fetal energy can also be divided into two categories. I once diagnosed a woman whose pulse was slippery and rapid, without any signs of wind-heat or other illnesses. Upon inquiring about her menstrual flow, it appeared mostly normal but slightly reduced compared to before. I concluded that she must be pregnant, as the fetus was small while her blood volume was considerable. After three months, her menstrual flow ceased, and she successfully gave birth to a boy. Therefore, many pregnant women exhibit similar conditions. It is common to see women delivering babies after seven or eight months, but as long as the blood flow stops, it is deemed premature. However, the conception occurred before the flow ceased, which is something people generally do not understand. Even in cases of fetal energy, there are distinctions in the balance of Yin and Yang. If the mother’s energy is strong and the Yin of the fetus is abundant, leading to excess blood overflow, although the blood may leak, the child will not be weak; this illustrates the strength of Yin and does not necessarily require treatment.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the paternal Qi is weak and the fetus cannot fully receive it, while there is a loss of blood, it results in both essence and blood being depleted, leading to a child that will inevitably be weak and small; this is a decline of Yang, which is also not well understood by people. All of this originates from the prenatal aspect, where there is nothing that can provide strength. However, nurturing the roots, can it truly have no method of adjustment? It can be seen that the transition from absence to presence and strengthening the weak hands is not easily achieved, making it not something to be discussed lightly. As for losses due to illness, they can only be treated by addressing the illness itself. For instance, if there is a loss from heat in the blood, one should use Baoyin Decoction or Qinghua Drink accordingly. If anger stirs liver fire causing blood loss, Baoyin Decoction should be used; for severe cases, Huagan Decoction is indicated. If the spleen is deficient and cannot hold the blood, then Shoupi Decoction or four gentlemen formula should be used. For spleen deficiency with blood heat and Qi stagnation, the Four Holy Powder is appropriate. If both the spleen and kidneys are deficient, then Wuyin Decoction is indicated. For simultaneous deficiency of Qi and blood in the Sanjiao, Wufu Drink or Qifu Drink may be used. If fatigue and labor cause blood movement, Shoupi Decoction or Guipi Decoction is advised. If blood loss occurs due to an accidental injury, Wufu Drink or An Tai Powder should be used. When there is Qi deficiency in the Chong and Ren Channels leading to blood being slippery and easily movable, Guding Decoction or Miyuan Decoction should be applied.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Sudden Blood Loss</p>
<p>When a woman experiences sudden blood loss during pregnancy, there are four possible conditions: it may be due to heat causing the blood to move abnormally, or due to anger obstructing the qi and stirring the blood, or due to trauma affecting the fetal energy and injuring the uterus, or due to the weakness of the spleen and kidneys leading to instability at the gate of life which causes blood loss. All of these are severe instances of blood movement; if not treated promptly, they will certainly lead to miscarriage. </p>
<p>In addressing this issue, one must first assess the quantity of blood lost and what happens afterward. It is particularly important to examine the severity of the pathological factors. If heat remains, one should still clear the heat; if the qi is not yet harmonized, one should also remedy the qi. If the blood moves due to pathogenic factors and the loss leads to a deficiency of vitality, one must prioritize nourishing the original qi to prevent further loss. Treatment may involve addressing either the symptoms or the root cause, or combining both approaches to restore balance. </p>
<p>If one is unclear about the order of treatment or the urgency, there is a risk that symptomatic treatment will be addressed before the root cause is attended to. Therefore, a thorough investigation is necessary. If the blood movement is caused by intense heat, one must evaluate the degree of heat; if mild, a cooling elixir for the fetus may be given, if slightly more severe, a warming decoction may be appropriate, and if extremely severe, one should use Baoyin Decoction or Ziqin Powder. If there is wind-heat in the liver channel causing blood loss, one should employ Fenghuangqing Pill for protection. If anger has harmed the liver, causing qi stagnation and sudden blood movement, then Baoyin Decoction is advisable.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the fetal energy during pregnancy is disturbed, the signs can range from slight restlessness in movement to minor bleeding.

However, if there are abdominal pains with significant bleeding, and symptoms such as lower back pain and a feeling of heaviness indicate a serious risk of loss, using the Juejin decoction or Wuwu decoction to aid in expelling the blood is the most appropriate course of action. </p>

If there is unresponsive distention and prompt action is necessary, urgently use Pingwei powder, one tael, with half a share of wine and water, decocted and taken hot with five qian of Glauber&#39;s salt; or take one tael of Glauber’s salt mixed with child&#39;s urine.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Miscarriage</p>
<p>A fetus is conceived through the union of the male and female principles, with vital energy flowing and blood following. If nourishment is administered smoothly and in harmony, a birth will occur at the proper time. However, if there are interruptions in this nourishing process, the continuity of its source is disrupted, and the fetus cannot remain secure. This can be likened to someone planting seeds: if the necessary moisture is insufficient, they will wither and fall away. Thus, it is said in the Great Treatise on the Five Constants: what is rooted internally is termed the &quot;spiritual mechanism&quot;; when the spirit departs, the mechanism ceases. What is rooted externally is termed &quot;established energy&quot;; when energy halts, transformation ceases. This is exactly what is meant.</p>
<p>Whenever there are cases of miscarriage during pregnancy, it is always due to the depletion of energy channels. The reasons for this depletion can vary: some individuals may be naturally weak, some may be advanced in age and debilitated, some may suffer from worry, anger, or fatigue that exhausts their vitality, and some may recklessly indulge in desires that harm their life force. Furthermore, external factors like falls or improper diet can also injure these energy channels. If the energy channels are damaged, it is unlikely for a fetus to survive unless it possesses an exceptionally strong and resilient constitution. The average person does not have this capacity. </p>
<p>Moreover, a pregnancy lasts ten months and requires careful nurturing; hence, those who frequently experience miscarriages often do so between the third and fifth or seventh months. Subsequent miscarriages will likely happen similarly at the same intervals because the previous injury to the energy channels renders them incapable of sustaining the pregnancy again at the subsequent time.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, a woman’s kidneys are connected to the womb, and the waist is considered the organ of the kidneys. Therefore, pregnant women are particularly prone to back pain; if the pain is severe, it may lead to miscarriage, which cannot be ignored. Thus, those who fear miscarriage must understand the reasons for such injuries and take careful precautions. In treating miscarriages, one must understand the source of nourishing the fetus and proactively compensate for any losses. The methods for preserving pregnancy are fundamentally based on this; waiting until the time is near might leave one without recourse.</p>
<p>In general, an unstable pregnancy stems from damage to the vital energy (qi) and blood. When qi is deficient, it cannot uphold the pregnancy, and when blood is deficient, it fails to nourish properly, often resulting in miscarriages. Therefore, those skilled in preserving pregnancies must focus on addressing blood deficiency, primarily using the Fetal Vitality Decoction and adjusting its components; next is the Peony and Chuanxiong Decoction; then there is the Mount Tai Stone Powder, or the Qianjin Fetal Preservation Pills, both of which have the power to assist natural processes and should be used judiciously.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever there is heat in the pregnancy, the blood easily becomes agitated. When the blood is in motion, the fetus is unstable, thus it is common for those with internal heat and deficiency to experience this. If one has spleen deficiency and heat in the blood, the Four Saints Powder is recommended. If there is liver and kidney deficiency with blood heat, a Cooling Fetal Drink is suggested. If there is liver and spleen deficiency with blood heat, a Stabilizing Fetus Decoction should be used. Furthermore, if there are other conditions leading to fetal instability, one should refer to the guidelines for pregnancy preservation and treat accordingly.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

<p>The essence of a fetus during pregnancy fundamentally relies on the qualities of blood and qi. If the fetus does not grow, it is simply due to a deficiency of blood and qi. Thus, those who experience continuous bleeding after conception do so because blood does not return to nourish the fetus. Some women in middle age find their blood and qi weakening, akin to a spring that gradually runs dry. Women suffering from numerous digestive issues will have a diminished source of nourishment, leading to insufficient support for the channels. Women who often experience frustration and anger may have their liver qi in rebellion, resulting in an improper balance of blood that fails to adequately support the fetus. Occasionally, insufficient growth may stem from cold blood and qi, indicating weakened yang, which results in a lack of vitality. Conversely, overheating blood may impede growth, as excessive fire harms the true yin. For all these conditions, nourishment and strengthening, warmth and clarity should be considered, responding appropriately to the specific ailment; thus, if timed well, growth may occur, or even if delayed, as the fetal essence gradually accumulates, growth will naturally resume.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ghostly Fetus</strong></p>
<p>The notion of a ghostly fetus among women is not simply an empty illusion; can it truly invade a person&#39;s womb and take shape? This phenomenon arises primarily from the woman&#39;s own weakness in constitution or from accumulated unhealthy thoughts, leading to blood stagnation. When there is an obstruction in the channels, the flow of qi and blood is hindered, representing an internal ailment rather than an external evil influence. It pertains more to symptoms of blood stagnation and qi blockage, which should be treated accordingly. Additionally, encounters with fox spirits or similar entities do have an impact, but they should not be confused with the concept of a ghostly fetus; instead, they too must be addressed through methods related to stagnation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cases of ghostly fetus illness typically involve insufficient blood and qi compounded by stagnation. If one finds their menstrual cycle irregular and begins to nourish and rectify, they are unlikely to suffer this ailment. However, if they are already afflicted, treatment should focus on restoring the fundamental qi first, followed by remedies to eliminate stagnation. For gentle assistance alongside nourishment, there is nothing better than the Juejin Decoction. If one wishes to remove blockage without harshness, the Tongyu Decoction is most suitable. When one aims to address the ailment directly after supplementary treatment, both the Duoming Dan and the Huisheng Dan are worth considering. Alternatively, a concentrated broth of Angelica and safflower with red gold beans also works remarkably well.<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Pregnancy and Moderation of Desires</h3>
<p>Pregnant women should greatly limit their desires. There is much that women may not know, and men also may be ignorant, bordering on foolishness. The strength or weakness of the fetus, the ease or difficulty of childbirth, and the post-natal issues such as hemorrhage and irregularities in the menstrual cycle—all are fundamentally influenced by this. The reason is that during the time of fetal development, it is essential to protect the womb and refrain from excessive desires, which can cause the loss of vital energy. If the defenses are weak, injuries can occur; if the blood and energy do not coalesce properly, chaos ensues; and if the vital essence is depleted, the offspring may perish prematurely, and ailments of the reproductive system will also arise from this. This is paramount for women to exercise caution; those who are wise must take heed.</p>
<h3>Medicine and Nutrition</h3>
<p>For women with both blood and energy deficiency, irregular menstrual flow, and who are unable to conceive, the most effective remedy is to appropriately regulate the use of Yu Lin Zhi (a traditional tonic). Following that, Ba Zhen Yi Mu Wan (Eight Treasures and Nourishing Mother Pills) is also good. If there is severe stagnation due to coldness in the organs, using Xu Si Jiang Sheng Dan (a tonic for fertility) is also effective.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All conception in men and women ultimately depends on the state of blood and qi. When blood and qi are harmonious and abundant, there is no case of inability to conceive; those conceived will grow without exception. Those unable to conceive are simply weak in qi and blood; those that do not thrive are due to unstable foundations. Just as various illnesses compound, it all stems from damage to blood and qi. If any evil or countercurrent remains, one should simply use decoctions to slightly correct the imbalance. After correcting, the primary focus must be on harmonizing qi and blood, which is the best approach for a complete remedy.</p>
<p>Thus, in using seeds, pills, or powders, one must not mix them with drugs that disperse wind, eliminate phlegm, or any cold and harsh medicines. For any long-term medications, if combined with such types, over time they will increase qi but ultimately injure qi and blood, making conception difficult. As for Xiangfu (Cyperus rotundus), it is said by Wang Haogu to be an elixir for women, and frequent use can move qi. However, in later generations, it is not discussed in terms of regulating qi, but rather is passed down as an essential medicine for women, applied indiscriminately without consideration for deficiency or excess.</p>
<p>What is overlooked is that Xiangfu, being aromatic with a pungent and dry nature, is primarily for relieving stagnation, dispersing qi, moving blood, and guiding away obstructions. If used for qi deficiency, it can greatly deplete qi; if used for blood deficiency, it can significantly deplete blood. Like the ancient formula for the Ladies’ Golden Pill and the various Xiangfu pills, they should only be used when there is substantial qi and stagnant blood. Yet, among contemporary women, nine out of ten are deficient—can such an important medicine be used indiscriminately? Improper use will gradually weaken them, and the vital force for conception will inevitably fade away.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></p></div>

<p>The condition of &quot;Zihuan&quot; (suspended fetus) is characterized by heat in the womb, causing the fetus to be restless and attempting to rise within the amniotic sac, resembling a suspended state; in reality, it is not the fetus that can hang. If one uses strong qi to push downward, it could lead to death. The prescription consists of two qian of ginseng and poria, five qian of white atractylodes and white peony, three qian of yellow quino and raw earth, one qian of eucommia, one liang of cooked earth, and two qian of angelica, all boiled in water for consumption. This formula is solely a divine medicine for benefiting the waist and navel; if one adds a bit of yellow quino to clear it, the fetus will stabilize with the cold. Moreover, the formula is rich in nourishment while lacking excessive coldness, ensuring stability in crisis, with profound meaning within. The fetus is connected between the waist and kidneys, while the amniotic sac is tied at the ren and chong points; hence, the herbs directly enter the internal meridians, solidifying the foundation, causing the fetus to desire movement yet unable to. Especially with the use of heat-clearing herbs, could there be instability below?</p>
<p><strong>Loutai</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Loutai&quot; (threatened miscarriage) is due to insufficient qi and blood. It is urgent to use strong supplements to prevent miscarriage. The formula consists of two qian of ginseng, cornelian cherry, yam, and poria; five qian of white atractylodes and cooked earth; one qian of eucommia, goji berries, angelica, and licorice; three qian of ophiopogon; and five fen of northern five-flavor fruit, all boiled in water for consumption. This formula is neither cold nor hot, a divine medicine for stabilizing the fetus. For anyone experiencing instability in pregnancy, this formula has miraculous effects in calming it. The movements of the fetus are influenced by the exuberance of the parents. Now, by supplementing qi and blood, it naturally stabilizes, so how could there be a risk of miscarriage? Alternatively, one may use the black and white formula for stabilizing the fetus.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fetal Movement</strong></p>
<p>Fetal movement indicates the risk of miscarriage. It should be treated beforehand, and the results are invariably remarkable. Some use the Stop Miscarriage Elixir, which is often more effective than the medicinal herbs meant to stabilize pregnancy. In discussing this, it is said that fetal movement signifies heat, while lack of movement signifies cold. For heat, one should use Huangqin; for cold, Sha Ren. If both heat and cold are present, both Sha Ren and Huangqin should be used. The world does not recognize the balance of heat and cold, mistakenly considering Huangqin and Sha Ren as the only sacred medicines for stabilizing pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Miscarriage</strong></p>
<p>The signs of miscarriage do not occur before delivery, yet they do not align with regular childbirth signs, and should therefore be treated as pre-delivery complications. If someone miscarries without a full delivery, it is termed a miscarriage. Even though there may not be the significant void of a complete delivery, both Qi and blood are still greatly harmed. It is urgent to replenish them to prevent future miscarriages. Use five qian of Ren Shen, Dang Gui, and Bai Zhu; three qian of Fu Ling; one liang of Shu Di; two qian of Du Zhong; and five fen of Pao Jiang, decocted in water for consumption. This formula is indeed a sacred recipe for replenishing Qi and blood. As the fetus moves downward, it will inevitably harm the Dai Mai (a type of meridian), but by replenishing the Qi and blood, the damage to this meridian can regenerate. Consequently, in future pregnancies, there should be no risk of further harm.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a></p></div>

<p>There should be no discharge before childbirth.

One should use three portions of black beans to brew two bowls of soup. First, take one bowl, add ten ginkgo nuts, twenty red dates, one tael of cooked rehmannia, and four qian each of cornelian cherries, coix seeds, and Chinese yam, along with three qian of poria and two qian each of alisma and moutan root.

<p><strong>Pregnancy and Cold from the Shaoyin</strong></p>
<p>When a pregnant woman is nearing her term and suddenly feels cold due to wind evil affecting the Shaoyin channel, curling up with cold hands and feet, this is not a treatable condition. The Shaoyin is associated with the kidney channel. Whether the evil affects the channel from the Shaoyin or goes directly into the Shaoyin, if it gives this indication, it is often hard to treat. The Shaoyin kidney channel should be warm and not cold; if wind and cold enter, the fire of the life gate is diminished, and the kidney palace becomes entirely cold, which inevitably causes the uterus to be cold as well. Cold hands and feet indicate extreme cold in the spleen and stomach. When the spleen and stomach are extremely cold, how can one survive? Yet, I believe life is still possible as the fetus has not yet descended. One should urgently use warming herbs to rescue it. The prescription is named &quot;Wind Dispelling and Fetus Rescuing Decoction,&quot; consisting of one tael of ginseng, two taels of atractylodes, and one qian each of cinnamon, dried ginger, and licorice, boiled with water for consumption.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a></p></div>

<p>Pregnant women experiencing symptoms of the Shao Yin channel such as nausea, abdominal pain, and cold extremities should not be treated.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; states: In the third month of pregnancy, if the fetus is at risk of miscarriage, moxibustion should be applied one inch below the knee at seven spots. In the first month of pregnancy, nourish the foot jueyin pulse; in the second month, nourish the foot shaoyang pulse; in the third month, nourish the hand xin main pulse; in the fourth month, nourish the hand shaoyang pulse; in the fifth month, nourish the foot taiyin pulse; in the sixth month, nourish the foot yangming pulse; in the seventh month, nourish the hand taiyin pulse; in the eighth month, nourish the hand yangming pulse; in the ninth month, nourish the foot shaoyin pulse. Each month, when nourishing the fetus with these pulses, acupuncture or moxibustion should not be performed.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Introduction&quot; states: Pregnant women should not undergo acupuncture at Hegu (LI4) or Sanyinjiao (SP6).</p>
<p>When a woman is about to give birth, if the fetus has already ruptured, and foul water flows continuously, and there is early cessation of blood to nourish, leading to exhaustion, puncture the point at Duyin (the fifth point of the Yinqiao) between the third joint of the little toe, five-tenths of an inch into Chengyin.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: If there are alternating chills and fever, coughing with blood and phlegm, or vomiting with loss of appetite and weakness, or chest fullness with pain along the spine, or a mouth that produces saliva like frost and snow, without speech, or tinnitus, or excessive phlegm and saliva day and night, it is due to the misuse of hot medicines. Puncture Fengmen (BL12) and Po Hu (BL42) each by five-tenths of an inch, and through the point at Zhigou (TE5). If chills and fever persist, puncture the absolute bones (Yao) at five-tenths of an inch, and Taixi (KD3) at three-tenths of an inch. If the pulse and qi are still unbalanced, then drain Taiyuan (LU9) and Taibai (SP3) each by two-tenths of an inch. Heat accumulation at unspecified points can be treated by draining for immediate effect or nourishing for deficient conditions to resolve pre-labor issues. After the condition stabilizes, there will surely be a change within half a year; if limbs become emaciated and the abdomen swells, then puncture Yinjiao (SP6) to remove the harmful substances.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a></p></div>

<p>The text from &quot;The Filial Conduct of the Confucian School&quot; states: A person from Dai went to Dong Qi, where a woman was suffering from severe constipation and difficult urination, having been unable to conceive for half her life. When she took a laxative, her bowels moved freely, but when she stopped the medicine, her condition would worsen. Suddenly, she became pregnant, and during the fourth or fifth month, the physician prohibited laxatives, leading to her usual difficulty with bowel movements. When she tried to defecate, she exerted herself greatly, resulting in a miscarriage. This happened three times. By the time she became pregnant for the third or fourth month, both her urine and bowel movements were still difficult, and she felt a sweet separation from her pregnancy, prompting her to consult the person from Dai. Upon examining her pulse, the physician found it slippery and strong, but because she was pregnant, he didn’t dare to apply strong treatments and opted for dietary therapy instead. He prepared dishes using flower alkali to cook water chestnuts and sunflower greens, made porridge with plantago seeds mixed with pig and sheep blood for her to eat. After half a year, she miraculously gave birth, and her constipation was finally cured.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mr. Liu&#39;s wife was six months pregnant but experienced bleeding due to an injury, so she sought medicine from Mr. Dai. Mr. Dai diagnosed her and prescribed a combination of Sanhe Decoction, Yuzhu Powder, Chengqi Decoction, and Siwu Decoction, adding a decoction of (Shibu) Nitrate. After several doses, the pain, which felt as if pinched by hand, ceased and the bleeding also stopped.</p>
<p>A woman over forty became pregnant, believing that due to her age and many ailments, her sickness had returned and reported this to the physician. The physician, failing to investigate properly, applied moxibustion around her navel and used toxic medicine to attack her condition, resulting in increased abdominal pain, reduced appetite, and she grew gaunt, eventually lying in bed. She sought Mr. Dai&#39;s help. Mr. Dai checked her pulse and said: &quot;All six pulses are even, but the pulse at the right wrist is strong and large; this indicates pregnancy.&quot; Everyone laughed at him. A few months later, she gave birth to a girl, whose lower eyelids bore marks from moxibustion, nearly losing her sight. It is crucial to inquire about pregnancy first when treating women; one must not act hastily.</p>
<p>The wife of King Hu was afflicted with a mass below her navel, along with vomiting and loss of appetite; she appeared pale and emaciated with no menstrual flow. Some suggested it was due to a lack of blood and qi, but treatment was ineffective. Mr. Dai observed her and declared she was pregnant, though the person did not believe it. After repeated requests for treatment from Mr. Dai, he gave her a mild remedy to satisfy her desire but refused to prescribe toxic medicine. Eventually, after a month, she indeed gave birth. When asked how he recognized it, Mr. Dai replied: &quot;The pulse at the wrist is strong and large; as mentioned in the &#39;Suwen,&#39; it refers to the distinction between yin and yang as indicated by the pulse.&quot;<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhu Zhenheng&#39;s &quot;Mind Method&quot; states: A woman, three months pregnant, experiences phlegm and water along with food every day, feeling a rushing sensation in the lower abdomen during the early morning. At these times, she feels fullness in the diaphragm, followed by vomiting, a flushed face with slight agitation, dizziness, inability to rise from bed, and aching limbs with mild thirst. This indicates liver fire along with the Qi of the Chong vessel rushing upwards. Some days are worse, some are better. The pulse is harmonious, yet the right inch pulse is strong and large. If a hundred medications are ineffective, one should wait two months. Occasionally, using sandalwood to grind in water to dissolve the Bao Long Wan, one dose can relieve the fullness in the diaphragm and prevent the Qi from rushing upwards; after two or three doses, vomiting stops, dizziness reduces, and eating becomes stable.</p>
<p>A woman from the Ying family, seven months pregnant, sometimes vomits food, with the fetus causing fullness and obstruction beneath the heart, Qi attacking the back, and both elbows pained, needing someone to constantly rub and press. By applying heat and massaging, she manages to vomit a little, with a strong pulse. The remedy consisted of two and a half qian of huang qin, one qian of stir-fried huang lian, two qian each of stir-fried bai zhu and ban xia, five fen each of roasted gan cao and sha ren, one qian each of chen pi, dang gui, shan zhi, stir-fried zhi ke, xiang fu, ren shen, and cang zhu, and one and a half qian of fu ling, along with seven slices of fresh ginger. After taking two doses, the chaotic vomiting ceased and the fullness diminished. However, during the night, she experienced back and elbow pain, so she applied heat again, and subsequently took the Bao Long Wan, which relieved the ailment as if it were gone.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman nearing thirty years of age, two months pregnant, suffered from vomiting and dizziness, feeling that she could not withstand it. She took ginseng, astragalus, chuanxiong, dried tangerine peel, and poria, but after five or seven days, felt increasingly heavy. I was called to pulse diagnose her; both hands showed a string-like pulse, particularly weak on the left side. I said: &quot;This is a case of adverse pregnancy conditions, certainly agitated by anger.&quot; Upon inquiry, this proved true. With the liver&#39;s qi counterflowing and intertwined with the fetal qi, tonics like ginseng and astragalus were highly inappropriate. I advised her to take a decoction of poria and to use 24 pills of Yiqing Wan, after which she felt somewhat better. Upon examining her pulse, there were slight irregularities; she reported dry mouth and bitterness, and that eating congee made her mouth sour. I suspected this was due to stagnant qi in the diaphragm. I instructed her to take a herbal formulation of chuanxiong, dried tangerine peel, gardenia fruit, poria, and ginger, plus 15 pills of Yiqing Wan. After ten days, her remaining symptoms were resolved, but she noticed a sour taste after meals and felt easily hungry when not eating. I said the liver heat had not yet subsided. I instructed her to take a light broth with 20 pills of Yiqing Wan, and after twenty days, she was stable. Upon checking her pulse again, although both hands showed peace, the pulse on the right was still weak; thus, I warned that a miscarriage was imminent. Now that the liver&#39;s qi was balanced, ginseng and astragalus could be used. I began using these tonics to prevent miscarriage, addressing her future deficiency. After one month of this treatment, she miscarried but remained calm and without issues afterward. Yiqing Wan consists solely of a single ingredient, huanglian (coptis).<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman in her thirties, pregnant for four months, was suffering from constipation and had difficulty urinating. After taking some medicines including winter melon seeds, she was able to relieve herself, but her energy remained unbalanced. This was caused by her impatience, which had depleted her blood and disrupted her energy. Therefore, I prescribed soothing medications to nourish her energy and blood, bringing her comfort.</p>
<p>Another woman, aged forty-one, was nine months pregnant and had not urinated for three days. She was in severe pain, with swollen legs and felt she could not survive. When I examined her, I found her condition weakened, with a rapid pulse on the right and a slightly more stable pulse on the left. This condition arose from food stagnation harming her energy, making her fetus unable to lift itself and pressing against the bladder, causing her inability to urinate. This is generally how the condition of troubled pregnancy manifests. </p>
<p>I then prepared a prescription to nourish her blood and energy. Once her blood and energy were rectified, the fetus would lift itself, preventing further descent, which would bring her peace of mind. Therefore, I used ginseng, angelica root, white peony, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, roasted licorice, pinellia, and ginger, decocting them into a strong soup. I gave her four doses, allowing her to drink frequently. By the next morning, I also prepared the residue from the four doses into one more decoction, instructing her to drink it quickly and to induce vomiting to release the medicinal soup. This led to immediate urination, which was dark. </p>
<p>Subsequently, I augmented this prescription with large belly peel, bitter orange, green scallion leaves, and twenty doses of cardamom, to prevent weakness before and after delivery.

Her condition worsened with increasing urgency and swelling, and upon examining her pulse, it was weak and thin. I suspected that her blood and energy were insufficient to support the fetus, causing it to descend and press against the bladder opening, making it impossible for her to urinate. I recommended that she take tonifying medicine to uplift and support the fetus, which would then relieve the obstruction. Before the medicine could take effect, the urgency increased further. Thus, I instructed an elderly woman to use fragrant oil on her hands, enter through the delivery door, and support the fetus. As a result, she was able to urinate profusely, and the swelling and urgency immediately alleviated. At the same time, I prescribed a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, and licorice to be decocted and taken. If there was still some urgency, she would continue to support the fetus to aid urination.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman became pregnant but was likely to miscarry by the third month. I instructed her to prepare a strong decoction of white atractylodes and, mixed with two qian of huangqin powder, to take it for three to four weeks, which allowed her to carry the pregnancy to term. This is because pregnancy, reaching the third month, is associated with yang fire, making miscarriage more likely. Otherwise, how could huangqin and white atractylodes be known as wonderful medicines to secure a pregnancy? </p>
<p>A woman over thirty, who had either experienced missed periods or an incomplete physical form in her pregnancy, faced inevitable miscarriage. Observing her temperament—impatient, easily angered, with a dark complexion and strong energy—showed that her yang fire was too excessive; thus, she could not sustain the vital energy to nourish the fetus, and instead, her appetite harmed her vital essence. Therefore, I instructed her to stop menstruation in the second month and used huangqin, white atractylodes, angelica, and licorice, advising her to continue until the end of the third month, which led to the birth of a son.</p>
<p>The &quot;Miscellaneous Writings of Ming Medicine&quot; states: My wife once had a miscarriage, and one day experienced heavy bleeding, which resulted in contractions. I gave her a remedy using the urine of a child to awaken her and soon returned the contractions. I urgently prepared a decoction of schizonepeta, administering it as her contractions recurred. However, the medicines to stop the bleeding were ineffective, and suddenly she vomited. I provided her with the child’s urine and found it filled her chest. I used my hand to induce vomiting, and after a short while, she expelled a bowl of rice and pickled vegetables. When inquiring about this incident, she had become angry just after lunch, which caused the bleeding to continue. I concluded that due to her recent fullness of food, her stomach energy was stagnant, leading to severe bleeding. Since the bleeding was substantial, her stomach energy was further depleted, resulting in the ineffectiveness of the medicine. Therefore, I urgently needed to regulate her spleen and stomach, and thus I used five qian of white atractylodes, along with two qian each of dried tangerine peel and barley sprouts, which she took as a decoction. Before long, her contractions stopped, and after an additional dose, the bleeding ceased.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thus, one must focus on treating the spleen and stomach, taking several doses, allowing the stomach energy to gradually return, and then adding blood tonics to ensure recovery. If one does not carefully evaluate the presence of food stagnation and then administers blood-stopping or blood-moving medicines, would that not be a mistake? Generally, physicians treating various diseases must constantly observe if there is injury from food accumulation. If the patient experiences fullness and discomfort in the chest, vomiting, belching, sour throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or aversion to food, one should ask about their recent diet. Upon confirming injury from food stagnation, adjustments to the spleen and stomach should be made first to digest and regulate the food, and then the primary disease can be treated, or digestive aids can be added to the main medicinal formula. Failing to recognize this may result in using appropriate medicines without effect. The spleen and stomach are fundamentally important; if the stomach energy is damaged, it cannot process the medicinal flavors to achieve results. Additionally, there are cases where one takes medicine right after eating, or sleeps immediately after taking medicine, or takes excessive amounts of medicine, which is termed harming the medicine. It is essential to be aware of these situations.<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: </p>
<p>A pregnant woman experience vomiting and aversion to food, feeling fatigued and wanting to sleep; this is due to a deficiency of stomach qi and obstruction. Two doses of ginseng and tangerine peel decoction gradually improved her condition, followed by one dose of Six Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction with perilla leaf for stabilization.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman feels sourness and nausea, sometimes wanting to vomit; this is because of a deficiency in spleen and stomach, leading to food stagnation. She was treated with Six Gentlemen&#39;s Decoction combined with bitter orange and nutmeg, resulting in recovery. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A pregnant woman experiences internal heat and fever in the afternoon, possibly accompanied by chills and fever, with diminished appetite and thoughts. The fetus may feel like it is dropping or pushing upwards; this indicates a deficiency of blood in the liver channel leading to an active fire. First, administer several doses of a modified Xiaoyao Decoction, then use six gentlemen decoction with Chaihu and Zhike for recovery.</p>
<p>A woman in her sixth month of pregnancy feels weak and fatigued, with a diminished appetite. Labor results in blood flow, and the fetus is unsettled. Treatment involves six gentlemen decoction, Shudihu, Shengma, and Chaihu, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman has a blood discharge; when she takes cooling blood herbs, the bleeding worsens, and she feels fatigued with diminished appetite. This indicates a deficiency of spleen qi that cannot hold blood. Then use the Bei Zhong Yi Qi Decoction for recovery. However, due to anger leading to cold and heat, the bleeding continues; this reflects an excess of liver fire causing blood to boil. Administer a modified Xiaoyao Decoction to stop the bleeding and then stabilize with the Bei Zhong Yi Qi Decoction.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman has blood discharge, experiences fever and thirst, and feels fatigued with reduced appetite. This is due to a deficiency of spleen qi being insulted by liver fire. Use Four Gentlemen Decoction with Chaihu and Shan Zhi Zhi for blood cessation. If anger arises again and the bleeding restarts, switch to Six Gentlemen Decoction with Chaihu, Shan Zhi Zhi, and Shengma for stability.</p>
<p>In the third month of pregnancy, her menstrual period may come three to five times, though not heavily. She maintains her appetite and spirits; this indicates excess blood. When the child grows large enough to drink, it will no longer come. Indeed, this is correct.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>During a six-month pregnancy, a woman experienced frequent anger and bleeding, along with chills, fever, headaches, distension in the sides, abdominal pain, nausea, and reduced appetite. I concluded that the chills and headaches were due to liver fire rising, the distension and pain were caused by obstructed liver qi, the nausea and reduced appetite were due to the liver insulting the spleen and stomach, and the blood in the urine indicated heat in the liver and blood. I treated her with Xiao Chai Hu Tang, adding Shao Yao, roasted black 山栀, and Fu Ling, and she recovered.</p>
<p>In another case, a pregnant woman was fatigued and had a poor appetite; she experienced bleeding after exertion. I administered Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Dang Gui, Shu Di, Sheng Ma, and Chai Hu, and she recovered.</p>
<p>Another pregnant woman, after being angered, felt pressure in her abdomen, with a left pulse that was wiry and rapid, indicating internal liver fire. I used Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Fu Ling, Zhi Ke, and Shan Zhi, and she recovered. However, since her fatigue was linked to a poor appetite, I used Liu Jun Zi to nourish the spleen, adding Chai Hu and Zhi Ke to regulate the liver qi, resulting in her recovery.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman felt pressure in her abdomen, had fullness in her chest, burped frequently, and ate little. This indicated stagnation of spleen qi. I administered Zi Su drink for immediate relief, and later combined Si Jun Zi Tang with Zhi Ke, Chai Hu, and Shan Zhi, and she recovered.</p>
<p>One more pregnant woman, after becoming angry, experienced ineffective digestion and a reduced appetite. This led to weakness in her spleen and stomach, decreasing appetite further, with irregular and loose stools. Over time, her stools became yellow water or showed white. Observing her complexion, I noted yellow indicated a spleen deficiency, while white indicated lung deficiency. In the morning, I gave her Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to support her stomach qi, and in the evening, I provided Liu Jun Zi Tang to nourish her spleen qi, resulting in her recovery.<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A pregnant woman, due to anger, experienced alternating chills and fever, internal heat and afternoon heat, pain in the flanks and vomiting. When the fetus reached eight months, it did not grow. This was caused by liver and spleen stagnation due to anger. A prescription of Six Gentlemen Decoction, combined with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, Gen Ke, Zi Su, and Jie Geng was used, and the condition improved while the fetus also grew.</p>
<p>A lady of the Honglu family, after suffering from dysentery, found her spirit and mind troubled, and her limbs unusually fatigued. After taking over twenty doses of Ba Zhen San, she gradually improved. However, due to labor and added heat, she developed a headache. A large dose of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Man Jing Zi treated it, and the heat and pain ceased immediately. The previous decoction was continued, and after more than fifty additional doses, she was stable. Later, her delivery was very easy.</p>
<p>A woman experienced pain wanting to miscarry every three to four months. It was deemed to be a painful fetus, and she was treated with two qian of Dong Gui and three qian of cooked Di Huang, which led to recovery.</p>
<p>In the eighth month of her pregnancy, a woman felt the fetus about to fall out as if in labor. Lying down for a long time, she found little comfort, and the condition worsened by afternoon. It was observed that this was due to qi and blood deficiency. In the morning, she took Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Fu Ling and Ban Xia, leading to improvement. She further took Ba Zhen Decoction for adjustment, which assured her stability.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman had severe shortness of breath and phlegm; various medicines were ineffective. She had a history of leucorrhea, which began with swelling below the eyes for over two months, with her face being similarly affected. This indicated qi deficiency with phlegm fluid. After taking several doses of Liu Wei Wan, she recovered.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a></p></div>

<p>A pregnant woman experiences lower abdominal pain, the fetus is unstable, qi attacks to the sides, and occasionally reverses upward, with difficulty in urination. Use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Qing Pi and Shan Zhi to clear liver fire and recover. Later, due to anger, the lower abdomen becomes distended, urination is hindered, and there is a heavy sensation in the waterway, while the fetus remains unstable. This is also caused by excessive liver wood; use Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction for immediate relief. Then, reinforce the spleen soil with the Four Gentlemen’s Decoction plus Chai Hu and Sheng Ma to stabilize.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman has stagnation in digestion, leading to fullness in the chest and abdomen. Sometimes use Ren Shen Yang Wei Decoction with Qing Pi, Shan Zha, and Zhi Ke; if fullness worsens, the fetus pushes upward, causing nausea and loss of appetite, with a strong, wiry pulse on the right guan. This indicates insufficient spleen soil, bullied by liver wood. Continue with Liu Jun Zi Tang plus Chai Hu and Sheng Ma for recovery. Later, if the lower abdomen feels distended, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to elevate spleen qi, resulting in cure.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman, due to anger, vomits blood clots and does not stop for four days. There is bloating and pain in the sides, with difficult urination. This results from anger, with blood accumulating above, pushing out with the fire. The bloating and abdominal pain, along with difficult urination, signifies liver channel illness. Use Xiao Chai Hu combined with Si Wu for four doses to stop the bleeding; follow with Liu Jun Zi and An Tai Decoction for adjustment and peace.<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another pregnant woman was unable to extend her limbs; after taking a remedy to expel wind and dry dampness, she had severe stool and phlegm retention. Her limbs would convulse, and I believed it was due to liver fire and blood dryness. I treated her with Ba Zhen Tang and added stir-fried black huang qin as the main ingredient, supplemented with Gou Teng Tang, and she stabilized. However, after becoming angry, her previous symptoms reoccurred with blood in the urine, alternating chills and fever, and difficulty sleeping, along with a reduced appetite. I used Diao Teng San with added shan zhi and chai hu to stop the bleeding; then I applied the modified Xiao Yao San, which alleviated her chills and fever, allowing her to sleep.

<p>A woman who had toiled hard had irregular menstruation with alternating chills and fever.

<p>A woman, three months pregnant, after eating, fell ill due to anger and suffered from malaria, vomiting three times in a row. I prescribed Huo Xiang Zheng Qi San for two doses, followed by An Tai Yin for one dose, and she recovered. Later, due to anger, she experienced excessive phlegm, delirious speech, fever, chest distension, and pressure relief was poor; this indicated stagnation of liver and spleen energy.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A pregnant woman had a sudden onset of diarrhea, which had since stopped, but she did not want to eat or drink. She experienced a sour taste in her mouth and frequent urges to relieve herself. I said: This is due to the harm and deficiency of the stomach’s qi, and we should use the Four Gentlemen Decoction. She did not believe this and instead took the Ginseng and Stomach Nourishing Decoction. She vomited sour water and felt the fetus was not stable; these medicines worsened her condition. I then administered the Four Gentlemen Decoction, instructing her to first inhale the medicinal scent, and if she did not feel nauseous, to take a small sip. If she were to feel nauseous again, it could disturb the fetus. After about ten days, she recovered.</p>
<p>Minister Bian&#39;s concubine experienced diarrhea during her pregnancy. She used herbs like bitter orange, atractylodes, and coptis, which resulted in abdominal distension, phlegm production, fever, and chills. Whenever food entered her mouth, she felt an urge to vomit; even forcing a spoonful led to sour and uncomfortable sensations. She wanted to use remedies to expel phlegm and regulate q. I said: This is due to the damage to the spleen and stomach, causing phlegm stagnation. If we treat phlegm and qi, we would only harm the spleen and stomach further. Therefore, I crushed ginseng, atractylodes, and roasted ginger into a powder, making pills the size of millet. She was instructed to dissolve three to five pills gradually over time. After three days, she was able to take the Six Gentlemen Decoction daily and soon recovered.</p>
<p>In the case of the scholar Wang, he experienced diarrhea and a dislike of food during his pregnancy, accompanied by nausea. I said: This is due to damage to the spleen&#39;s qi. His family was concerned and insisted he consume rice soup. I advised that even drinking could harm the stomach, and it was unnecessary to force it; he should wait for the spleen and stomach to regain their strength as the stagnation would resolve itself, allowing for natural eating and drinking. He did not believe me and instead took the Ginseng and Stomach Nourishing Decoction, which caused him to vomit sour and bitter water and stimulated the desire for cold and fire-expelling medicines. I cautioned that this would only further harm the stomach’s qi. The classic says that to harm the spleen and stomach is to focus on dietary considerations that suit one’s condition. Eventually, without medication, he indeed recovered.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a></p></div>

<p>There was a woman who would experience anger leading to heat, side swelling, and dribbling urination, resembling her menstrual period; this lasted for over ten days.

In treating pregnancy, do not get bogged down by the number of months; simply observe the symptoms of a specific channel and use appropriate remedies.</p>
<p>Another pregnant woman stopped eating and took Zhi Zhu Wan, but continued to experience discomfort in her chest and abdomen, with increasing loss of appetite. I prescribed digestive and relaxing medications, but her fetus was lower than normal. I assessed this as spleen qi deficiency that could not support the pregnancy. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Liu Jun Zi Tang, gradually strengthening the central qi, which helped stabilize her fetus. I also used Ba Zhen Tang with Chai Hu and Sheng Ma for regulation, leading to her full recovery.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A pregnant woman, feeling sorrow without reason, recovered after taking two doses of jujube soup. Later, she experienced the same issue again and took the previous soup supplemented with four gentlemen&#39;s decoction and added gardenia, which brought her peace.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman was distressed and restless. When her husband asked her, she said she felt sad for no reason. She was given a gentle bamboo shoot soup as the main remedy, supplemented with an eight treasures soup, which helped her feel calm.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman had a fever and thirst, and her body ached all over. She took two doses of the Immortal Vitality Decoction, which slightly alleviated her symptoms. On the 11th day, over a hundred pox appeared on her body, and she felt extremely fatigued. A remedy of lithospermum and aromatic wood was used, and some relief was obtained. However, she still felt dry and thirsty, so she was given ginseng and white atractylodes powder to quench her thirst, followed by an eight treasures soup with added bupleurum and moutan, which helped expel pus. Later, they removed moutan and bupleurum and increased the ginseng and astragalus, administering several doses until the pox marks improved.</p>
<p>A woman at eight months of pregnancy felt her fetus descending or moving, her face was pale, and she felt fatigued with little appetite; she was diagnosed with weak spleen energy. She took a tonifying central qi decoction with increased white atractylodes and added siler; after over thirty doses, she felt better. After childbirth, she had dizziness, fullness in her chest, and a cough. She was treated with a four substances decoction supplemented with poria, pinellia, and balloon flower until she recovered.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Principles and Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment,&quot; it is noted that the wife of a general during her pregnancy suffered from persistent dysentery. When the immortal physician examined her pulse, it was found to be weak and slippery, and her two pulses were very thin. This was due to disharmony in the fetal qi, with excess fire causing heat, resembling dysentery but not being it. Therefore, yellow qin and white atractylodes were used to stabilize the fetus, along with four substances and raw rehmannia to regulate the blood, and after several doses, she was stabilized.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a></p></div>

Hao said: &quot;Quickly stop the medicine; this is a symptom of pregnancy, and congratulations to you on expecting a son.&quot; Eventually, this was indeed the case.</p>
<p>Another two women were pregnant: one was mute and could not speak. Hao indicated: &quot;The fetus is obstructing the channels; once the child is born, she will speak again. Do not poison her with medicine.&quot; The other woman was robust and strong; Hao diagnosed her pulse and said: &quot;The mother’s energy has already diminished, hence the child survives by relying on the child’s energy.&quot; As expected, the child was born, but the mother died.</p>
<p>A woman was violently thirsty, drinking only a five-flavor juice. The renowned physician Geng Yu diagnosed her pulse and said: &quot;This is blood wanting to coagulate, not an illness.&quot; Eventually, she became pregnant. There is an ancient formula that recognizes the symptom of thirst and coagulation of blood, which should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Doctor Pan Jing diagnosed that the wife of Yu&#39;s Assistant Officer Zhang Xian had been pregnant for five years, the wife of Nanling&#39;s Wei Fu Changling for two years, and the concubine of the envoy Liu Yi Sun for fourteen months, none of whom had given birth. Old man Pan looked at them and declared: &quot;This is a sickness; all doctors mistakenly consider this pregnancy.&quot; Consequently, he administered potent medicines to break the blood and expel toxins. The wife of the Assistant Officer expelled over a hundred flesh-like clots; Wei Changling&#39;s wife dreamed of two dark-skinned boys who abruptly fled in fear; Yi Sun&#39;s concubine gave birth to a large snake, which was still squirming and not yet dead. All three women were unscathed.</p>
<p>Ye Nanzhou&#39;s wife had not menstruated for five months and had discharges of white or red, along with afternoon fevers, coughing, and vomiting. Doctors diagnosed her with consumption from overexertion. Chen Douyan examined her and said: &quot;Both pulses are firm; she must be pregnant, affected by external wind evils.&quot; He prescribed a gentle harmonizing remedy and she gave birth to two sons six months later.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a></p></div>

Neither physicians nor shamans were of any help. Then, with the remedy from Mr. Guan and the jujube soup from Zhongjing, she recovered immediately. </p>
<p>A pregnant woman was ill, and the doctor said she might miscarriage. Qian Zhongyang remarked: &quot;In pregnancy, the five organs provide nourishment; it generally changes every sixty days. If one adjusts appropriately during her months, why should she have a miscarriage?&quot; In the end, both mother and child were fine.</p>
<p>A woman suffered from a blockage, and the more she treated it, the worse it became. Reflecting on the comment from the &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; about stopping treatments for cases of vomiting and purging, she halted her medications, and after a month, found peace.</p>
<p>A pregnant woman seven months along, felt pressure and shortness of breath in her chest, suddenly vomited something about the size of a small intestine. Her family was alarmed, thinking her fetus was rotting. When Cheng Wenbin arrived and diagnosed her pulse as strong and smooth, he realized her Qi was abundant but her blood was insufficient. The fetal Qi accumulated in the middle jiao, leading to damp heat and phlegm production. He identified the vomited substance as consolidated phlegm. The illness was named &quot;fetal hanging,&quot; and with a formula of perilla drink augmented with Scutellaria, Coptis, and Fritillaria for ten doses, she was cured.</p>
<p>Madam Wang, the wife of an official, three months pregnant, experienced recurring pain in her waist and abdomen, with constant leakage and feelings of bloating and discomfort. Yan Jiang was called for a consultation. His diagnosis found her six pulses taut and numerous, in contrast to her usual deep and thin pulse, indicating anger had provoked liver fire, leading to internal heat. Despite a non-slippery pulse, she was not far from treatment failure and could still be preserved. He prescribed a decoction of Scutellaria, Atractylodes, Bitter Orange, Cyperus, Poria, donkey-hide gelatin, White Peony, Angelica, and dried tangerine peel, simmered with fine powdered calcined deer antler wine. Adding Yiping pills, she experienced relief from the pain after just one dose, and several doses later her condition stabilized.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a></p></div>

He prescribed a formula of Six Gentlemen with cardamom, taken several times, which brought her comfort.</p>
<p>Another woman, eight months into her pregnancy, suddenly suffered from lower back pain and was unable to turn, with constipation as well. The physician prescribed ginseng and other tonics, but the pain worsened. Using laxatives did not relieve the pain despite the constipation easing. Wang Shishan examined her pulse, finding it somewhat rapid, and concluded it was caused by heat and stagnation of blood. He recommended a formula of Four Substances with added herbs including incense, myrrh, yellow herbal, and hemp seeds. After taking four to five doses, her pain reduced, and the constipation improved, but she developed a fever and redness on her face, along with occasional chills. He adjusted the formula, removing the incense and myrrh, and adding Chai Hu and Huang Qin. After two doses, her chills and fever abated.

Some argued that excess qi and blood were needed for pregnancy, and with both qi and blood depleted, how could she conceive? Observing her long form and fine, weak pulse indicated a deficiency in both qi and blood; a blue complexion with a stringy pulse pointed to fiery liver heat; while the two pulse positions felt floating and slippery suggested a lighter blood deficiency with heavier qi deficiency. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, long and thin with a yellow-white complexion, was quick-tempered, over thirty years old, and often suffered from miscarriage, having experienced seven or eight. Wang Shishan examined her pulse, which was soft and weak; both pulses were floating yet feeble and could not endure pressure. He said: This is due to having had too many miscarriages, leading to severe depletion of qi and blood, leaving no nourishment for the fetus, hence the frequent losses. It is like water running dry causing the grain to wither, and soil being eroded causing the trees to fall. Furthermore, during the third and fifth months, it is precisely when the lesser yang fire is active, and coupled with her temperament being quick and urgent, this is why she often miscarried in the third, fifth, and seventh months. It is advisable to take a restorative decoction without cinnamon, adding huangbo and huangqin to be decocted and taken. Additionally, grinding into powder and making honey pills to take, may help preserve the pregnancy. After taking it for six months, the fetus stabilized and she gave birth to two sons.</p>
<p>Another woman had a fragile and small physique, her complexion nearly purple. Over a year after giving birth, her menstrual flow had stopped, and suddenly in early summer, she fell ill with vomiting, numbness in her fingers, and her fists could not open. Her voice was hoarse and soft, and she could not produce sounds. Physicians viewed her symptoms as a serious wind disease. Wang Shishan examined her and found her pulse to be fine and slippery, stating: This is due to pregancy complication. Many argued about her menstrual flow being obstructed, questioning how there could be pregnancy. Wang remarked: In this world, some matters are constant while others change; this is a case of change. Though the pulse was fine and slippery, the pulses at the wrist were not interrupted, indicating pregnancy. Thus, he treated her with Four Gentlemen Decoction plus two Chen herbs, and all her symptoms diminished. She remained wary of porridge and soup, only able to eat dry cakes and aromatic, roasted foods with some vitality.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, nearing thirty years of age, was thin and pale. Occasionally, she would cough once or twice, with her menstrual cycle either early or delayed. In the summer, she sought relief from the heat and ended up coughing severely, unable to lie down for over a month. The phlegm she coughed up sometimes had blood or pus in it; when the coughing intensified, she would vomit food. Doctors prescribed herbs like Qín and Lián, as well as Er Chén, but there was no effect. They then used tonics like Ginseng and Astragalus, yet her condition worsened. </p>
<p>Doctor Wang Shishan examined her and found her left pulse to be floating and slippery, while her right pulse was somewhat weak and also slippery. Her wrist had been injured and could not extend, and the right pulse seemed difficult to assess. He decided to examine the left pulse again, fearing she might be pregnant with lung abscess. He then prescribed a formula to clear and drain the lungs. After three doses, she was able to lie down, did not vomit phlegm, and did not cough up pus. However, she occasionally experienced difficulty. Doctor Wang stated that this was a common ailment during pregnancy. </p>
<p>He recommended taking a decoction of Coix seed, Atractylodes, Poria, Ophiopogon, Huang Qin, and Ejiao, which led to an improvement. Over a month later, upon re-examination, the pulses were slightly slower and floating, and he remarked that the heat had diminished. However, she was still vomiting too much blood, which could harm her stomach. He advised a decoction of Four Gentlemen&#39;s formula with addition of Chen Pi, Huang Qin, and Zhi Ke to regulate her condition. </p>
<p>As her pregnancy reached six months, she had an adverse reaction after eating chicken. She stopped eating chicken and recovered. By September, her illness recurred, leading to a hoarse voice, and she was advised to take children&#39;s urine for comfort. Doctor Wang said that after childbirth, her illness would resolve, which was a good sign. He warned that if the illness recurred, it was beyond his knowledge. When the pregnancy was full term, her stomach and spleen ailments flared up, leading to excessive discharge, and ultimately, she could not be saved.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhong Cang Xu Shaowei sent a command to Jintan at that time, as the lady was experiencing a miscarriage, and treatment was ongoing without success. Under pressure from the upper authorities, he wished to follow the prevailing momentum and take action, consulting me. I simply instructed that she take Foshou San, believing that if it could stabilize the situation, it would; if not, it would lead to a miscarriage, allowing things to proceed naturally. After taking it several times, he remained anxious and indecisive. A female specialist in gynecology presented a prescription, which included two taels of niuxi (achyranthes) boiled in wine for consumption. She asserted that niuxi is a tonic for the lower body, so what harm could it do? He believed her and consumed it, and indeed, the fetus was expelled. At that time, there was a relative of mine from my mother’s side who was unaware, but when they rushed to inform me, I heard that the entire courtyard was filled with the fragrance of osmanthus and musk, probably because after niuxi was expelled, Xu had introduced fragrant osmanthus powder. Blood then gushed forth uncontrollably, like a river breaking its banks, and I urgently prepared a decoction of dangshen (codonopsis), but before it was ready, she passed away. The gentleman was initially filled with sorrow; as he passed by my place, he pondered aloud to me: &quot;How could niuxi, a supplement, cause a miscarriage?&quot; I replied: &quot;When something is alive, it descends; when it is cooked, it supplements. Therefore, the effects of breaking blood and filling essence are like the tips of arrows supporting each other; isn’t it just niuxi? Lu jiao (deer antler) can also cause miscarriages and break blood, yet when boiled into bai jiao (white glue), it can stabilize pregnancy and stop bleeding. The ignorance of its raw nature leads to such crude practices.&quot; He lamented endlessly. I thus specially wrote this down as a warning for the world.<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Transmission&quot; states: A pregnant woman had both malaria and dysentery at the same time. After over two months of treatment, the malaria stopped but the dysentery worsened, with added abdominal pain and a reduced appetite. I was called to examine her. I said: It is a deficiency of cold. I prescribed a restorative formula with ginger and cassia, and after one dose, the dysentery had significantly improved. However, after another dose, the malaria worsened again. The family was alarmed, and I said: This is a good sign. The previous cessation of malaria signified an extreme dominance of yin, causing yang to hesitate in contention. Now, with the administration of the restorative yang medicine, the yang energy is empowered to contend with the yin. If we can further support the strength of yang, the yin will retreat of its own accord. I added five fen of fuzi to the formula, and both the malaria and dysentery were cured. After taking the restorative medicine thoroughly for three months, she gave birth to a son, who was very healthy after delivery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Comprehensive Records of Offspring&quot; mentions: The wife of Xiong Jing, the county magistrate of Luotian, was pregnant and suffered from pain and heat in her fifth month. She consulted a female doctor, Zhu Tinghe, who treated her for malaria. Later, she sought the help of a scholar, Wan Yuan, whose treatment added dysentery. By the eighth month, both malaria and dysentery occurred together, prompting her to ask a master for combined treatment. Upon diagnosing her pulse, I found the left hand to be deep and strong, while the right pulse was floating, large, and weak. This indicated an internal injury from male pregnancy. I used a restorative formula combined with qinghao and baizhu, and after over ten doses, both malaria and dysentery ceased. Later, she was stabilized with Hu Lian pills. In the following spring, she indeed gave birth to a boy.<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a></p></div>
