<p><strong>External Medicine: The Reflected Flower, Heavenly Bubble, Yangmei Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers [Song Dynasty, Dou Hanqing]</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Heavenly Bubble</strong></p>
<p>This sore can affect people of all ages and is caused by the noxious heat of hot summer, which penetrates the muscles. It begins as a single blister and gradually spreads, leading to the body rotting without respite, and can infect an entire family. This condition requires cleansing with water and must not be touched by foul air. Internally, take a clearing decoction to dispel dampness; externally, use a poison-scraping ointment mixed with clay.</p>
<p><strong>Yangmei</strong></p>
<p>Also known as Guangdong sore or mold sore, this is a buildup of toxins in the internal organs, particularly damp heat in the spleen. There are three causes for its occurrence: a man engaging with a woman who suffers from sores, thereby being exposed to her toxic vapors; or a person with weak constitution encountering someone with sores, allowing foul air to enter the intestines and stomach; or a person already afflicted with sores, using a public restroom, where the toxic air remains and unknowingly enters through the orifices, gradually penetrating the internal organs. It may start on the head, under the ribs, or near the anus, with variations seen in male and female manifestations: the male type is as large as a ginkgo nut, covered with fifty to a hundred scattered spots; the female type is as small as a bean, with connected patches, oozing pus, deeply debilitating. Infants suffering from this ailment carry the toxins from the parents&#39; wombs. Sweating medications, oral medications, and topical treatments are advisable. Avoid pill medications, as they may contain light powder that can ease recovery too easily, whereas this light powder, derived from mercury, can corrupt the intestines and bones, causing significant harm.</p>
<p><strong>Xue&#39;s Medical Cases</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reversal Flower</strong><br><strong>[For sores with fleshy growths protruding]</strong><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The condition known as &quot;flipping sore&quot; arises after ulcers rupture, caused by liver heat and dry blood generating wind. Sometimes the wound forms flesh like a fungus, varying in size; at other times, it appears like a snake&#39;s head, differing in length. The treatment should nourish the liver and replenish qi, applying a corydalis paste externally, allowing the flesh to recede. One must wait for the vital energy to gradually recover and the pus and toxins to diminish; otherwise, while it may initially recede, it could rupture again. If one mistakenly uses knives, needles, cautery, or heat, the heat can increase significantly, leading to uncontrollable bleeding and potentially resulting in symptoms like chills, fever, and vomiting. Therefore, it is imperative to greatly nourish the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>For celestial blisters:</p>
<p>If the pulse is floating, with fever or stiffness, one should disperse the exterior pathogens. If the pulse is deep with fever and constipation, one should resolve the exterior and attack the interior. If there is fever with red, painful urination, one should dissipate heat and detoxify. This is associated with insufficient vital energy, as pathogens have taken advantage; it may also be infectious, affecting the liver and kidney channels, thus often appearing in the lower body. Some patients experience pain in the muscles and bones first, then fall ill, while others face illness before experiencing pain. Initially, the pulse is floating and rapid, indicating pathogens in the spleen and lung channels; one should first use Jingfang Baidu San to disperse. If the pulse is wiry and rapid, indicating pathogens in the liver and gallbladder channels, one should use Longdan Xiegan Tang to clear and resolve it. If the pulse is deep and rapid, indicating pathogens in the viscera, one should start with Neishuhuanglian Tang to regulate, followed by Huanku Xiaodu San as the primary treatment, ensuring no subsequent pain in the muscles and bones. If the sore is raised, red, and painful, it indicates a strong heat toxicity; if it pains slightly, the toxicity is lethal. If the sore is white and does not crust, it suggests deficiency of yang; if it is red and does not crust, it suggests deficiency of yin blood.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Itching, with a weak and floating pulse, indicates that the qi cannot nourish one another; scratching, with a floating and rapid pulse, indicates that the blood cannot nourish one another. Itching occurring between the buttocks or the neck suggests deficiency of the bladder yin. Itching between the genitalia or inner thighs indicates blood deficiency in the liver channel. Severe drooping and itching of the scrotum indicates damp-heat and yin deficiency in the liver channel. Frequent and scanty urination that is red suggests yin deficiency in the liver channel. Frequent and scanty urination that is white suggests deficiency of spleen and lung qi. Itching or reddening of the face indicates an external pathogen affecting the body. Itching between the eyebrows or hair loss indicates dryness of the liver and gallbladder blood. Reduced appetite and thinking about food, with thirst for soup, indicate deficiency of the stomach qi. Difficulty in digesting food and loose stools suggest deficiency of spleen qi. Diarrhea in the early morning or at night indicates deficiency of spleen and kidney. If treated improperly, it could lead to damage to the eyes, rotting of the jade stalk, or cramping of the limbs; in such cases, one may use the Nine Flavor Aloe Vera Pills to clear liver fire, the Six Flavor Pills to nourish kidney water, and the Quenching and Detoxifying Decoction to nourish blood and expel pathogens, which can be effective. However, if one mistakenly uses arsenic or similar remedies, it will lead to more challenging conditions.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Yangmei</strong></p>
<p>For conditions dominated by dampness, it is advisable to first treat the dampness. For exterior excess, one should first resolve the exterior, and for interior excess, one should first disperse the interior. If both the exterior and interior are excess, one should resolve the exterior and address the interior simultaneously. If the exterior is deficient, one should tonify Qi; if the interior is deficient, one should tonify blood; if both the exterior and interior are deficient, then one should tonify both Qi and blood.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Guidelines</strong><br>(Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tianpao</strong></p>
<p>Tianpao sores, similar to dan poison, arise from the relationship of the Heaven Phase and the Least Yang being deficient. Thus, they are named Tianpao. They occur as fiery heat accumulates between the skin and cannot be released outward, resulting in the heat transforming the blood, leading to the formation of sores that resemble bean sores, with red roots and white heads, or often red heads, appearing in various places. If the condition manifests from the interior to the exterior, especially in spring and summer, and if all three burners are hot, then one should take Tongsheng San. If it arises solely from the head, neck, and arms, then it signifies heat in the upper burner, and one should take Liangge San. If it arises from the waist down, then one should take Huanglian Jiedu and He Shiyu Decoction. If it appears in autumn and winter, one should use Shengma, Gekgen, and Xijiao, and may add one or two additional herbs such as Fan and Qin; topical applications like Portulaca, Isatis, red adzuki beans, and ramie root can also be used to detoxify and reduce swelling during the initial onset. Additionally, shells or tortoise shells, or Hydrocotyle, when calcined for retention, can absorb dampness and promote tissue regeneration, suitable for cases that have become chronic.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Yangmei</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked, &quot;What about the wide sores?&quot; I said: &quot;These are due to damp heat in the liver and kidney meridians, possibly from excessive lust, leading to kidney deficiency, which causes it to be contaminated by evil and filthy qi. Alternatively, it may stem from syphilis that harbors toxins, lingering and persisting, causing this condition. It is also known as &#39;turning flower sore,&#39; where the flesh protrudes outward, resembling a waxy color and resembling cotton flowers; therefore, it is also called &#39;cotton flower sore.&#39; This indicates an abundance of evil toxins. Minor cases are referred to as &#39;wide beans,&#39; or they may resemble red-root pus cavities, indicating milder toxins. </p>
<p>For those afflicted with this condition, it is advisable to first consume detoxifying substances to induce results, followed by taking formulas like Tong Sheng San, ensuring the use of earth Poria should be stopped for a while. Once the toxins have been eradicated, formulas like Ba Zhen Tang or Shi Quan Da Bu Tang can be taken to replenish qi and blood. Strict adherence to dietary restrictions is essential for full recovery. Avoiding sexual activity is critical; any violation will render the medication ineffective.**<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Consider the following cautions: First, avoid sour vinegar, as it can bind evil toxins, leading to widespread skin issues. Second, avoid white intestines, which can generate stagnant heat and cause persistent conditions. Third, avoid light powders and cold water, as they can lead to joint pain and form wind lumps, which may appear after one or two years or even several years, appearing hard with a pale flesh color, causing pain or itching, often forming around joints and areas where meridians converge, and if broken, can result in oozing pus, which is quite dreadful. In less severe cases, it can manifest as widespread skin issues, also known as &quot;thousand-layered ringworm,&quot; commonly appearing on the palms and soles, overlapping continuously. There is also residual toxicity, known as &quot;qi toxicity,&quot; causing fluctuating pain in the muscles and bones, as well as &quot;damp toxicity,&quot; resulting in intermittent muscle and joint aches. Treatment should be tailored based on severity. Begin with detoxifying and dispelling evil winds, then follow with restorative tonics. For severe sores or deep toxic accumulations, it is necessary to use fumigation therapies; afterward, take Tongsheng San to dispel fire toxins, followed by restorative tonics like Ba Zhen Tang. Those who are weak should avoid fumigation to prevent being overwhelmed by excessive heat.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Wai Ke Zheng Zong</strong> (By Chen Shigong, Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Turning Flowers</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Turning flowers&quot; refers to a condition where the head is large but the stem is small, the small ones resemble beans, and the large ones are like fungi. They are neither painful nor bitter. When wiped, they bleed fresh blood, and over time, they can make a person weak. Mix saliva with ice-cold powder and apply it generously on the front, then wrap it in soft oil paper. For finer roots, tightly bind them with cotton and paper. After ten days, the affliction will fall off naturally. Then, use pearl powder mixed in to help the wound close. There are also those with a root not small, resembling a turtle or chess piece, which are hard to bind. For these, apply medicine first, then seal with dough and soft paper in two layers. Be careful not to move it; after ten days, it will also fall off, followed by pearl powder.</p>
<p><strong>Sky Blisters</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Sky blisters&quot; are caused by excessive heart fire with accompanying spleen dampness. There are different manifestations in the upper and lower body, influenced by slight changes in cold and hot weather. For the upper body, where wind heat is more prevalent than damp heat, it is advisable to cool the blood and disperse the wind. For the lower body, where damp heat is more pronounced than wind heat, it is best to focus on dispersing dampness first. Applying external powder such as hu fen (calamine) or stone pearl powder can lead to self-healing. If not treated early, it may develop into stubborn wind purpura, which is difficult to cure.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Overview of Yangmei Sores</strong></p>
<p>Yangmei sores are named for their resemblance to the yangmei fruit, and also known as seasonal sores due to their occurrence in response to changing weather and invasion by pathogenic qi. They are also called cotton flower sores because they are persistent and difficult to eliminate. These terms stem from the transformation caused by damp heat and malignant fire, with cases of qi transformation being mild and those of essence transformation being severe. </p>
<p>Qi transformation affects the spleen and lungs, presenting primarily in the upper body with symptoms such as itching skin and no pain in the muscles and bones, characterized by small and dry sores. Essence transformation affects the liver and kidneys, exhibiting symptoms primarily in the lower body with significant pain in the muscles and bones, and frequent urination, characterized by large and hard sores. </p>
<p>For qi transformation, where the toxin resides in the skin without penetrating deeper, it is advisable to take universal elixirs, bathe to induce sweating, and disperse the skin toxins. For essence transformation, where the toxin is in the bone marrow but has not yet penetrated the skin, one should take the Nine Dragon Pill to promote urination and expel the toxins from the bones. In severe cases, both treatments can be applied. </p>
<p>After dispersing the toxins, if the patient is robust, they may take a detoxifying decoction; if weak, a nourishing internal dispersing powder should be used. Once the pain in the muscles and bones ceases and the sores fade to a pale color, confirming that the internal toxins have been resolved, one may proceed to apply topical medicines. Recovery can range from six months for mild cases to a year for severe cases. </p>
<p>Patients who do not adhere to this method, seeking rapid recovery through random applications of fumigants, rubbing medicines, or inhalation techniques, often end up complicating their condition greatly.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Initially, there is no headache, the muscles and bones do not ache, the urination is unobstructed, and the sores are small and dry; these are mild cases. If sores appear with few on the face and mouth, and the neck and back have numerous sores but the groin is clear, treatment is possible. If sores develop into inguinal chancres and subsequently cause pains in the muscles and bones, the sores are not favorable; if they appear red, purple, and hard, and there are many on the hands and feet, resembling blisters from boiling water, the condition is serious.</p>
<p>Treatment methods:<br>At the onset, begin with clearing the heat and dampness, next address the muscle and bone pain, and then treat the sores, employing a purging approach. If there are no external chancres and no internal muscle or bone pain caused by environmental factors, treat mildly. Sores arising from unclean sexual contact lead to chancres, and if urination is obstructed, guiding the flow is necessary. If there is itching in the upper parts with many sores, clear the wind and heat; if there is severe pain and itching in the lower parts, prioritize draining dampness. For severe high sores that are red and purple, cool the blood and detoxify; for lighter, thinner sores that are pale, treat them with both capture and attack. For dried skin on the hands and feet, resembling goosefoot, a decoction of white cedar leaves and two alum for fumigation and washing will suffice. If hair and eyebrows fall out due to oily wind, there’s no need for lengthy discussion; nourishing the true essence with an elixir is recommended for early treatment. For scattered superficial fungal infections and patches of rough skin, it is suitable to take muscle-replacement pills, which will yield results akin to sweeping clean.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Tian Pao</strong></p>
<p>Tian Pao sores resemble water blisters, thin and moist in appearance. They may occur on the head and face, or be widespread across the body. They are caused by the yin and yang wind-heat, hence they are found between the skin and muscle. It is advisable to clear the blood and cool it; when the heat resolves, healing will occur. If accompanied by exterior pathogenic factors and fever with a rapid pulse, it is advisable to use Jing Fang Bai Du San. If there is strong fire, one may add Qinqin, Lian, Lianqiao, Jin Yinhua, and Yuan Shen. If there is swelling, pain, a rapid pulse, and a firm condition, both the exterior and interior are affected; use Fang Feng Tong Sheng San for dual resolution. If there is excessive toxic water outside, apply Jin Huang San as a poultice, there will be no case that does not heal.</p>
<p><strong>Yang Mei</strong></p>
<p>Yang Mei sores are named for their swollen, protruding red and rotten appearance, resembling the yangmei fruit. In the northwest, they are called Tian Pao sores, while in the southeast, they are referred to as Guangdong sores. Typically, lighter and smaller toxins are like the fruit of the zhuyu plant, hence known as Zhuyu sores. When the toxin is severe and large, decaying fearfully and resembling cotton, they are called Mianhua sores. Generally, this condition arises from the transmission of excessive toxins. Such filthy toxins arise after seminal leakage, where the qi travels through the seminal pathway, penetrating directly through the life gate into the chong vessel, thus affecting both the surface and internal structures, from skin to bone marrow. Wherever the chong vessel reaches, hazards are profound and malevolent. If detoxification is insufficient from the onset, or treatment is inappropriate, it often leads to severe decay and loss of life, a situation that is not rare.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Perhaps after two or three decades, it still manifests as madness or poison, causing rotten heads, rotten noses, the extremities or hidden places to stink and decay beyond remedy, or inflicting lasting ailments on children, the severity of such harm is evident! Reflecting quietly, those who see this harmful path yet remain untroubled and do not strive to avoid it show great foolishness. Thus, in all methods of treatment, it is most essential to understand the critical points and exercise caution. There are also cases where the illness is not transmitted through lewdness but arises from damp heat, which is confined to the skin and muscles; eliminating the damp heat will lead to complete recovery, with no cause for concern.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when people encounter this poison, whether fearing exposure or the severity of the poison itself, they often resort to aggressive and harsh medications, which frequently result in the evil poison remaining while their vital energy deteriorates first, possibly leading to tuberculosis, immediate death, or worsening conditions that spiral out of control—this is all due to the prior decline of their vital energy, of which I have witnessed much. Therefore, anyone afflicted by this illness must not panic, nor should they attack aggressively; instead, they should gradually resolve the poison according to proper methods, ensuring that their vital energy is not harmed at all, which indeed allows them to overcome the evil. Even a mild poison can kill if one’s defenses are weak. This is the key point and should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Method for Treating Ulcers:</strong> When an ulcer first appears and the original Yang energy is not harmed, and the poison is not serious, it is advisable to quickly use clearing and purging methods to expel the poison through small disturbances. The top remedy for this is the &quot;Change Skin and Dissolve Poison Powder.&quot; Following that, the &quot;Five-Flower Bark Decoction&quot; is also effective. If there is a combination with fire pathogens, the &quot;Secret Immortal&#39;s Remaining Grain Decoction&quot; should be used. For those weak in constitution, &quot;Poria Paste&quot; is recommended. Any of these remedies may show effects within ten days, half a month, or even up to a month.</p>
<p>For those who develop poisonous ulcers, it is advisable to consume two to three liters of locust flower pistils, which will help expel the poison through urination, thus averting lifelong troubles—this is a genuine divine formula.</p>
<p>When an ulcer first appears, there is often an initial discharge of yin dampness, followed by toxin in the urine, and then the ulcer appears—this completes a cycle. If the toxin causes significant swelling and pain, resulting in heat retention but the original qi being strong, one should use &quot;Gathering Pus Powder&quot; or &quot;Oyster Shell Powder&quot; to first eliminate the force of the poison, followed by the previous remedies.</p>
<p>If the ulcer persists without healing, whether due to generally weak original qi or because of excessive depletion leading to deficiency, it is important to assess the situation correctly. If there is a clear imbalance with the righteous qi unable to withstand the evil, focus primarily on restoring the original qi. The remedies for the spleen and kidney&#39;s yin and yang, as well as the qi and blood, should all be used according to symptoms, ensuring that the qi and blood are restored; then even if the poison is present, it will not cause harm.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>One must be wary of perceiving things that are not true and clinging to extremes, as this ultimately leads to no benefit; this is a crucial point. Regarding food and drink, some say certain foods should be avoided while others argue they should not be restricted; thus, one must discern the essentials. When a wound is newly infected, and the poison is not yet severe, it is best to use clearing and purging methods to gradually eliminate the poison. However, if one consumes food that aggravates the condition, the poison will only increase, making it a time for avoidance. If the wound infection has persisted for a long time, the vital energy is already weak, with pus accumulating and blood energy depleted. At this time, unless one uses nourishing medicines and foods, the conditions will worsen day by day; therefore, in this case, one should not avoid food. The principles of what to avoid and what not to avoid, as well as what to supplement and what not to supplement, are essential. Without the ability to discern, how can one avoid mistakes?</p>
<p>For wounds on the head or face, or in hard-to-treat areas across the body, to speed up healing, one might apply ointment; with this method, after two or three days, the scab may fall off, which seems miraculous, but this is merely a symptomatic treatment. </p>
<p>When a wound infection is long-standing, it can transform into a wind-induced toxin known as Yangmei boil or sore. It may erode muscles or attach to bones, leading to incessant decay, which is the worst outcome. Recently, the most effective treatment has been the Five Treasure Pill, along with Xu Donggao&#39;s formula for Yangmei boil or a secret mercury ointment, which should be chosen wisely for use.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Toxic Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Toxic accumulation refers to the condition where the poison from wounds is confined by heat and penetrates into the bone marrow. Additionally, if one does not undergo proper fumigation and scraping, and notices the initial signs of the ailment without taking sufficient medication, the internal poison may not be fully expelled. If one then uses topical medicine to constrict and restrain the toxic qi, this too can lead to the same condition. </p>
<p>Initially, it manifests as pain in the muscles and bones, which gradually swells over time, with no area spared from the outbreak. If it occurs in the joints, it can damage tendons and bones, making movement difficult even if the body later heals. An outbreak around the mouth and nose may lead to facial deformities. If the throat is affected, it can alter the voice; if in the hands and feet, it hinders walking. The suffering is lifelong, and the toxic legacy may affect several generations. </p>
<p>A small error in judgment can lead to numerous calamities. At the onset, with significant pain in the muscles and bones, consuming a jade toad shell elixir may induce perspiration for self-healing. For those who are weak, a decoction of Chuanxiong and Atractylodes may be utilized, while those suffering intense headaches may benefit from Tianma cakes or inhaling Biyun powder. For conditions lasting over a year where muscle and bone pain persists, a Five-Treasure powder is recommended. </p>
<p>For the weak, if there is persistent ulceration and pain, a Decocted Ten Complements herbal formula combined with raw poria should be administered. For those experiencing intense initial pain in the muscles and bones, the Thunder Fire Needle method is appropriate. For ulcers that have already rotted, detoxifying Zijing ointment should be applied according to established treatment methods. </p>
<p>In cases where the condition has persisted for many years and the poison is severe, Yuanwu Dan along with topical therapeutic agents should be used. For more recent cases not exceeding a hundred days, they may naturally recover without further fumigation, for this would bring harm. Treatment methods should align with the principles for Yangmei sore symptoms.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Recipe</p>

<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji,&quot; it states: Judge Zhang Cheng&#39;en suffered from a carbuncle in his groin, which was about to heal, when a piece of flesh resembling a fungus turned out. I said: This is due to wind-heat dryness in the liver meridian; it should clear liver heat and nourish liver blood. He disagreed, so internally he used medications to lower fire and externally applied corrosives. The flesh corroded but then began to grow back; as it grew larger, his vitality diminished, and he began to believe my words. Therefore, he took the Gardenia Liver Clearing Powder internally and applied the Euphorbia Ointment externally, resulting in recovery. </p>
<p>Another instance involved a patient with a dislike for Liang (fine rice) who became angry, leading to a lump forming under the ear. It ruptured and the sore opened like a fungus, causing headaches, and sometimes bloating in the chest and sides, or experiencing heat and cold internally. Despite using heat-clearing and detoxifying medicines, it did not heal for over a year. I then used the Middle-strength Energy-boosting Decoction and the Six-Ingredient Rehmannia Pill, and he recovered shortly thereafter.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>A man had a sore on his back, about the size of a bean, with exposed flesh over an inch long. Using a method of absorption and incision, it would repeatedly diminish and then enlarge. This was due to deficiency of liver meridian blood and wind-heat; I used a refined version of Xiao Yao San for over thirty doses, applying Li Lu Gao to facilitate healing, and then used Ba Zhen San, increasing the amounts of ren shen, qi, gui, and zhu to help it close.</p>
<p>A woman, known for her temper, had a carbuncle on her arm, with exposed flesh about two inches long. This was due to a stagnation of liver and spleen from anger, along with deficient qi and blood leading to internal wind. I prescribed a refined version of Xiao Yao San and applied Li Lu Gao, resulting in recovery. Later, due to anger, she experienced swelling and discomfort at the site, with sweating profusely like rain. This was again wind-heat in the liver meridian, causing the qi to disperse. I continued with the previous formula and added Ba Zhen Tang, leading to her recovery.</p>
<p>A man had swelling in his neck, with excess phlegm. Using a formula to disperse and promote qi flow worsened the hard swelling, causing wheezing, heat, spontaneous sweating, and fatigue with reduced appetite. I remarked this indicated deficiency in the three yin channels of the leg, thus needing a boost to the source of transformation. When I doubted his condition, he opened and exposed the affected area about six inches in length; the color was rocky red, and blood was fresh and flowed for over three months. His liver pulse was taut and full. I prescribed Da Bu Tang with added Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi for over fifty doses, gradually seeing improvements in his symptoms, and the bleeding halted three to four times. Afterward, due to anger, his appetite suddenly decreased, and blood gushed forth once more, indicating his liver could not consolidate and his spleen could not control. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang as the main treatment, adding Wu Wei Zi and Mai Men Dong, which immediately stopped the bleeding. I also prescribed Liu Wei Wan combined with Wu Wei Zi for regular use, and the sore closed to about an inch; he eventually stopped all medication and did not adhere to dietary restrictions, leading to his demise.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>A child suffered from blisters, experiencing heat and pain, with a rapid floating pulse.

Upon checking his pulse, which was deep and firm, it was determined that the evil was internal. A single dose of Fangfeng Tongsheng San was administered, resulting in immediate recovery, followed by two doses of Jingfang Baiduxiao for stabilization. Although this condition is attributed to wind-heat, one must carefully consider both exterior and interior treatment to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>Mao Ge Lao Sun, over ten years old, had several blisters on his back and sides, with fever and a rapid pulse. This was due to wind-heat affecting the lungs and stomach, known as Tianpao Chuang.

Every day, he applied crushed garlic to the affected areas and used moxibustion. After a while, he switched to using medicated plaster for a few days, which showed some improvement; he then used a soybean paste for moxibustion and also took Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, eventually leading to a cure. For any swelling or pain, he also used garlic for moxibustion, applied a soothing ointment, and took restorative medicine.</p>

<p>A woman with similar ailments ultimately healed, but her two legs each had a sore the size of a palm, accompanied by painful cramps in the muscles and bones. She had not healed for three years, various medications were ineffective, and she experienced intense heat in the afternoons with little appetite. Using a combination of Bi Xie Decoction and Xiao Yao San, with increased amounts of Poria and Atractylodes, several doses alleviated her heat and improved her appetite. She also applied a special ointment and took Ba Zhen Tang with additional doses of Achyranthes, Eucommia, and Papaya over thirty doses, eventually recovering.</p>
<p>A scholar presented with similar symptoms, experiencing redness and pain, with constipation that was ineffective. After taking medications to dispel wind and eliminate toxins, he had tongue pain and dry mouth, with a pulse that was floating and rapid. This indicated the departure of evil qi, leading to a deficiency of yin. He was treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, supplemented with Gardenia and Angelica for four doses, after which his pulse and symptoms significantly improved. He was then given Ba Zhen Tang with added Gardenia and Moutan, and the color of the sore gradually turned white; later, he took Si Jun Zi Tang with Angelica and Astragalus and was cured.</p>
<p>Another patient took medicine to attack the toxins, resulting in a protrusion at the affected area, redness and pain, and feelings of fatigue and chills coupled with fever, with a floating and weak pulse. This indicated damage to the original qi and the presence of evil qi. He was treated with two doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and recovered.</p>
<p>A scholar mistakenly took medicine to dispel wind and detoxify, which harmed his original qi. Due to excessive labor, he developed internal heat and dry mouth, with swollen and painful gums, his right wrist pulse was abundant and rapid yet weak.

He used light powder and vermilion among other medicines, and developed lumps about two inches in size on his head, face, arms, and buttocks, which ulcerated, weakening his vitality. He experienced cold and heat, dry mouth, cracked lips, dribbling urination, phlegm rising, and a diminished appetite. This indicated that the spleen and stomach were injured, causing weakness in the organs and excess fire. He took over twenty doses of Six Gentlemen Decoction, followed by a combination of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Shan Zhuang Yu, Shan Yao, Mai Men Dong, and Wu Wei Zi, which restored his stomach qi and alleviated the symptoms; however, his urination did not fully clear, and phlegm persisted, leading to the use of modified Eight Flavor Pill until he was cured.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar suffered from itching on his head and face; it appeared as bumps, patches, or weeping lesions. The pulses of the spleen and lungs were rapid, indicating damage from wind pathogen. He first used Jing Fang Bai Du San with additions of Bi Xie and Gou Teng, and gradually improved with several doses. But due to dry mouth and internal heat, he applied Si Wu Decoction with additions of Shan Zhi, Gou Teng, Jin Yin Hua, and Gan Cao Jie for recovery. Later, he experienced full-body itching, internal heat, and dry mouth, for which he supplemented with Six Flavor Pill until he was healed.</p>
<p>The &quot;Orthodox Text of Surgery&quot; states: A man suffered from Yangmei sores for more than two months and, after self-administering a cooling detoxifying agent without improvement, experienced pain in his muscles and bones, with an internal and external mix of cold. This caused the toxin to sink and become difficult to expel, necessitating the use of warming spices. He took Wan Ling Dan and boiled it with scallion wine, performing baths over it. Initially, he broke out in a cold sweat like rain, followed by hot sweats, which reduced the pain significantly. After taking Gui Ling Decoction for more than a month, the sores began to stabilize. He then used Bixie Decoction in conjunction with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and after more than two additional months, he was eventually healed.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a painful illness after her husband had a sore, which caused her muscles and bones to ache severely. When she was exposed to the cold at night, she took four doses of a decoction to dispel toxins, which alleviated the cold, but the pain persisted. She then took a sweat-inducing remedy twice, which resulted in only small spots like beans appearing on her head, face, and back, indicating the severity of the toxin. To alleviate this, she took two doses of a remedy to unblock and promote urination. After adding other ingredients, including soapwort and honeysuckle, and taking more than ten doses, her sores gradually enlarged, with smaller ones resembling coins and larger ones like cups, exuding foul pus and causing unbearable pain when getting up or sitting down. Externally, she applied a powder to the wounds, but they remained swollen and infected. Internally, she took a modified remedy for over two months before the sores began to dry up; the lighter cases healed and fell off, while the more serious cases took another six months to recover fully.</p>
<p>A scholar had a sore from a type of fruit for over a month and sought a quick cure. I told him this illness was unlike others, and if he sought a rapid cure, he would certainly leave behind residual toxins. I declined to treat him. He sought another doctor who promised to cure him in half a month without any future problems, which made him very happy. Using mercury and copper sulfate among other medicines, he applied them to his hands and feet. Within two weeks, the sore did indeed heal. However, soon after, he experienced bone pain, and no medicines seemed to help. Six months later, toxins emerged internally, causing severe infection, with pain so intense he could barely bear it; his legs were covered with sores, and there was not a single area without them. Another two years passed, leaving his legs bent and permanently crooked, eventually turning into a chronic ailment for life, compounded by complete deafness.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>A courtesan suffered from a yangmei sore and wished to recover quickly, so she treated it with smoke from medicine.

He was treated with thunder-fire needles, applying them to one small and three large swollen areas. Seven days later, pus and necrosis developed. He took the Xian Yi Liang decoction internally, and after two months, his pain gradually subsided, and the swelling began to diminish. After another two months, the necrosis completely healed, and new flesh grew. He then took the Six Great Nourishing Decoction, and after three months, he had fully recovered.</p>
<p>Another man had toxic swelling in the penis for six months, with the condition already affecting seven or eight parts. He encountered a master practitioner who treated him with smoking medicine, but the swelling caused him to bleed incessantly, leaving him looking ghost-like. I said: the poison has already harmed the vital energy; adding more heat from smoke will make the blood go rogue, resulting in significant losses. Blood is a limited resource; thus I feared it would be hard to save. I first used Si Wu Decoction combined with Huang Lian Detoxifying Decoction, and after six doses, his bleeding stopped. I then administered Ba Zhen Decoction with additional Mai Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Huang Bo, and Zhi Mu over ten or more doses, stabilizing his vital energy. Externally, I had him bathe the swollen area with Gan Cao Decoction and apply silver powder. After about a month of this treatment, his vital energy and blood gradually revived, red flesh began to grow, and his member regained over half of its size. I continued with the previous decoction, adding two liang of Tu Fu Ling to the brew, not neglecting the root cause. In total, this process took about four months before he was cured.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>A man suffered from a toxic accumulation, with a headache so severe it felt like his head would break, especially at night.

After taking it for three doses, the pain gradually subsided. After more than ten doses, his illness was completely resolved and did not recur.</p>
<p>Another man suffered from a toxic accumulation that caused decay and rot below his knees, with no space free from it. He rested on a pillow for half a year. Internally, I administered a formula of Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Atractylodes, while externally he applied a wash made from licorice, white angelica, the tail of angelica, and green onion, applying it every three days. He also used detoxifying purple gold ointment. After more than three months of this treatment, he gradually improved. However, he could not walk. I used a medicinal wine from Duke Shi, adding a pound of earthy Poria, which was then boiled and consumed for another half-year, after which he could finally walk; after one more treatment, he was able to walk as he used to.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>A woman suffered from accumulated toxins, experiencing pain in her head and wrists. Upon examination, her pulse was slippery and taut. This was a case of phlegm and toxin intertwining. She took Tianma cake, and within half a month, her headaches were cured. Additionally, she used Erchen decoction combined with Siwu decoction, adding safflower, Shengma, and Huangqin, and continued this for over a month until she recovered.</p>
<p>A man suffered from accumulated toxins, with his forehead rotting. He applied detoxifying Zijing ointment externally and took Bixie decoction internally, and after more than two months, he was healed. Another person had this issue in his calf for over a year but was cured using the previous remedies.</p>
<p>A woman had accumulated toxins causing damage to her throat for six months, making it difficult for her to take medicine, and she nearly died. She took the detoxifying Zijing pill and applied detoxifying spirit externally. Within a month, her illness was resolved. Another woman suffered from swelling and pain in her shoulder and back for six or seven years, and none of the various medicines worked. She still took the previous remedies and found relief.</p>
<p>A man suffered from accumulated toxins, with his throat rotting. I prescribed Yiliang decoction for internal use and an external detoxifying and wound-healing medicine. He thought it was too slow, so he used fumigation remedies, which worsened his condition, leading to mouth sores, pure black blood in his stool, generalized swelling, refusal to eat, and severe muscle breakdown, ultimately resulting in his death after three months.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>The &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; states: I once treated a young man who, after a chance encounter with foul toxins, suddenly contracted a sore at the tip of his penis. It began to ulcerate, and treatments were ineffective. The infection spread from the mouth of the urethra into the urinary tract, gradually deepening until it reached the anus. The swelling and pain became like fish bones, and at night there would be a blockage of pus that could not be expelled. If I lubricated him to help release it, first pus would come out and then urine, but treatments failed to reach it, which was quite alarming.</p>
<p>I came across an old man in the mountains who applied a formula made from locust flower petals, and within ten days, the root of the problem began to heal. After half a month, it healed from the inside out, and by the time it retreated to the mouth of the urethra, he was completely cured. After the ulcer healed, there were some minor sores remaining, and I gave him a decoction made from the bark of the Wujia tree for over ten doses, and he was completely healed.</p>
<p>The person who applied the formula said: This recipe is excellent for treating sores caused by indulgence and hot toxins, all of which are expelled through urine, which is why it can treat these sores. However, anyone who takes this may be spared from future sores and toxins for life. Nonetheless, there is still a remarkable detoxifying effect that occurs at the onset of the sores. If one sees sudden red patches all over the body, which vanish after a few days, these are indications of the emergence of toxin-related sores. When the toxins are expelled, the sores may still be visible, which serves as proof. Initially, I did not believe this, but when this person&#39;s sores appeared while those red patches were indeed present all over his body and disappeared after two days, I came to understand the miraculous power of the medicine.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<p>外科反花天泡杨梅门</p>
<p>　　　　疮疡全书 【宋　窦汉卿】<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<p>　　　　　天泡</p>
<p>　　此疮之发，不拘老幼，皆由受酷暑热毒之气，蒸入肌肉，初生一疱，渐至遍体漫烂无休，合家相染。此证须要净汤淋洗，切勿以秽气触之。内服清肌燥湿汤，外用泥金刮毒膏。<br>　　　　　杨梅</p>
<p>　　一名广东疮，一名霉疮，皆脏腑之积毒，脾家之湿热。其起也有三因，男子与生疳疮妇人交，熏其毒气而生；或体虚气弱，偶遇生疮之人，秽气入于肠胃而生；或先患疮之人，在于客厕，去后，其毒气尚浮于客厕之中，不知偶犯，其毒气熏入孔中，渐至脏腑。或在头顶中，或在肋下，或粪门边先起，有雄有雌：雄者大如白果，遍身生五六十或百枚，分颗不成片；雌者小如豆瓣，遍身连片，脓汁淋漓，深能累人。婴儿患此者，皆父母胎中之毒也。宜用汗药，宜用服药，宜用搽药。不可服丸剂，恐内藏轻粉易愈故也。但轻粉乃水银升者，腐肠烂骨，害不旋踵。<br>　　　　薛氏医案 【明　薛己】</p>
<p>　　　　　反花 【疮有胬肉凸出者是】<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>　　翻花疮者，由疮疡溃后，肝火血燥生风所致。或疮口胬肉突出如菌，大小不同；或出如蛇头，长短不一。治法当滋肝补气，外涂藜芦膏，胬肉自入。须候元气渐复，脓毒将尽，涂之有效。不然，虽入而复溃。若误用刀针蚀药灸火，其热益甚，或出血不止，必致寒热呕吐等证。须大补脾胃为善。<br>　　　　　天泡</p>
<p>　　脉浮发热或拘急者，发散表邪。脉沉发热便秘者，解表攻里。发热小便赤濇者，分利消毒。　　属元气不足，邪气所乘，亦有传染而患，受证在肝肾二经，故多在下体发起。有先筋骨痛而后患者，有先患而后痛者。初起脉浮数，邪在脾肺经也，先用荆防败毒散解散之。脉弦数，邪在肝胆经也，先用龙胆泻肝汤清解之。脉沉数，邪在脏腑也，先用内疏黄连汤通导之，后用换肌消毒散为主，愈后再无筋骨疼痛之患。若疮凸赤作痛，热毒炽盛也；疮微作痛，毒将杀也。疮色白而不结痂，阳气虚也；色赤而不结痂，阴血虚也。<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>瘙痒，脉虚浮，气不能相荣也；搔痒，脉浮数，血不能相荣也。臀背间或颈间作痒，膀胱阴虚也。阴器间或股内痒，肝经血虚也。阴囊作痒重坠，肝经阴虚湿热也。小便频数，短少色赤，肝经阴虚也。小便频数，色白短少，脾肺气虚也。面目瘙痒或变赤，外邪相搏也。眉间痒或毛落，肝胆血燥也。饮食少思，口渴饮汤，胃气虚也。饮食难化，大便不实，脾气虚也。侵晨或夜间泄泻，脾肾虚也。若治失其法，有蚀伤眼目，腐烂玉茎，拳挛肢体者，但用九味芦荟丸以清肝火，六味丸以生肾水，蠲痹解毒饮以养血祛邪，亦有可愈者。若误用轻粉等剂，反为难治。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　　杨梅</p>

<p>　　　　　天泡</p>
<p>　　天泡疮，即丹毒之类而有者，由天行少阳相少为病，故名天泡。为火热客于皮肤间，外不得泄，热怫血液，结而成泡，如碗豆疮，根赤头白，或头亦赤，随处而起。若自里达于外，发在春夏，三焦俱热，则服通圣散。若止从头项两手起者，此上焦热也，则服凉膈散。若从身半以下起者，则服黄连解毒和四物汤。若发于秋冬，则宜升麻、葛根、犀角，或加蘗、芩一二味；外敷如马齿苋、吴蓝、赤小豆，苎根之类，皆解毒消肿，可用于初起之时。或蚶壳或龟甲、水龙骨，各煅存性，则收湿生肌，可用于浸淫之后。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　　杨梅</p>
<p>　　或问广疮何如？曰：此肝肾二经湿热，或色欲太过，肾经虚损，感邪秽之气而成：或因下疳畜毒，缠绵不已而作。　一名翻花疮，肉反于外，状如蜡色，有如绵花，故又名绵花疮，此则邪毒盛。细小者名广豆，或如赤根脓窠，此则邪毒浅。凡患此证，先宜食毒物以发之，后服通圣散之类，须用土茯苓对停服；毒势既杀，八珍十全大补汤之类以补气血。必守禁忌，方获全愈。大忌房劳，如犯之，服药不效。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>虑后结毒，一忌酸酢，酸敛邪毒，后结广癣；一忌白肠，能发郁火，以致缠绵不已；一忌轻粉及冷水，致后筋骨疼痛，结成风块，或一二年或数年方发，其状坚硬，肉色平淡，或痛或痒，多结于骨节头面喉鼻之间，经络交会之处，已破则脓水淋漓，甚可畏也。轻则发广癣，亦名千层癣，多生手心足底，重迭不已。又有余毒，亦名气毒，筋骨疼痛，来去不定，亦名湿毒，筋骨痛酸，乍作乍止，宜随其浅深治之。先服消风败毒，后服补剂。疮势盛及结毒深者，必用熏药；后服通圣散以泄火毒；后服八珍汤大补汤之类。弱者不宜熏，恐不能胜火气也。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　　　外科正宗 【明　陈实功】</p>
<p>　　　　　翻花</p>
<p>　　翻花者，乃头大而蒂小，小者如豆，大者若菌，无苦无疼，揩之每流鲜血，久亦虚人。以唾津调冰蛳散，遍擦正面，上用软油纸包裹；根蒂细处，用绵连纸扎紧，十日后，其患自落，换珍珠散掺之收口。又有根蒂不小，如鳖棋子样，难扎，以前药搽上，用面糊绵纸封上二重，用心勿动，亦以十日乃落，掺珍珠散。<br>　　　　　天泡</p>
<p>　　天泡者，乃心火妄动，脾湿随之，有身体上下之不同，寒热天气之微异。上体者，风热多于湿热，宜凉血散风。下体者，湿热多于风热，宜渗湿为先。外用胡粉散、石珍珠散搽之自愈。此不早治，变为顽风紫癜，则难痊矣。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>　　　　　杨梅疮总论</p>
<p>　　夫杨梅疮者，以其形似杨梅，又名时疮，因时气乖变，邪气凑袭；又名绵花疮，以其绵绵难绝。有此三者之称，总由湿热邪火之化，但气化传染者轻，精化欲染者重。故气化乃脾肺受毒，其患先从上部见之，皮肤作痒，筋骨不疼，其形小而且干；精化乃肝肾受毒，其患先从下部见之，筋骨多疼，小便濇淋，其形大而且硬。如气化者，毒在皮肤，未经入里，宜服万灵丹，洗浴发汗，解散皮肤之毒。精化者，毒在骨髓，未透肌肤，宜服九龙丹，通利大小二便，以泻骨中之毒。甚者二服皆可。行散之后，体实者升麻解毒汤，体弱者归灵内托散。服至筋骨不疼，疮根淡白，内毒已解，方用点药。轻者半年，重者一载，始能得愈。如患者不遵此法，欲其速愈，妄用熏条擦药哈吸等法，往往致成后患者多矣。　　看法<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>　　初起，无头痛，筋骨不作痛，小水无濇淋，疮干细者，轻。已生，头面稀少，口角无疮，项下胸背虽多，谷道尚无者，可治。初生，疮发下疳，次生鱼口，复作筋骨疼痛，疮发非祥；疮生红紫坚硬，手足多生，形如汤泼泡生，害非轻浅。　　治法<br>　　初起先从濇淋，次传筋骨作疼，后发其疮，亦宜攻利。若外无疳疮，内无筋骨作痛，时气所感者，微散之。疮从交媾不洁，乃生下疳，小水濇滞不通，当行导利。上部作痒，疮多，消风清热；下部作疼痒甚，泻湿为先。红紫盛疮高，凉血解毒，淡白毒轻疮薄，攻捕兼行。手足皮肤枯槁，鹅掌风，生柏叶、二矾煎汤熏洗即好。头发眉毛脱，油风何须说，神应养真丹，早服稀疏脱。点点杨花癣，片片癞风疮，宜服换肌丸，效应如同扫。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　　　景岳全书 【明　张介宾】</p>
<p>　　　　　天泡</p>
<p>　　天泡疮，形如水泡，皮薄而泽，或生头面，或生遍身，乃太阴阳明风热所致，故见于皮毛肌肉之间，宜清血凉血，热解则愈。如兼表邪而发热脉数者，宜荆防败毒散。如火盛者，或加芩、连、连翘、金银花、元参之属。如焮肿疼痛脉数便结者，此表里俱实也，宜防风通圣散双解之。如外多毒水，以金黄散敷之，无有不愈。<br>　　　　　杨梅</p>
<p>　　杨梅疮一证，以其肿突红烂，状如杨梅，故尔名之。其在西北人，则名为天泡疮，东南人又谓之广东疮。凡毒轻而小者，状类茱萸，故名茱萸疮。毒甚而大者，泛烂可畏，形如绵花，故名绵花疮。大都此证必由淫毒传染而生，盖此淫秽之毒，由精泄之后，气从精道，乘虚直透命门，以灌冲脉，所以外而皮毛，内而骨髓，凡冲脉所到之处，则无处不到，此其为害最深最恶。设初起时去毒不净，或治失其宜，而随至败烂陨命者，盖不少矣。<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>或至二三十年之后，犹然发为疯毒，或致烂头，或致烂鼻，或四肢幽隐之处臭烂不可收拾，或遗毒儿女致患终身，其恶如此！静而思之，则有见此恶道，而不为寒心知避者，其愚亦甚矣。故凡治之之法，最当知切要，不可不慎也。亦有不因淫毒传染，偶中湿热而患者，此不过在皮毛肌肉之间，清去湿热，自当全愈，无足虑也。　　今人每遭此毒，或畏人知，或畏毒甚，而大用攻击峻利等药，多致邪毒未除，而元气先败，或成痨瘵，或即殒命，或愈久愈甚，以致败坏不能收敛，皆元气先败之故也，余见之多矣。故凡被此病者，切不可惊慌，亦不可专肆攻击，但按法渐解其毒，务使元气毫无损伤，则正能胜邪，虽毒无害。若正不胜邪，则微毒亦能杀人。此其要也，不可不察。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　广疮治法：凡其初起而元阳未伤，毒亦未甚，宜速用清利，使从小便利去其毒，惟换肌消毒散为第一；其次则五加皮饮亦妙。或兼火邪者，宜秘仙方余粮汤。或禀气多弱者，宜茯苓膏。凡此诸药，或十日，或半月，甚者一月，无不见效。　　凡生疮毒者，宜服槐花蕊至二三升，则毒从小便泄去，可免终身之患，真神方也。　　此疮初起时，多有先下疳，次便毒而后疮出，是为一套。若便毒势甚肿痛，热秘而元气素强者，即宜用会脓散或牡蛎散，先去其毒之大势，而后用前方诸药，亦要着也。　　此疮久而不愈，或元气素弱，或因克伐致虚，但见有正不胜邪之势，则当酌其轻重，或以纯补元气为主。凡脾肾阴阳气血，皆宜随证用方，但使气血得复，则虽毒无害。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>最忌见不真而执两端，则终归无益，亦是要着。　　饮食宜否，有谓宜忌口者，有谓不宜忌口者而任其发透，总之亦有其要。盖疮毒初染，毒本未甚，此时只宜清利，使毒渐消为善。若食发物，则愈发愈多而毒愈甚矣，此则宜忌之时也。若疮毒已久，元气已弱，脓汁既多，血气既耗，斯时也，非以药食滋补，则日见消败，何以收效？此则不宜忌者也。宜忌不宜忌，亦宜补不宜补之法耳。使不知辨，安能无误？　　疮生头面，或遍身不便处，欲其速愈，但用点药，则二三日可以脱落，亦神妙者也，但此惟治标之法耳。　　疮毒久畜，发为风毒，亦名杨梅痈漏，或蚀筋，或附骨，溃烂不收，最为恶候。近来治法，惟五宝丹为最效；及徐东皋杨梅痈漏方，或秘传水银膏，宜择用之。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>　　　　　结毒</p>
<p>　　结毒者，熏火收遏疮毒而沉于骨髓也。又有未经熏擦，见苗未久，服药不多，内毒未尽，便用点药收敛，郁遏毒气者，亦能致之。发则先从筋骨疼痛，日后渐渐肿起，发无空处，随便可生。发在关节中，则损筋伤骨，纵愈曲直不便；发于口鼻，则崩梁缺唇，虽痊破形更相。发于咽喉者，更变声音；发于手足者，妨于行走。苦楚一生，毒遗数代。情关一错，祸起百端。初起筋骨疼痛，服金蟾脱甲酒，发汗自愈。虚弱者芎归二朮汤，头疼欲破者天麻饼子，并吹鼻碧云散。年余流串筋骨不愈者，五宝散。虚弱者，溃烂疼痛不敛者，十全大补汤同土茯苓煎服。初起筋骨痛甚者，雷火针法。已溃腐烂者，解毒紫金膏，依法施治。年远毒盛者，元武丹兼外擦灵药。年代浅近者只在百日，自然可愈，毋得再熏，为祸害人也。治法俱照杨梅疮证。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>　　　　方</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Heavenly Bubble</strong></p>
<p>This sore can affect people of all ages and is caused by the noxious heat of hot summer, which penetrates the muscles. It begins as a single blister and gradually spreads, leading to the body rotting without respite, and can infect an entire family. This condition requires cleansing with water and must not be touched by foul air. Internally, take a clearing decoction to dispel dampness; externally, use a poison-scraping ointment mixed with clay.</p>
<p><strong>Yangmei</strong></p>
<p>Also known as Guangdong sore or mold sore, this is a buildup of toxins in the internal organs, particularly damp heat in the spleen. There are three causes for its occurrence: a man engaging with a woman who suffers from sores, thereby being exposed to her toxic vapors; or a person with weak constitution encountering someone with sores, allowing foul air to enter the intestines and stomach; or a person already afflicted with sores, using a public restroom, where the toxic air remains and unknowingly enters through the orifices, gradually penetrating the internal organs. It may start on the head, under the ribs, or near the anus, with variations seen in male and female manifestations: the male type is as large as a ginkgo nut, covered with fifty to a hundred scattered spots; the female type is as small as a bean, with connected patches, oozing pus, deeply debilitating. Infants suffering from this ailment carry the toxins from the parents&#39; wombs. Sweating medications, oral medications, and topical treatments are advisable. Avoid pill medications, as they may contain light powder that can ease recovery too easily, whereas this light powder, derived from mercury, can corrupt the intestines and bones, causing significant harm.</p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition known as &quot;flipping sore&quot; arises after ulcers rupture, caused by liver heat and dry blood generating wind. Sometimes the wound forms flesh like a fungus, varying in size; at other times, it appears like a snake&#39;s head, differing in length. The treatment should nourish the liver and replenish qi, applying a corydalis paste externally, allowing the flesh to recede. One must wait for the vital energy to gradually recover and the pus and toxins to diminish; otherwise, while it may initially recede, it could rupture again. If one mistakenly uses knives, needles, cautery, or heat, the heat can increase significantly, leading to uncontrollable bleeding and potentially resulting in symptoms like chills, fever, and vomiting. Therefore, it is imperative to greatly nourish the spleen and stomach.</p>
<p>For celestial blisters:</p>
<p>If the pulse is floating, with fever or stiffness, one should disperse the exterior pathogens. If the pulse is deep with fever and constipation, one should resolve the exterior and attack the interior. If there is fever with red, painful urination, one should dissipate heat and detoxify. This is associated with insufficient vital energy, as pathogens have taken advantage; it may also be infectious, affecting the liver and kidney channels, thus often appearing in the lower body. Some patients experience pain in the muscles and bones first, then fall ill, while others face illness before experiencing pain. Initially, the pulse is floating and rapid, indicating pathogens in the spleen and lung channels; one should first use Jingfang Baidu San to disperse. If the pulse is wiry and rapid, indicating pathogens in the liver and gallbladder channels, one should use Longdan Xiegan Tang to clear and resolve it. If the pulse is deep and rapid, indicating pathogens in the viscera, one should start with Neishuhuanglian Tang to regulate, followed by Huanku Xiaodu San as the primary treatment, ensuring no subsequent pain in the muscles and bones. If the sore is raised, red, and painful, it indicates a strong heat toxicity; if it pains slightly, the toxicity is lethal. If the sore is white and does not crust, it suggests deficiency of yang; if it is red and does not crust, it suggests deficiency of yin blood.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Itching, with a weak and floating pulse, indicates that the qi cannot nourish one another; scratching, with a floating and rapid pulse, indicates that the blood cannot nourish one another. Itching occurring between the buttocks or the neck suggests deficiency of the bladder yin. Itching between the genitalia or inner thighs indicates blood deficiency in the liver channel. Severe drooping and itching of the scrotum indicates damp-heat and yin deficiency in the liver channel. Frequent and scanty urination that is red suggests yin deficiency in the liver channel. Frequent and scanty urination that is white suggests deficiency of spleen and lung qi. Itching or reddening of the face indicates an external pathogen affecting the body. Itching between the eyebrows or hair loss indicates dryness of the liver and gallbladder blood. Reduced appetite and thinking about food, with thirst for soup, indicate deficiency of the stomach qi. Difficulty in digesting food and loose stools suggest deficiency of spleen qi. Diarrhea in the early morning or at night indicates deficiency of spleen and kidney. If treated improperly, it could lead to damage to the eyes, rotting of the jade stalk, or cramping of the limbs; in such cases, one may use the Nine Flavor Aloe Vera Pills to clear liver fire, the Six Flavor Pills to nourish kidney water, and the Quenching and Detoxifying Decoction to nourish blood and expel pathogens, which can be effective.

<p>For conditions dominated by dampness, it is advisable to first treat the dampness. For exterior excess, one should first resolve the exterior, and for interior excess, one should first disperse the interior. If both the exterior and interior are excess, one should resolve the exterior and address the interior simultaneously. If the exterior is deficient, one should tonify Qi; if the interior is deficient, one should tonify blood; if both the exterior and interior are deficient, then one should tonify both Qi and blood.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Tianpao</strong></p>
<p>Tianpao sores, similar to dan poison, arise from the relationship of the Heaven Phase and the Least Yang being deficient. Thus, they are named Tianpao. They occur as fiery heat accumulates between the skin and cannot be released outward, resulting in the heat transforming the blood, leading to the formation of sores that resemble bean sores, with red roots and white heads, or often red heads, appearing in various places. If the condition manifests from the interior to the exterior, especially in spring and summer, and if all three burners are hot, then one should take Tongsheng San. If it arises solely from the head, neck, and arms, then it signifies heat in the upper burner, and one should take Liangge San. If it arises from the waist down, then one should take Huanglian Jiedu and He Shiyu Decoction. If it appears in autumn and winter, one should use Shengma, Gekgen, and Xijiao, and may add one or two additional herbs such as Fan and Qin; topical applications like Portulaca, Isatis, red adzuki beans, and ramie root can also be used to detoxify and reduce swelling during the initial onset. Additionally, shells or tortoise shells, or Hydrocotyle, when calcined for retention, can absorb dampness and promote tissue regeneration, suitable for cases that have become chronic.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>Someone asked, &quot;What about the wide sores?&quot; I said: &quot;These are due to damp heat in the liver and kidney meridians, possibly from excessive lust, leading to kidney deficiency, which causes it to be contaminated by evil and filthy qi. Alternatively, it may stem from syphilis that harbors toxins, lingering and persisting, causing this condition. It is also known as &#39;turning flower sore,&#39; where the flesh protrudes outward, resembling a waxy color and resembling cotton flowers; therefore, it is also called &#39;cotton flower sore.&#39; This indicates an abundance of evil toxins. Minor cases are referred to as &#39;wide beans,&#39; or they may resemble red-root pus cavities, indicating milder toxins. </p>
<p>For those afflicted with this condition, it is advisable to first consume detoxifying substances to induce results, followed by taking formulas like Tong Sheng San, ensuring the use of earth Poria should be stopped for a while. Once the toxins have been eradicated, formulas like Ba Zhen Tang or Shi Quan Da Bu Tang can be taken to replenish qi and blood. Strict adherence to dietary restrictions is essential for full recovery. Avoiding sexual activity is critical; any violation will render the medication ineffective.**<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Consider the following cautions: First, avoid sour vinegar, as it can bind evil toxins, leading to widespread skin issues. Second, avoid white intestines, which can generate stagnant heat and cause persistent conditions. Third, avoid light powders and cold water, as they can lead to joint pain and form wind lumps, which may appear after one or two years or even several years, appearing hard with a pale flesh color, causing pain or itching, often forming around joints and areas where meridians converge, and if broken, can result in oozing pus, which is quite dreadful. In less severe cases, it can manifest as widespread skin issues, also known as &quot;thousand-layered ringworm,&quot; commonly appearing on the palms and soles, overlapping continuously. There is also residual toxicity, known as &quot;qi toxicity,&quot; causing fluctuating pain in the muscles and bones, as well as &quot;damp toxicity,&quot; resulting in intermittent muscle and joint aches. Treatment should be tailored based on severity. Begin with detoxifying and dispelling evil winds, then follow with restorative tonics. For severe sores or deep toxic accumulations, it is necessary to use fumigation therapies; afterward, take Tongsheng San to dispel fire toxins, followed by restorative tonics like Ba Zhen Tang. Those who are weak should avoid fumigation to prevent being overwhelmed by excessive heat.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p>&quot;Turning flowers&quot; refers to a condition where the head is large but the stem is small, the small ones resemble beans, and the large ones are like fungi. They are neither painful nor bitter. When wiped, they bleed fresh blood, and over time, they can make a person weak. Mix saliva with ice-cold powder and apply it generously on the front, then wrap it in soft oil paper. For finer roots, tightly bind them with cotton and paper. After ten days, the affliction will fall off naturally. Then, use pearl powder mixed in to help the wound close. There are also those with a root not small, resembling a turtle or chess piece, which are hard to bind. For these, apply medicine first, then seal with dough and soft paper in two layers.

<p>&quot;Sky blisters&quot; are caused by excessive heart fire with accompanying spleen dampness. There are different manifestations in the upper and lower body, influenced by slight changes in cold and hot weather.

For the lower body, where damp heat is more pronounced than wind heat, it is best to focus on dispersing dampness first. Applying external powder such as hu fen (calamine) or stone pearl powder can lead to self-healing.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Overview of Yangmei Sores</strong></p>
<p>Yangmei sores are named for their resemblance to the yangmei fruit, and also known as seasonal sores due to their occurrence in response to changing weather and invasion by pathogenic qi. They are also called cotton flower sores because they are persistent and difficult to eliminate. These terms stem from the transformation caused by damp heat and malignant fire, with cases of qi transformation being mild and those of essence transformation being severe. </p>
<p>Qi transformation affects the spleen and lungs, presenting primarily in the upper body with symptoms such as itching skin and no pain in the muscles and bones, characterized by small and dry sores. Essence transformation affects the liver and kidneys, exhibiting symptoms primarily in the lower body with significant pain in the muscles and bones, and frequent urination, characterized by large and hard sores. </p>
<p>For qi transformation, where the toxin resides in the skin without penetrating deeper, it is advisable to take universal elixirs, bathe to induce sweating, and disperse the skin toxins. For essence transformation, where the toxin is in the bone marrow but has not yet penetrated the skin, one should take the Nine Dragon Pill to promote urination and expel the toxins from the bones. In severe cases, both treatments can be applied. </p>
<p>After dispersing the toxins, if the patient is robust, they may take a detoxifying decoction; if weak, a nourishing internal dispersing powder should be used. Once the pain in the muscles and bones ceases and the sores fade to a pale color, confirming that the internal toxins have been resolved, one may proceed to apply topical medicines. Recovery can range from six months for mild cases to a year for severe cases. </p>
<p>Patients who do not adhere to this method, seeking rapid recovery through random applications of fumigants, rubbing medicines, or inhalation techniques, often end up complicating their condition greatly.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Initially, there is no headache, the muscles and bones do not ache, the urination is unobstructed, and the sores are small and dry; these are mild cases. If sores appear with few on the face and mouth, and the neck and back have numerous sores but the groin is clear, treatment is possible. If sores develop into inguinal chancres and subsequently cause pains in the muscles and bones, the sores are not favorable; if they appear red, purple, and hard, and there are many on the hands and feet, resembling blisters from boiling water, the condition is serious.</p>
<p>Treatment methods:<br>At the onset, begin with clearing the heat and dampness, next address the muscle and bone pain, and then treat the sores, employing a purging approach. If there are no external chancres and no internal muscle or bone pain caused by environmental factors, treat mildly. Sores arising from unclean sexual contact lead to chancres, and if urination is obstructed, guiding the flow is necessary. If there is itching in the upper parts with many sores, clear the wind and heat; if there is severe pain and itching in the lower parts, prioritize draining dampness. For severe high sores that are red and purple, cool the blood and detoxify; for lighter, thinner sores that are pale, treat them with both capture and attack. For dried skin on the hands and feet, resembling goosefoot, a decoction of white cedar leaves and two alum for fumigation and washing will suffice. If hair and eyebrows fall out due to oily wind, there’s no need for lengthy discussion; nourishing the true essence with an elixir is recommended for early treatment. For scattered superficial fungal infections and patches of rough skin, it is suitable to take muscle-replacement pills, which will yield results akin to sweeping clean.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p>Tian Pao sores resemble water blisters, thin and moist in appearance. They may occur on the head and face, or be widespread across the body. They are caused by the yin and yang wind-heat, hence they are found between the skin and muscle. It is advisable to clear the blood and cool it; when the heat resolves, healing will occur. If accompanied by exterior pathogenic factors and fever with a rapid pulse, it is advisable to use Jing Fang Bai Du San. If there is strong fire, one may add Qinqin, Lian, Lianqiao, Jin Yinhua, and Yuan Shen.

<p>Yang Mei sores are named for their swollen, protruding red and rotten appearance, resembling the yangmei fruit. In the northwest, they are called Tian Pao sores, while in the southeast, they are referred to as Guangdong sores. Typically, lighter and smaller toxins are like the fruit of the zhuyu plant, hence known as Zhuyu sores. When the toxin is severe and large, decaying fearfully and resembling cotton, they are called Mianhua sores. Generally, this condition arises from the transmission of excessive toxins. Such filthy toxins arise after seminal leakage, where the qi travels through the seminal pathway, penetrating directly through the life gate into the chong vessel, thus affecting both the surface and internal structures, from skin to bone marrow. Wherever the chong vessel reaches, hazards are profound and malevolent. If detoxification is insufficient from the onset, or treatment is inappropriate, it often leads to severe decay and loss of life, a situation that is not rare.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Perhaps after two or three decades, it still manifests as madness or poison, causing rotten heads, rotten noses, the extremities or hidden places to stink and decay beyond remedy, or inflicting lasting ailments on children, the severity of such harm is evident! Reflecting quietly, those who see this harmful path yet remain untroubled and do not strive to avoid it show great foolishness. Thus, in all methods of treatment, it is most essential to understand the critical points and exercise caution. There are also cases where the illness is not transmitted through lewdness but arises from damp heat, which is confined to the skin and muscles; eliminating the damp heat will lead to complete recovery, with no cause for concern.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when people encounter this poison, whether fearing exposure or the severity of the poison itself, they often resort to aggressive and harsh medications, which frequently result in the evil poison remaining while their vital energy deteriorates first, possibly leading to tuberculosis, immediate death, or worsening conditions that spiral out of control—this is all due to the prior decline of their vital energy, of which I have witnessed much. Therefore, anyone afflicted by this illness must not panic, nor should they attack aggressively; instead, they should gradually resolve the poison according to proper methods, ensuring that their vital energy is not harmed at all, which indeed allows them to overcome the evil. Even a mild poison can kill if one’s defenses are weak. This is the key point and should not be overlooked.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method for Treating Ulcers:</strong> When an ulcer first appears and the original Yang energy is not harmed, and the poison is not serious, it is advisable to quickly use clearing and purging methods to expel the poison through small disturbances. The top remedy for this is the &quot;Change Skin and Dissolve Poison Powder.&quot; Following that, the &quot;Five-Flower Bark Decoction&quot; is also effective. If there is a combination with fire pathogens, the &quot;Secret Immortal&#39;s Remaining Grain Decoction&quot; should be used. For those weak in constitution, &quot;Poria Paste&quot; is recommended. Any of these remedies may show effects within ten days, half a month, or even up to a month.</p>
<p>For those who develop poisonous ulcers, it is advisable to consume two to three liters of locust flower pistils, which will help expel the poison through urination, thus averting lifelong troubles—this is a genuine divine formula.</p>
<p>When an ulcer first appears, there is often an initial discharge of yin dampness, followed by toxin in the urine, and then the ulcer appears—this completes a cycle. If the toxin causes significant swelling and pain, resulting in heat retention but the original qi being strong, one should use &quot;Gathering Pus Powder&quot; or &quot;Oyster Shell Powder&quot; to first eliminate the force of the poison, followed by the previous remedies.</p>
<p>If the ulcer persists without healing, whether due to generally weak original qi or because of excessive depletion leading to deficiency, it is important to assess the situation correctly. If there is a clear imbalance with the righteous qi unable to withstand the evil, focus primarily on restoring the original qi. The remedies for the spleen and kidney&#39;s yin and yang, as well as the qi and blood, should all be used according to symptoms, ensuring that the qi and blood are restored; then even if the poison is present, it will not cause harm.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One must be wary of perceiving things that are not true and clinging to extremes, as this ultimately leads to no benefit; this is a crucial point. Regarding food and drink, some say certain foods should be avoided while others argue they should not be restricted; thus, one must discern the essentials. When a wound is newly infected, and the poison is not yet severe, it is best to use clearing and purging methods to gradually eliminate the poison. However, if one consumes food that aggravates the condition, the poison will only increase, making it a time for avoidance. If the wound infection has persisted for a long time, the vital energy is already weak, with pus accumulating and blood energy depleted. At this time, unless one uses nourishing medicines and foods, the conditions will worsen day by day; therefore, in this case, one should not avoid food. The principles of what to avoid and what not to avoid, as well as what to supplement and what not to supplement, are essential. Without the ability to discern, how can one avoid mistakes?</p>
<p>For wounds on the head or face, or in hard-to-treat areas across the body, to speed up healing, one might apply ointment; with this method, after two or three days, the scab may fall off, which seems miraculous, but this is merely a symptomatic treatment. </p>
<p>When a wound infection is long-standing, it can transform into a wind-induced toxin known as Yangmei boil or sore. It may erode muscles or attach to bones, leading to incessant decay, which is the worst outcome. Recently, the most effective treatment has been the Five Treasure Pill, along with Xu Donggao&#39;s formula for Yangmei boil or a secret mercury ointment, which should be chosen wisely for use.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Toxic Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>Toxic accumulation refers to the condition where the poison from wounds is confined by heat and penetrates into the bone marrow. Additionally, if one does not undergo proper fumigation and scraping, and notices the initial signs of the ailment without taking sufficient medication, the internal poison may not be fully expelled. If one then uses topical medicine to constrict and restrain the toxic qi, this too can lead to the same condition. </p>
<p>Initially, it manifests as pain in the muscles and bones, which gradually swells over time, with no area spared from the outbreak. If it occurs in the joints, it can damage tendons and bones, making movement difficult even if the body later heals. An outbreak around the mouth and nose may lead to facial deformities. If the throat is affected, it can alter the voice; if in the hands and feet, it hinders walking. The suffering is lifelong, and the toxic legacy may affect several generations. </p>
<p>A small error in judgment can lead to numerous calamities. At the onset, with significant pain in the muscles and bones, consuming a jade toad shell elixir may induce perspiration for self-healing. For those who are weak, a decoction of Chuanxiong and Atractylodes may be utilized, while those suffering intense headaches may benefit from Tianma cakes or inhaling Biyun powder. For conditions lasting over a year where muscle and bone pain persists, a Five-Treasure powder is recommended. </p>
<p>For the weak, if there is persistent ulceration and pain, a Decocted Ten Complements herbal formula combined with raw poria should be administered. For those experiencing intense initial pain in the muscles and bones, the Thunder Fire Needle method is appropriate. For ulcers that have already rotted, detoxifying Zijing ointment should be applied according to established treatment methods. </p>
<p>In cases where the condition has persisted for many years and the poison is severe, Yuanwu Dan along with topical therapeutic agents should be used. For more recent cases not exceeding a hundred days, they may naturally recover without further fumigation, for this would bring harm. Treatment methods should align with the principles for Yangmei sore symptoms.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

Combine these five ingredients with the ram meat and boil down to one large bowl. Consume on an empty stomach. The ram meat can be eaten freely, covered to induce sweating, and bathe in the morning. One dose will bring immediate effect.</p>
<p>For the surrounding medicine:<br>Combine 0.5 oz. each of clove, sandalwood, agarwood, and frankincense with 0.1 oz. of musk, 2 oz. of mulberry frost, and 3 oz. of red stone resin, and mix with alkaline water.</p>

<p>For the fumigation method to treat yangmei toxin that spreads to the limbs or forms large ulcers all over the body, this method of fumigation is extremely effective in alleviating the effects of light poison. Use 1 lb. of good Qiai leaves and crush them, then mix with 1 oz. each of Xionghuang and Huangdan, 4 oz. of pine resin, and 0.5 lb. of Cangzhu, using rice wash water for preparation. Grind the four ingredients into a powder and mix with the Qiai leaves evenly. Make a medicine tube 5 inches long out of yellow paper, burn one end to create smoke, and direct the smoke onto the ulcer. Once half of the tube has burned, remove it and apply mercury ointment; wash and fumigate again the next day. This treatment is effective after half a month; if the condition is severe, it may take twenty days for results.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

He disagreed, so internally he used medications to lower fire and externally applied corrosives. The flesh corroded but then began to grow back; as it grew larger, his vitality diminished, and he began to believe my words. Therefore, he took the Gardenia Liver Clearing Powder internally and applied the Euphorbia Ointment externally, resulting in recovery. </p>
<p>Another instance involved a patient with a dislike for Liang (fine rice) who became angry, leading to a lump forming under the ear.

<p>A woman, known for her temper, had a carbuncle on her arm, with exposed flesh about two inches long.

When I doubted his condition, he opened and exposed the affected area about six inches in length; the color was rocky red, and blood was fresh and flowed for over three months. His liver pulse was taut and full. I prescribed Da Bu Tang with added Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi for over fifty doses, gradually seeing improvements in his symptoms, and the bleeding halted three to four times. Afterward, due to anger, his appetite suddenly decreased, and blood gushed forth once more, indicating his liver could not consolidate and his spleen could not control.

He experienced cold and heat, dry mouth, cracked lips, dribbling urination, phlegm rising, and a diminished appetite. This indicated that the spleen and stomach were injured, causing weakness in the organs and excess fire. He took over twenty doses of Six Gentlemen Decoction, followed by a combination of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Shan Zhuang Yu, Shan Yao, Mai Men Dong, and Wu Wei Zi, which restored his stomach qi and alleviated the symptoms; however, his urination did not fully clear, and phlegm persisted, leading to the use of modified Eight Flavor Pill until he was cured.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar suffered from itching on his head and face; it appeared as bumps, patches, or weeping lesions.

<p>The &quot;Orthodox Text of Surgery&quot; states: A man suffered from Yangmei sores for more than two months and, after self-administering a cooling detoxifying agent without improvement, experienced pain in his muscles and bones, with an internal and external mix of cold. This caused the toxin to sink and become difficult to expel, necessitating the use of warming spices. He took Wan Ling Dan and boiled it with scallion wine, performing baths over it. Initially, he broke out in a cold sweat like rain, followed by hot sweats, which reduced the pain significantly. After taking Gui Ling Decoction for more than a month, the sores began to stabilize. He then used Bixie Decoction in conjunction with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and after more than two additional months, he was eventually healed.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

When she was exposed to the cold at night, she took four doses of a decoction to dispel toxins, which alleviated the cold, but the pain persisted. She then took a sweat-inducing remedy twice, which resulted in only small spots like beans appearing on her head, face, and back, indicating the severity of the toxin. To alleviate this, she took two doses of a remedy to unblock and promote urination. After adding other ingredients, including soapwort and honeysuckle, and taking more than ten doses, her sores gradually enlarged, with smaller ones resembling coins and larger ones like cups, exuding foul pus and causing unbearable pain when getting up or sitting down. Externally, she applied a powder to the wounds, but they remained swollen and infected. Internally, she took a modified remedy for over two months before the sores began to dry up; the lighter cases healed and fell off, while the more serious cases took another six months to recover fully.</p>

Using mercury and copper sulfate among other medicines, he applied them to his hands and feet. Within two weeks, the sore did indeed heal. However, soon after, he experienced bone pain, and no medicines seemed to help. Six months later, toxins emerged internally, causing severe infection, with pain so intense he could barely bear it; his legs were covered with sores, and there was not a single area without them.

He was treated with thunder-fire needles, applying them to one small and three large swollen areas. Seven days later, pus and necrosis developed. He took the Xian Yi Liang decoction internally, and after two months, his pain gradually subsided, and the swelling began to diminish. After another two months, the necrosis completely healed, and new flesh grew. He then took the Six Great Nourishing Decoction, and after three months, he had fully recovered.</p>

Blood is a limited resource; thus I feared it would be hard to save. I first used Si Wu Decoction combined with Huang Lian Detoxifying Decoction, and after six doses, his bleeding stopped. I then administered Ba Zhen Decoction with additional Mai Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Huang Bo, and Zhi Mu over ten or more doses, stabilizing his vital energy. Externally, I had him bathe the swollen area with Gan Cao Decoction and apply silver powder. After about a month of this treatment, his vital energy and blood gradually revived, red flesh began to grow, and his member regained over half of its size.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue&quot; states: I once treated a young man who, after a chance encounter with foul toxins, suddenly contracted a sore at the tip of his penis. It began to ulcerate, and treatments were ineffective. The infection spread from the mouth of the urethra into the urinary tract, gradually deepening until it reached the anus. The swelling and pain became like fish bones, and at night there would be a blockage of pus that could not be expelled. If I lubricated him to help release it, first pus would come out and then urine, but treatments failed to reach it, which was quite alarming.</p>
<p>I came across an old man in the mountains who applied a formula made from locust flower petals, and within ten days, the root of the problem began to heal. After half a month, it healed from the inside out, and by the time it retreated to the mouth of the urethra, he was completely cured. After the ulcer healed, there were some minor sores remaining, and I gave him a decoction made from the bark of the Wujia tree for over ten doses, and he was completely healed.</p>
<p>The person who applied the formula said: This recipe is excellent for treating sores caused by indulgence and hot toxins, all of which are expelled through urine, which is why it can treat these sores. However, anyone who takes this may be spared from future sores and toxins for life. Nonetheless, there is still a remarkable detoxifying effect that occurs at the onset of the sores. If one sees sudden red patches all over the body, which vanish after a few days, these are indications of the emergence of toxin-related sores. When the toxins are expelled, the sores may still be visible, which serves as proof. Initially, I did not believe this, but when this person&#39;s sores appeared while those red patches were indeed present all over his body and disappeared after two days, I came to understand the miraculous power of the medicine.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

There are three causes for its occurrence: a man engaging with a woman who suffers from sores, thereby being exposed to her toxic vapors; or a person with weak constitution encountering someone with sores, allowing foul air to enter the intestines and stomach; or a person already afflicted with sores, using a public restroom, where the toxic air remains and unknowingly enters through the orifices, gradually penetrating the internal organs.

Infants suffering from this ailment carry the toxins from the parents' wombs. Sweating medications, oral medications, and topical treatments are advisable. Avoid pill medications, as they may contain light powder that can ease recovery too easily, whereas this light powder, derived from mercury, can corrupt the intestines and bones, causing significant harm. **Xue's Medical Cases** **[Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji]** **Reversal Flower** **[For sores with fleshy growths protruding]**"},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"The condition known as \"flipping sore\" arises after ulcers rupture, caused by liver heat and dry blood generating wind.

One must wait for the vital energy to gradually recover and the pus and toxins to diminish; otherwise, while it may initially recede, it could rupture again. If one mistakenly uses knives, needles, cautery, or heat, the heat can increase significantly, leading to uncontrollable bleeding and potentially resulting in symptoms like chills, fever, and vomiting. Therefore, it is imperative to greatly nourish the spleen and stomach. For celestial blisters: If the pulse is floating, with fever or stiffness, one should disperse the exterior pathogens. If the pulse is deep with fever and constipation, one should resolve the exterior and attack the interior. If there is fever with red, painful urination, one should dissipate heat and detoxify. This is associated with insufficient vital energy, as pathogens have taken advantage; it may also be infectious, affecting the liver and kidney channels, thus often appearing in the lower body. Some patients experience pain in the muscles and bones first, then fall ill, while others face illness before experiencing pain. Initially, the pulse is floating and rapid, indicating pathogens in the spleen and lung channels; one should first use Jingfang Baidu San to disperse. If the pulse is wiry and rapid, indicating pathogens in the liver and gallbladder channels, one should use Longdan Xiegan Tang to clear and resolve it. If the pulse is deep and rapid, indicating pathogens in the viscera, one should start with Neishuhuanglian Tang to regulate, followed by Huanku Xiaodu San as the primary treatment, ensuring no subsequent pain in the muscles and bones. If the sore is raised, red, and painful, it indicates a strong heat toxicity; if it pains slightly, the toxicity is lethal. If the sore is white and does not crust, it suggests deficiency of yang; if it is red and does not crust, it suggests deficiency of yin blood."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"Itching, with a weak and floating pulse, indicates that the qi cannot nourish one another; scratching, with a floating and rapid pulse, indicates that the blood cannot nourish one another.

If the condition manifests from the interior to the exterior, especially in spring and summer, and if all three burners are hot, then one should take Tongsheng San.

Qi transformation affects the spleen and lungs, presenting primarily in the upper body with symptoms such as itching skin and no pain in the muscles and bones, characterized by small and dry sores. Essence transformation affects the liver and kidneys, exhibiting symptoms primarily in the lower body with significant pain in the muscles and bones, and frequent urination, characterized by large and hard sores. For qi transformation, where the toxin resides in the skin without penetrating deeper, it is advisable to take universal elixirs, bathe to induce sweating, and disperse the skin toxins. For essence transformation, where the toxin is in the bone marrow but has not yet penetrated the skin, one should take the Nine Dragon Pill to promote urination and expel the toxins from the bones.

Treatment methods: At the onset, begin with clearing the heat and dampness, next address the muscle and bone pain, and then treat the sores, employing a purging approach. If there are no external chancres and no internal muscle or bone pain caused by environmental factors, treat mildly.

He took over twenty doses of Six Gentlemen Decoction, followed by a combination of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Shan Zhuang Yu, Shan Yao, Mai Men Dong, and Wu Wei Zi, which restored his stomach qi and alleviated the symptoms; however, his urination did not fully clear, and phlegm persisted, leading to the use of modified Eight Flavor Pill until he was cured. A Confucian scholar suffered from itching on his head and face; it appeared as bumps, patches, or weeping lesions. The pulses of the spleen and lungs were rapid, indicating damage from wind pathogen. He first used Jing Fang Bai Du San with additions of Bi Xie and Gou Teng, and gradually improved with several doses. But due to dry mouth and internal heat, he applied Si Wu Decoction with additions of Shan Zhi, Gou Teng, Jin Yin Hua, and Gan Cao Jie for recovery. Later, he experienced full-body itching, internal heat, and dry mouth, for which he supplemented with Six Flavor Pill until he was healed. The \"Orthodox Text of Surgery\" states: A man suffered from Yangmei sores for more than two months and, after self-administering a cooling detoxifying agent without improvement, experienced pain in his muscles and bones, with an internal and external mix of cold. This caused the toxin to sink and become difficult to expel, necessitating the use of warming spices. He took Wan Ling Dan and boiled it with scallion wine, performing baths over it. Initially, he broke out in a cold sweat like rain, followed by hot sweats, which reduced the pain significantly. After taking Gui Ling Decoction for more than a month, the sores began to stabilize. He then used Bixie Decoction in conjunction with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and after more than two additional months, he was eventually healed."},{"anchor":"trans-43p","marker":"43p","type":"translation","text":"A woman suffered from a painful illness after her husband had a sore, which caused her muscles and bones to ache severely. When she was exposed to the cold at night, she took four doses of a decoction to dispel toxins, which alleviated the cold, but the pain persisted. She then took a sweat-inducing remedy twice, which resulted in only small spots like beans appearing on her head, face, and back, indicating the severity of the toxin. To alleviate this, she took two doses of a remedy to unblock and promote urination. After adding other ingredients, including soapwort and honeysuckle, and taking more than ten doses, her sores gradually enlarged, with smaller ones resembling coins and larger ones like cups, exuding foul pus and causing unbearable pain when getting up or sitting down. Externally, she applied a powder to the wounds, but they remained swollen and infected. Internally, she took a modified remedy for over two months before the sores began to dry up; the lighter cases healed and fell off, while the more serious cases took another six months to recover fully. A scholar had a sore from a type of fruit for over a month and sought a quick cure. I told him this illness was unlike others, and if he sought a rapid cure, he would certainly leave behind residual toxins. I declined to treat him. He sought another doctor who promised to cure him in half a month without any future problems, which made him very happy. Using mercury and copper sulfate among other medicines, he applied them to his hands and feet. Within two weeks, the sore did indeed heal. However, soon after, he experienced bone pain, and no medicines seemed to help. Six months later, toxins emerged internally, causing severe infection, with pain so intense he could barely bear it; his legs were covered with sores, and there was not a single area without them.

He was treated with thunder-fire needles, applying them to one small and three large swollen areas. Seven days later, pus and necrosis developed. He took the Xian Yi Liang decoction internally, and after two months, his pain gradually subsided, and the swelling began to diminish. After another two months, the necrosis completely healed, and new flesh grew. He then took the Six Great Nourishing Decoction, and after three months, he had fully recovered. Another man had toxic swelling in the penis for six months, with the condition already affecting seven or eight parts. He encountered a master practitioner who treated him with smoking medicine, but the swelling caused him to bleed incessantly, leaving him looking ghost-like. I said: the poison has already harmed the vital energy; adding more heat from smoke will make the blood go rogue, resulting in significant losses. Blood is a limited resource; thus I feared it would be hard to save. I first used Si Wu Decoction combined with Huang Lian Detoxifying Decoction, and after six doses, his bleeding stopped. I then administered Ba Zhen Decoction with additional Mai Dong, Wu Wei Zi, Huang Bo, and Zhi Mu over ten or more doses, stabilizing his vital energy. Externally, I had him bathe the swollen area with Gan Cao Decoction and apply silver powder. After about a month of this treatment, his vital energy and blood gradually revived, red flesh began to grow, and his member regained over half of its size.

The swelling and pain became like fish bones, and at night there would be a blockage of pus that could not be expelled. If I lubricated him to help release it, first pus would come out and then urine, but treatments failed to reach it, which was quite alarming. I came across an old man in the mountains who applied a formula made from locust flower petals, and within ten days, the root of the problem began to heal. After half a month, it healed from the inside out, and by the time it retreated to the mouth of the urethra, he was completely cured. After the ulcer healed, there were some minor sores remaining, and I gave him a decoction made from the bark of the Wujia tree for over ten doses, and he was completely healed. The person who applied the formula said: This recipe is excellent for treating sores caused by indulgence and hot toxins, all of which are expelled through urine, which is why it can treat these sores. However, anyone who takes this may be spared from future sores and toxins for life. Nonetheless, there is still a remarkable detoxifying effect that occurs at the onset of the sores. If one sees sudden red patches all over the body, which vanish after a few days, these are indications of the emergence of toxin-related sores. When the toxins are expelled, the sores may still be visible, which serves as proof.
