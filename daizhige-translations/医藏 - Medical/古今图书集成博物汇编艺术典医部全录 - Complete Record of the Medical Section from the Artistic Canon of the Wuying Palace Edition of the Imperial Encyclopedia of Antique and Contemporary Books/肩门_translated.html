      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p><strong>Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Volume 170: Shoulder Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the True Words of the Golden Cabinet</strong></p>
<p>The west wind arises in autumn, causing illness in the lungs, with the acupoint located in the shoulder and back.<br>[Note: &quot;Yú&quot; refers to the place where vital energy is injected.]<br>The autumn air leads to illness in the shoulder and back.<br>[Note: The autumn air descends and contracts, failing to regulate between the skin and flesh, therefore, the wind enters the &quot;Yú.&quot;]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Human Energy and Vitality</strong></p>
<p>At the inch pulse, if the middle hand strikes upwards, it is called shoulder and back pain. [Note: Striking upwards with the middle hand means it is superficial and it responds readily. This external yang pathogen does not ascend nor descend, thus it affects the area of the shoulder and back.]</p>
<p><strong>The Method of Internal Organ Energy According to Timing</strong></p>
<p>For the sick, there is pain in the chest, fullness in the flanks, pain below the flanks, pain between the chest, back, and scapula, and internal pain in both arms. [Note: The hand&#39;s lesser yin heart meridian starts in the heart, ascends to the throat, exits below the flanks, follows the inner arm and descends through the elbow, coursing along the inner back of the arm. The hand&#39;s lesser yang small intestine meridian ascends the upper arm, follows the inner arm, and exits the shoulder, winding around the scapula. These two channels&#39; energy is full, hence the presence of such pain. The fullness in the flanks indicates that the channel of the lesser yin is congested, causing pain below the flanks.] For lung ailments, there may be wheezing, coughing with reversed qi, shoulder and back pain, sweating, and pain in the buttocks, inner thighs, knees, hips, and feet. [Note: The lungs govern qi and their origin is in the kidneys. The kidneys are the source and the lungs are the endpoint; the energies of the mother and child channels connect. Therefore, the channel of the foot&#39;s lesser yin, which directly connects from the kidneys, penetrates the diaphragm, enters the lungs, follows the throat, and engages the base of the tongue, results in reversed qi during illness, causing wheezing and coughing. The lung shu point is on the shoulder and back; if the qi reverses upwards, it causes shoulder and back pain along with sweating, whereas if it reverses downwards, it leads to pain in the buttocks, inner thighs, knees, and feet.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>The condition of the kidney cough involves pain pulling at the shoulder and back when coughing, and in severe cases, there may be sputum. [Note: The kidney meridian penetrates the diaphragm and enters the lungs, thus coughing can cause pain in the lung shu area.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatise on Qi Points</h3>
<p><strong>Shoulder Opening Points</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Point 1: Shoulder Well Point (Jian Jing), located in the depression above the shoulder, belonging to the Gallbladder Meridian of the Foot Shaoyang.</li>
<li>Point 2: Shoulder Repository Point (Jian Zhen), located in the gap between the two bones below the scapula, in the depression behind the Shoulder Joint, belonging to the Small Intestine Meridian of the Hand Taiyang.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Treatise on Qi Reservoirs</h3>
<p>Qi emerges from the Hand Taiyang Meridian, with one point each at Shoulder Opening.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: This refers to the two points at the Bai Feng (Holding Wind) located behind the small shoulder joint on the upper shoulder, wherein one feels emptiness when raising the arm.</li>
</ul>
<p>With three inches below the Shoulder Opening, there are also one point each.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: This refers to Tian Zong (Celestial Gathering) located in the depression below the large bone behind the Bai Feng.</li>
</ul>
<p>Qi emerges from the Hand Yangming Meridian, with one point each at the meeting of the shoulder bones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: This refers to the two points at the Shoulder Joint (Jian Yu), located in the gaps on either side of the shoulder bone at its upper end, easily located while raising the arm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Qi emerges from the Hand Shaoyang Meridian, with one point at the Shoulder Repository, and one additional point each spaced three inches below it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: The two points at the Shoulder Repository belong to the Small Intestine Meridian of the Hand Taiyang, positioned in the gap between the two bones at the scapula, in the depression behind the Shoulder Joint. The three inches below refer to the points of Jian Liao (Shoulder Creek), Nao Hui (Elbow Meeting), and Xiao Luo (Dispersing Valley). Jian Liao is located above the pronouncing muscle at the shoulder blade, Nao Hui is positioned behind Jian Liao, beneath the large bone, in the depression above the scapula, while Xiao Luo is found on the outer side of the lower arm, aligned with the elbow below the armpit.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Discussion on the Changes of Qi</h3>
<p>In years when fire is excessive, heat prevails, and the lungs, representing metal, are affected by pathogens. The people suffer from internal heat, experiencing heat in the shoulders and back, and in severe cases, fullness in the sides, pain in the sides, and pain between the chest and shoulder blades. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In years of Wu Wu, excessive fire rules, and as fire triumphs over metal, the lungs (metal) are affected. The shoulders and back correspond to the &quot;yu&quot; (status) of the lungs. If the fire becomes overly vigorous, it injures the heart, and the inner chest, governed by the heart, experiences pain between the chest and shoulder blades. The back represents yang, and the heart is the sun among yang, hence the pain in the chest, back, and shoulder blades. The hand&#39;s lesser yin heart channel emerges below the ribs, descends along the inner arm to the elbow, and follows the inner back of the arm, leading to the fullness and pain in the sides.</p>
<p>When the metal is insufficient in a year, fire then prevails, causing the people to suffer from heavy sensations in their shoulders and back. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In years of Liu Yi, as the metal is deficient, the fire, which is subdued, prevails. The lung &quot;yu&quot; is located in the shoulders and back, so the people suffer from heavy sensations in these areas.</p>
<p>When metal is insufficient, its misfortune lies in the west, affecting the lungs, causing internal discomfort in the chest, sides, shoulders, and back, while externally affecting the skin and hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The internal area of the chest is part of the lung, while the sides correspond to the realms of Yunmen and Tianfu, from which the lung channels emerge. The shoulders and back are also associated with the lungs. The skin and hair correspond to the outward manifestation of the lung.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Spiritual Pivot:</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Symptoms of Organ Diseases Caused by Pathogenic Qi</strong></p>
<p>In cases of small intestine disease, there is pain in the lower abdomen, discomfort in the lumbar region radiating to the testicles, and heat in the shoulders. <em>Note: The small intestine is referred to as the red intestine, serving as a receptacle organ, and its qi connects with the bladder, hence the pain in the lumbar region radiating to the testicles. The hand’s yang ming channel starts at the tip of the little finger and travels up the arm to the shoulder, indicating this is an ailment of the yang channel.</em></p>
<p>In cases of bladder disease, there is heat in the shoulders. <em>Note: The shoulder is where the foot&#39;s yang channel travels.</em><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Meridian Text</strong></p>
<p>The Lung Hand Taiyin Meridian governs diseases arising from the lungs. If there is an excess of qi, there will be pain in the shoulders and back, with symptoms of wind and cold leading to sweating and windstroke, and frequent but insufficient urination. If there is a deficiency of qi, there will be cold pain in the shoulders and back, with shortness of breath and insufficient energy to breathe, and changes in urine color. [Note: The excess and deficiency of qi refer to the qi of Taiyin. The lung shu point is located in the shoulder and back; pain occurs at the shu due to the qi, known as qi injury pain. Changes in urine color indicate that qi is deficient and unable to transform.]</p>
<p>The Large Intestine Hand Yangming Meridian begins at the tip of the index finger, follows along the outer aspect of the arm, and emerges in front of the acromion. It causes pain in the front of the shoulder and upper arm. [Note: The acromion is between the two bones at the tip of the shoulder.]</p>
<p>The Small Intestine Hand Taiyang Meridian begins at the tip of the little finger, emerges from the shoulder and encircles the scapula, crossing over the shoulder above. When in motion, it can cause throat pain, as if the shoulder is being pulled and the upper arm feels broken. [Note: The sides of the spine are referred to as the lumbar region, with the two corners above being the shoulder joint; the area below forms the scapula.]</p>
<p>The Bladder Foot Taiyang Meridian runs straight along the inside of the shoulder, flanking the spine and reaching the waist; its branch extends from the inside of the shoulder on both sides, penetrating downwards to the scapula.</p>
<p>The Sanjiao Hand Shaoyang Meridian begins at the tip of the little finger and travels up through the elbow, along the outer arm to the shoulder, and intersects behind the Foot Shaoyang Meridian.</p>
<p>The Gallbladder Foot Shaoyang Meridian travels along the neck in front of the Hand Shaoyang Meridian, reaching the shoulder and then intersecting with the Hand Shaoyang Meridian behind.</p>
<p>The Branch of the Hand Taiyang Meridian runs along the elbow and connects with the shoulder acromion.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>The trajectory of the Hand Yangming meridian runs along the arm and passes through the shoulder joint.</p>
<p>In the Meridian Branches chapter:</p>
<p>The course of the Hand Taiyang meridian leads to the ground, aligning with the point at the shoulder.<br>(Note: &quot;Aligning with the ground&quot; means that the Hand Taiyang point corresponds to the Foot Taiyang point.) The course of the Hand Yangming meridian travels alongside the chest and breast, branching at the shoulder joint.</p>
<p>In the Muscles chapter:</p>
<p>The muscle of the Foot Taiyang runs upwards, encompassing the spine and neck; its branch is connected at the shoulder joint. If there is a condition, it causes the spine to bend backward and the shoulder cannot rise. The muscle of the Hand Taiyang wraps around the shoulder blade; if affected, it causes pain that radiates to the neck. The muscle of the Hand Yangming wraps around the shoulder blade and encompasses the spine; the straight part runs from the shoulder joint up to the neck. If affected, the shoulder cannot rise. The muscle of the Hand Taiyin extends downward, emerges from the axilla, and connects in front of the shoulder joint.</p>
<p>In the Bone Measurement chapter:</p>
<p>The distance from the shoulder to the elbow is one foot and seven inches.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Five Evils Chapter</strong></p>
<p>If the evil resides in the kidneys, it causes pain in the shoulders, back, and neck.</p>
<p><strong>Master&#39;s Transmission Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The five organs and six viscera: the lungs are covered by the thorax; prominent shoulders depress the throat, revealing their condition externally.</p>
<p><strong>Original Organ Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Small white veins indicate small lungs, while coarse veins indicate large lungs. Prominent shoulders and a depressed throat correspond to high lungs, while armpits that widen and ribs that expand correspond to low lungs. Thick shoulders and back indicate strong lungs; thin shoulders and back indicate fragile lungs. A thick back shows upright lungs, while sparse ribs indicate tilted lungs.</p>
<p><strong>Jade Tablets Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Discomfort in the shoulders and neck indicates rebellion.</p>
<p><strong>Yin-Yang Twenty-Five People Chapter</strong></p>
<p>People with a wood constitution have broad shoulders and backs; fire constitution individuals have full shoulder and back muscles; earth constitution individuals have beautiful shoulders and backs; metal constitution individuals have narrow shoulders and backs; water constitution individuals have small shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Guests Chapter</strong></p>
<p>The earth has high mountains, and people have shoulders and knees.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Illness and Diagnosis Chapter</strong></p>
<p>Heat in the area behind the elbow indicates heat in the shoulders and back.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p>
<h3>Nine Palaces and Eight Winds</h3>
<p>The wind comes from the north, known as the Great Rigid Wind. Its harmful effects are stored within the kidneys and manifest externally in the bones and the muscles of the shoulders and back.<br>— &quot;Zhong Zang Jing&quot; by Hua Tuo (Han Dynasty)</p>
<h3>Shoulder Pain</h3>
<p>When there is heart disease, there is pain in the chest, swelling in the limbs, and pain in the shoulders, back, and arms. If the lung meridian is deficient, breathing becomes difficult, the ears feel heavy, the throat is dry, and there is coughing and gasping, accompanied by shoulder and back pain.<br>— &quot;Chuang Yang Quanshu&quot; by Dou Hanqing (Jin Dynasty)</p>
<h3>Shoulder Carbuncle</h3>
<p>Those suffering from shoulder carbuncles often develop this condition due to straining the shoulder point while carrying heavy loads. Use Neituo San, adding Wu Yao, Qing Pi, and Mu Xiang, and apply Jin Si Gao externally. Shoulder carbuncles are linked to the kidneys and bladder, where qi and blood stagnate, causing the development of toxic carbuncles. First, use Liu Qi Yin and Neituo San, and apply surrounding medicinals. Regularly take Disinfectant Powder and Neituo Ding Tong San. This toxicity arises from angry qi attacking the heart, alcohol, and sexual activity damaging the kidneys; thus, it is advisable to take Jiawei Tuo Li San. When the pus has drained, take Neibu San for three to four doses. If pus remains, use P排脓内托散. For dark, painful urination, take Wuling San with Huanglian and Dengxin to expel the toxins in urine. Continue with Ruxiang Huxin San at five doses daily; also, take Huangfan Wan at three doses daily.<br>— &quot;Upper Shoulder Carbuncle and Lower Mouse Carbuncle&quot;<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>This toxin arises from anger attacking the heart, and from sexual activity after drinking, impacting the kidneys. It is advisable to take a modified Tori powder; if there is fullness and depression in the chest, add tangerine peel and cardamom; if there is excess heat, add Xiao Chai Hu, Huang Qin, and Yuan Shen; for coughing, add Mai Dong, Bellflower, Wu Wei, apricot kernels, and mulberry bark; for dry mouth and irritability, add Mai Dong, Qian Hu, dried kudzu, and black plum; if there is excessive cold, add Hou Po, Fang Feng, and Huo Xiang. Also, take Huang Fan pills and Tong Qi powder, and apply Yuan Wu plaster and Jin Si plaster. If pus has been completely expelled, take three to four doses of internal nourishing powder; if pus has not yet been expelled, take the pus-discharging internal Tuo powder. For red and painful urination, use Wu Ling powder combined with Huang Lian and Light Heart; this toxin is expelled through urination. Additionally, take Ru Xiang heart-protecting powder, five doses daily; and also take Huang Fan pills, three doses daily.</p>
<p>Regarding the condition of Shaoyang meridian with a deficiency of blood and the presence of relative fire, especially pronounced in the Jueyin. If it arises over the left shoulder blade, it can be difficult to treat; if it is on the right shoulder, it is even harder to manage. This condition comes from the changes of wind, indicated by a broken pulse. The pathogen is in the exterior; symptoms of urination and defecation remain normal, diet is as usual, and the mouth can discern flavor, knowing it is not internal. Not sensitive to wind, only to dryness and heat; the pulse is not floating, indicating it is not on the exterior. If both interior and exterior are harmonious, the pathogen is within the meridians, congealed therein, leading to abscess formation. If the body is affected above the waist, it symbolizes the change of the eight winds. The method should be to repel cold pathogens and regulate the qi and blood within the meridians, thus restoring smooth circulation and self-healing.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Left and Right Chains</strong></p>
<p>This condition manifests on the left shoulder blade, occurring in a movable area, and can be treated for unease; if it occurs on the right shoulder, it is indeed difficult to treat. One can use dried chicken yellow skin and cotton fluff ground into powder; if moist, mix with dry, and if dry, use clear oil for application. If the condition occurs on the right shoulder blade, also in a movable area, it can be treated for unease; if it chains to the left shoulder, it is likewise difficult to treat. Use the same medicinal applications as before for the left shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>Abscess Development</strong></p>
<p>Whenever abscesses develop on both sides below the shoulders, due to blood deficiency and qi deficiency, one must not take tonic herbs that supplement yang. Heating agents are, in fact, yang supplements. If one receives heating agents, the deficiency heat will worsen, easily damaging the periosteum, thus caution is crucial. It is advisable to take the Sixteen-Herb Qi-Smoothing Decoction and Internal Huanglian Decoction, with treatment methods similar to those for back abscesses. For decoctions, avoid using aconite, cinnamon twig, and other similar ingredients.<br>— <em>From the &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan,&quot; by Li Gao during the Yuan Dynasty</em><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<h3>Shoulder Pain</h3>
<p>The pulse shows signs of wind-cold; sweating occurs, and there is pain in the shoulder and back. If there is a stroke, frequent and insufficient urination indicates that wind-heat has invaded the lungs, severely obstructing lung qi. One should resolve wind-heat to alleviate stagnation; Fang Feng Decoction is the main treatment. If the pain in the shoulder and back does not allow for turning, it indicates stagnation of the taiyang qi, which should be dispersed with wind remedies.<br><strong>Key Points of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</p>
<h3>Pain</h3>
<p>For shoulder and back pain, if the diagnosis is unclear, it is advisable to use Harmonizing Qi Drink, adding half a money of Wu Yao with each dose. If there is a cold, aching pain in the shoulder and back, and there is back pain, the ancient formula Shen Bao Pills has been effective; this is due to accumulated qi. If the person has a history of phlegm and fluid retention causing shoulder and back pain, Star Fragrance Powder or Phlegm-Resolving Decoction should be used, along with five sets of pills, paying attention to selecting remedies from the vomiting section. If there is kidney qi not following its proper path, with qi reversing and pressing up against the back, resulting in shoulder and back pain, Harmonizing Qi Drink should be used, again adding half a money of roasted cumin and ten roasted Sichuan peppers. If there is a deficiency of the fundamental body or pain after illness in the heart-lung space, or if there is pulling pain in the breast or wandering pain in the shoulder and back, this indicates a reversal of original qi. One should guide the qi back to its source and should not use further downward dispersing herbs, as it will worsen the pain; excessive sweating is common among people with this condition. It is essential to warm and tonify, adhering to the principle that one cannot resolve issues of stagnation with tonics. The classics state: &quot;Sweat is the fluid of the heart.&quot; It is also said: &quot;Yang receives qi from the chest; excessive sweating depletes the heart&#39;s fluids.&quot; Insufficient yang qi leads to pain.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p>
<h3>Medical Outline</h3>
<p><strong>Pain Associated with Lung Fire</strong></p>
<p>Shoulder and back pain belongs to lung-related illnesses. The classics state: &quot;The west wind arises in autumn, with the illness in the lungs, and the acupoints on the shoulder and back.&quot; Thus, the autumn climate causes illness in the shoulder and back. It is also said: &quot;Excess autumn pulse leads to illness, causing rebellious qi and pain in the shoulder and back.&quot; </p>
<p>Shoulder and back pain resulting from meteorological causes is related to the lung being attacked by fire. The classics mention: &quot;When the year&#39;s fire is excessive, the people suffer from heat in the shoulders and back.&quot; It is also stated: &quot;The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when heat is winning, it causes pain in the shoulders and upper back.&quot; Moreover, &quot;When the year&#39;s metal is inadequate, the illness resides within the chest, affecting the shoulder and back externally in the skin; treatment should be with cold medicine.&quot;<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Shoulder Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Ding Abscess: It occurs on both shoulders, with blood stasis, obstructing internal and external channels, leading to the formation of a Ding abscess. It swells in five days, causing the person to be mute and shiver with chills. It can be pricked on the twelfth day. If untreated, death occurs on the twentieth day. Chen Dry Abscess: The swelling arises on both shoulders and both large arm scapulae, causing relentless pain for twenty days, and is also immovable. Fifty days later, the body heats without redness. It can be pricked on the sixtieth day; if pricked and there is no blood, the patient will die. </p>
<p>Shi Rong Abscess: Swelling arises on the ribs and both shoulder elbows, leading to death if no holes are made in twenty days. It can be pricked on the ninth day. If it appears red and white interspersed, with a lot of pus, it can be treated; if completely devoid of red and white, it cannot be treated. </p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Li Chan]</p>
<p><strong>Left and Right Shoulder Affliction</strong></p>
<p>When occurring under the shoulders on the back, it is due to food poisoning, measuring about one foot wide and one inch deep. Even if it ulcerates dangerously, it does not penetrate the membrane and does not cause death. It requires urgent treatment to expel the toxins from the spleen and stomach. Internally, take Huxin Powder; externally, apply medicinal poultices to prevent heart distress. Medication is essential to halt its progression. If the entire spine is swollen, it is incurable. If the right shoulder develops on the bone, it can be treated if movable; if it connects to the left shoulder, it is difficult to treat. If the left shoulder develops on the bone, it can also be treated if movable; if it connects to the right shoulder, it is difficult to treat. For both conditions, take Tuo Li Powder internally, adding Sheng Ma and Jie Geng; externally, use Jahuo Powder or burn cotton to ash and mix it in, applying with sesame oil for dry areas.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Criteria for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Wang Kentang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Shoulder and Back Pain</strong>  </p>
<p>If there is shoulder and back pain due to wind-cold with sweating and frequent urination, the &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; already mentions using herbs that clear wind-heat and relieve lung obstruction. In this case, if there is insufficient cold and heat energy, resulting in shoulder and back pain and loss of urination, one should use ginseng and astragalus to replenish the deficiency in lung energy, which is self-evident.<br>If damp-heat is intermingled, resulting in heavy and painful shoulders and back, one should use the &quot;Angelica Pain Relief Decoction.&quot;  </p>
<p><strong>Shoulder Abscess</strong>  </p>
<p>If asked about how to treat an abscess on the shoulder, I would say: This is a point where the three yang channels of the hand and foot converge, known as shoulder abscess, resulting from wind-heat stagnation or injuries from carrying heavy loads. One should take Wujin Powder, Shengjin Dan, and Lifesaving Decoction with added Chaihu and JieGeng. For robust individuals, administer one pill of Jin Dan; for the elderly and weak, use the &quot;Ten Complete Ginseng Decoction.&quot;  </p>
<p><strong>Lotus Seed Fever</strong>  </p>
<p>If asked about internal pain in the scapula that gradually develops into an ulcer, I would say: This is known as Taiyin abscess, or lotus seed fever, caused by accumulated heat in the hand Taiyin lung meridian. It is suitable to use Lifesaving Decoction with added JieGeng and Astragalus, along with the Death-Denying Pill, Shengjin Dan, and select Astragalus and Mu Xiang Powder. For healthy individuals, administer Bazhen San and one Jin Dan. Red lesions can be treated, while blue-black ones cannot. If there is wheezing, severe thirst, chest fullness, and weak pulse, it indicates death.  </p>
<p><strong>Left and Right Communication</strong><a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Someone asked about the conditions for treating the left and right shoulder connections. It was answered: if there is an abscess on the left shoulder blade, it can be treated by connecting to the right; however, if there is an abscess on the right shoulder blade, treatment is more difficult when connecting to the left. There is an ancient saying about this, but I believe otherwise. When there is an imbalance of qi and blood affecting both sides, with the interaction of yin and yang, it is preferable to use Jin Dan (golden elixir) or Huomming Decoction with Qiang Huo and Ju Qing. For robust individuals, administer Ba Zhen San or a single Jin Dan. If the seven evil symptoms are few, what worries should there be about difficult healing? With depleted vitality, what can be done for supplementing treatment?</p>
<p>Regarding the abscess in the missing basin area:</p>
<p>Someone inquired about a sixty-year-old man with an abscess developing in the middle of his shoulder, experiencing severe chills and fever, poor appetite, tension in the shoulder and back, difficulty with urination, and abdominal distension. It was said: This condition is known as the missing basin abscess, also referred to as clavicular abscess, belonging to the Stomach channel of the Yangming foot and the Sanjiao channel of the Shaoyang hand. It is advisable to perform garlic moxibustion and to first take Zijindan (purple gold elixir) or Duoming Dan (death-defying elixir) to alleviate the severe symptoms. As he experiences difficulty with urination, administer Liu Yi San for relief; afterward, take Shi Quan Da Bu Tang (all-encompassing great supplement soup) for stabilization. If treatment is delayed even a little, it will certainly lead to ulceration. This condition generally has minor blood but abundant qi, with the wound edges not closing, and it can be critical and serious.</p>
<p>Regarding the abscess on the back of the shoulder:</p>
<p>Someone asked about an abscess on the bone at the back of the shoulder. It was stated: This is known as upper mouse abscess, or upper connection. It results from accumulated anger and belongs to both the Taiyang and Shaoyang channels. Initially, perform garlic moxibustion, and use Huomming Decoction with Qiang Huo, Ju Qing, and Chai Hu, alongside Jin Dan and choices of Zijindan and Duoming Dan. Once it ulcerates, administer Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, Huang Qi Mu Xiang San, and Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Method</strong></p>

<p>According to the &quot;Medical Guidelines,&quot; there are two methods for needling and moxibustion for shoulder and back pain. The first method focuses on the lung. The text states that when lung issues are present, symptoms include wheezing, coughing, reversed qi, shoulder and back pain, and sweating. This should be treated using the pathways of the Taiyin and the Yangming Meridians. It also mentions that excess lung qi can lead to cold pain in the shoulder and back, while deficiency of qi may yield insufficient breath. Treatment should take into account whether there is an excess or deficiency of heat or cold.</p>
<p>The second method focuses on the kidney. The text indicates that if there is pathogenic influence in the kidneys, it may cause pain in the shoulder, back, and neck, as well as occasional dizziness. Treatment points include Yong Quan and Kun Lun, and one should consider areas with abundant blood for treatment.</p>
<p>For shoulder and back pain radiating to the scapula, the point known as the scapula seam (胛缝) is located below the back aorta, aligned with the tip of the armpit and arm, and should be needled 2.5 cun deep with a technique of six releases and inhalations, while the point of Wu Shu should be needled 2.5 cun deep with eight releases and inhalations.</p>
<p>For pain specifically in the shoulder blade area, treatment points include Kun Lun, Xuan Zhong, and Jian Jing.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Shoulder, back, neck, and armpit pain, connected with the chest; take one part at Yongquan, and observe the blood—subtle. Needle one inch in front of the armpit. Another method: five parts at Qishe, moxibustion at Tianliao, one and a half inches at Quchi, and five parts at Tianjing. For shoulder and back pain, the point Shousanli is essential.</p>
<p>There are three methods for acupuncture and moxibustion for shoulder pain: the first is to use the Hand Yangming channel. The classic states: when a disease arises in the channel of the Large Intestine Hand Yangming, there is pain in the front shoulder and deltoid; assess the severity, heat, cold, and sinking condition to treat accordingly. The second is to use the Hand Taiyang channel. The classic states: when a disease arises in the channel of the Small Intestine Hand Taiyang, there is a sensation as if the shoulder is being pulled or the deltoid feels like it will break; assess the severity, heat, cold, and sinking condition to treat accordingly. The third is to address the tendons. The classic states: the tendon of the Hand Taiyin may cause pain around the shoulder and pull in the neck; symptoms include ringing in the ears and pain; conditions in the channels of Hand Yangming and Foot Taiyang also lead to shoulder immobility. All treatment involves burning needles or stabbing, determined by the number and location of pain.</p>
<p>Do not move the shoulder; do not lift the arm: two and a half inches at the shoulder&#39;s acromion, five parts at the greater tubercle. One inch at Qinglengyuan, and five parts at Guanchong.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Shoulder swelling: For the point at the shoulder (Yù) two and a half inches, reduce nine and then absorb; for the wrist bones, seven-tenths, first reduce and then supplement. Pain in both scapulae: Take the shoulder well (Jǐng) two and a half inches, do not stay long; needle the support groove (Zhī gōu).</p>
<p>Medical Case</p>
<p>&quot;The Confucian Family&#39;s Responsibilities&quot; states: When comforting a patient in the early stages of illness, there is pain in the right shoulder and arm without any control, inability to move, excessive sweating, and emaciated muscles, unable to lie flat—when lying down, the pain worsens. The classics say: Excessive sweating leads to emaciation. I ponder the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; which states: The void and the solid are adjacent; resolve and allow them to connect. It also says: Leaving emaciation unchanged, puncture at the joints to ensure the meridians are harmonized, and blood and qi will recover. It furthermore states: For those who have sunk down, apply moxibustion. For the yang qi sinking into the yin, there is occasional pain in the shoulder and unable to move. Direct fire to guide it upward, supplement and warm it. The above evidence all suggests acupuncture and moxibustion are suitable, specifically first to needle the well points of the twelve meridians. On April 12, at the shoulder well point, first needle, then apply moxibustion with twenty-seven cones, until the sore emerges, the emaciated area gradually adds muscle, sweating decreases, and the shoulder and arm regain some strength. On May 8, do moxibustion again at the shoulder well point, then at the cubital gorge (Chǐ zé) with each receiving twenty-eight cones, guiding the qi downward, connecting with the defensive qi. The next day the arm adds more strength and can move again. It was mid-summer, the heat gradually intensified, so I used Qing Fei Yin to supplement lung qi, nourish the spleen and stomach, and stabilize the mind&#39;s qi.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>The &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Case&quot; states: A man suffered from a toxic condition in his shoulder, marked by swelling, hardness, and pain, with severe symptoms recurring. Three qian of powdered alum were mixed into pills and taken with a decoction made from seven green onions; the swelling and pain subsided. After taking this again, all symptoms also retreated. Additionally, two doses of a legendary life-saving drink were given, and the condition resolved completely. This secret formula is called &quot;Thousand Gold Decoction to Transform Toxins,&quot; and is prepared with powdered alum and onion soup; because the powder is hard to take, it is made into pills. A certain practitioner treats sores and abscesses without regard to swelling or rupture by using this medicine for two or three doses first, then applying detoxifying medication, achieving excellent results. Those who frequently treat leeches find that using this alone leads to resolution, without necessitating expelling medications. This is because it only targets heat toxins and does not deplete blood and energy. If a person develops sores from metal or stone poisons, it is particularly effective, as alum also neutralizes these poisons. In another instance, five qian of powdered alum and five fen of cinnabar were taken with hot wine, which also proved effective. This medicine expels toxins, soothes the intestines, stops diarrhea, detoxifies, and drains pus without disturbing the internal organs or harming energy and blood—beneficial and without harm. The ingredients are easily obtainable, and its effects are significant, especially in remote areas where this knowledge should not be overlooked. In cases of bites from insects or dogs, applying hot melted ointment to the affected area and taking the powdered medicine mixed with hot wine also yields results.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>In the upper chamber of Chen Lixue&#39;s residence, it began with a slight chill beneath the left shoulder.

Then I administered the formula for relieving pain. The pain increased slightly alongside the redness. Next, I continuously gave doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, cinnamon, liquorrice, and rhizome, and after the pus drained, there was nausea and vomiting, incessant nasal congestion, coldness, shivering, profuse sweating, and a clear discharge from the top. This was a mistake in the administration of the cooling medicine; I quickly removed the wrapped medicine and gave a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, rehmannia, ginger, and aconite. The original chill beneath the left shoulder began to warm. I then administered another dose to reduce the swelling and warmth; the swelling was high and the pus was thick. Plus, I applied a chinese herbal ointment for several days, which expelled necrotic tissue in pieces the size of fat membranes. I continued the earlier medicine for two doses each day, increasing ginseng and astragalus to eight taels, finally stabilizing after more than two months. After recovery, whenever there was overexertion, I would prescribe ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, ginger, and aconite in large doses, and thus the patient would revive.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>A man suffered from painful shoulder caused by a toxic condition, experiencing agitation and constipation, with a rapid and strong pulse. After administering two doses of a cooling drink, he improved slightly; then, after taking four doses of honeysuckle powder, he completely recovered. Following that, using a decoction of Xie Xuan San with additional tianhua fen, the sore burst and healed. Both the pulse and symptoms indicated excess.</p>
<p>Another person had a carbuncle on the shoulder, with a rapid pulse. One dose of locust flower wine immediately reduced the symptoms; then, after applying more than ten patches with honeysuckle, astragalus, and licorice, the condition stabilized. The efficacy of locust flower wine in treating damp-heat is remarkable and quick. However, those with stomach cold should not take an excessive amount.</p>
<p>A woman had a lump that wouldn’t resolve, with clear pus that wouldn’t congeal. I gave her Ba Zhen Tang, which helped slightly; however, she suddenly experienced pain in her shoulder and back, making it difficult to turn her head. This was due to stagnation of the bladder meridian, and she should be treated with Feng Feng Tong Qi Tang. The bladder meridian starts from the inner corner of the eye, goes up to the top of the head, down to the corner of the ear, then back up to the crown and down to the back of the brain, passing through Feng Fu, down the neck to the shoulders, and extends down to the lower back. When this meridian is active, it causes back pain and a stiff neck, giving the sensation of being broken. What else could this be if not a bladder meridian issue? However, she claimed her lump was a problem with the gallbladder meridian, where the pulse indicates movement on the side of the neck, which occurs due to heat in the meridian. She then took herbs to clear the liver and reduce fire, leading to loss of appetite and exacerbated pain. When she asked me to diagnose again, the pulse indicated that her stomach qi was weaker. I started with Si Jun Zi Tang, adding dried tangerine peel, fried peony root, pinellia, notopterygium, and vitex for four doses, after which her appetite returned and the pain ceased; I then followed up with two doses of Feng Feng Tong Qi Tang, and she was cured.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Wang Qiao, over thirty years old, suffered from a toxic condition. He used a dose of Ginseng Detox Powder, then added ten Xuan San without ginseng and cassia, incorporating honeysuckle and flower powder in four doses, leading to an outbreak. In anger, his liver fire was stirred, and with wind-heat obstructing upward, his face and head became red and swollen, experiencing pain from drinking cold. He applied Jingfang Detox Powder, adding Scutellaria and Lianhua, but it did not respond. </p>
<p>In a hurry, he used a needle on the affected area, resulting in the expulsion of black blood about the size of a cup; still, one dose was administered, and much of the condition retreated. Afterward, he took four additional doses of Ginseng Detox Powder, achieving recovery. </p>
<p>Illness can vary in surface and internal conditions, and treatment can differ in urgency, invasion, supplementation, and support. If one does not use acupuncture or needling, the toxic qi can become trapped in the flesh, and medicine will not be effective, leading to an aggravation of heat and swelling. Using harsh, aggressive medications would mean that the exterior heat has not been addressed while the internal cold has already set in, which would undoubtedly be fatal.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>A man suffered from shoulder abscess, experiencing thirst and a rapid, strong pulse. After three doses of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, the symptoms relieved; then, he took four doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction, and the abscess burst and healed.</p>
<p>A woman had a poison under her shoulder, with a tense and wiry pulse. After two doses of Baizhi Shengma Decoction, her exterior symptoms subsided. Then, with a drug to resolve the swelling, she healed.</p>
<p>A man had a shoulder abscess for several days, with general swelling and slight pain. His head was swollen with many lumps, each about the size of millet, with unchanged color and no suppuration. This indicated deficiency of Qi and blood, which was confirmed upon pulse diagnosis. First, he took two doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction to mitigate the major issue; then, he used a drug to promote suppuration. Even though the abscess burst, only blood and fluid flowed, indicating that his Qi and blood were still deficient and could not form pus. He wished to take Taiyi Pill, but I advised that this medicine only targeted toxins and could not promote resolution. He did not fully believe me and continued taking it. After four doses, he could not eat, the abscess appeared black and sunken, and he experienced continuous belching, indicating extreme deficiency of stomach Qi. He did not improve. Desperate, I administered a warming, spleen-strengthening remedy, but he did not respond and died.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>In the winter of the Gui Mao year, a woman lost something and became angry. She experienced slight swelling in her lower abdomen, which grew large like an inverted bowl in the spring of the Jia Chen year. Her left scapula was also swollen, but its color remained normal. After some treatment, about three bowls of fresh blood were drawn with a needle; she had sharp abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, cold limbs, vomiting, and chills, at times accompanied by fever, and had refused food for seven days. Her pulse was strong and broad, intermittently faint, indicating a depletion of yang energy. </p>
<p>For treatment, six ingredients were applied, supplemented with three qian of roasted ginger and two qian of aconite. Taken from morning until noon, there was no response; after a second dose, aconite was increased by five qian. She fell into a deep sleep, and upon waking, many symptoms had significantly improved. She was given a little thin porridge. After four additional doses, all symptoms subsided, and her diet returned to normal, but abdominal pain resumed. Another needle was used to draw out about two bowls of clear pus, and her symptoms reappeared, indicating extreme deficiency.</p>
<p>Thus, a formula of ten complete tonics was combined with one qian each of ginger, cassia, and aconite; after three doses, she felt stable. Later, the amounts of ginger, cassia, and aconite were reduced by five fen each, and she took it along with Gui Pi Tang. After over fifty doses, she was cured.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Surgery&quot; states: A man aged sixty-two developed a right swelling. Initially, moxibustion was applied, but gradually the swelling became elevated, hard, and painless. After fifteen days, it had not yet ulcerated, and he experienced increasing agitation. Fearing the situation would worsen, I first used a needle to relieve it, followed by bloodletting, which drew out a considerable amount of foul blood. Afterward, there was some relief, and I applied an ointment to dissolve the necrosis, which was used for three days, after which the ulcer began to necrose. By the twentieth day, proper pus also emerged, the necrotic tissue gradually sloughed off, and new tissue began to grow. Other treatment methods were exhausted. The patient had a close relationship with a physician from internal medicine, relying on him for oral medication while neglecting the external surgical methods I recommended. He insisted on his own views and ignored my advice, leading to inadequate treatment, as he believed that two qian of ginseng daily was sufficient.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>I said it is not enough; the standard should be five qian, and with an additional two qian for thoroughness, it would be considered appropriate for treating disease. Otherwise, there will certainly be complications. They all did not believe me, and in the end, the flesh color turned pale white, the wound edges spread wide, the pus was clear and thin, and appetite decreased—these are evident signs of decline. Even though they forcefully took warming and spleen-tonifying medications, they ultimately did not respond. As for the body wasting away, with foul-smelling pus, extending to sixty days, draining all vital energy and blood leading to death, only then would they regret it. They did not realize that for large sores, if a bowl of pus comes out daily, ginseng must be at least three qian, and this is a rule. Moreover, in this condition where pus is produced, if three bowls of pus come out daily, using only two qian of ginseng is barely a small remedy compared to a significant loss—how could it not lead to death? External wounds are particularly prone to leaking vital energy. If loss and tonification do not conflict, there will be no way to balance them, often leading to situations where rescue is impossible. This illustrates disbelief in tonification, clinging to common views, and thus inviting demise; how unfortunate!<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　肩疽</p>
<p>　　病肩疽者，因负重伤动肩井穴，故生此疽。用内托散加乌药、青皮、木香，外贴金丝膏。　　肩疽受在肾膀胱，气血凝滞不行，结成疽毒也。先用流气饮、内托散，四围以围药敷之，多服消毒散、内托定痛散。　　此毒因怒气上攻于心，酒后房事，下伤于肾，宜服加味托里散。如脓出尽时，服内补散三四贴。脓未尽时，服排脓内托散。小便赤濇，用五苓散加黄连、灯心服之，其毒从小便出。更服乳香护心散，日进五服；又服黄矾丸，日进三服。<br>　　　　　上肩疽下鼠疽<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p>
<p>　　此毒因怒气上攻于心，酒后房事，下伤于肾，宜服加味托里散；胸膈满闷，加陈皮、砂仁；热盛，加小柴胡、黄芩、元参；咳嗽加麦冬、兜铃、五味、杏仁、桑皮；口干烦躁，加麦冬、前胡、干葛、乌梅；寒多，加厚朴、防风、藿香，再服黄矾丸、通气散，仍贴元武膏、金丝膏。如脓出尽时，服内补散三四贴；脓未尽时，服排脓内托散。小便赤濇，用五苓散加黄连、灯心服之，其毒从小便出。更服乳香护心散，日进五服；又服黄矾丸，日进三服。<br>　　　　　左右搭</p>
<p>　　此证少阳经少血有相火，尤甚于厥阴。发于左搭肩骨上，生移动之处，可治难安；串于右搭肩者，必难治也。此证由于风变之来，以脉断之。邪在表，其证大小便如故，饮食如常，口能知味，知其不在里也。不恶风，只燥热，脉不浮，知不在表。若表里既和，则邪在经络中，凝于经络，其痈斯出。身半以上，风从受之，故云八风之变。法当却寒邪，调和经络中气血，则气血通畅自愈。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　　　　左右串</p>

<p>　　凡两肩下两胁边成痈疽，因血虚而气亦虚，切不可服补阳之药。热剂，即补阳也。倘受热剂则虚热愈盛，易致伤骨膜，切慎切慎。宜服十六味流气饮、内疏黄连汤，治法与发背痈疽同。汤剂，附子、薄桂、乌头之类禁用。<br>　　　　东垣十书 【元　李杲】<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of Human Energy and Vitality</strong></p>
<p>At the inch pulse, if the middle hand strikes upwards, it is called shoulder and back pain. [Note: Striking upwards with the middle hand means it is superficial and it responds readily. This external yang pathogen does not ascend nor descend, thus it affects the area of the shoulder and back.]</p>
<p><strong>The Method of Internal Organ Energy According to Timing</strong></p>
<p>For the sick, there is pain in the chest, fullness in the flanks, pain below the flanks, pain between the chest, back, and scapula, and internal pain in both arms. [Note: The hand&#39;s lesser yin heart meridian starts in the heart, ascends to the throat, exits below the flanks, follows the inner arm and descends through the elbow, coursing along the inner back of the arm. The hand&#39;s lesser yang small intestine meridian ascends the upper arm, follows the inner arm, and exits the shoulder, winding around the scapula. These two channels&#39; energy is full, hence the presence of such pain. The fullness in the flanks indicates that the channel of the lesser yin is congested, causing pain below the flanks.] For lung ailments, there may be wheezing, coughing with reversed qi, shoulder and back pain, sweating, and pain in the buttocks, inner thighs, knees, hips, and feet. [Note: The lungs govern qi and their origin is in the kidneys. The kidneys are the source and the lungs are the endpoint; the energies of the mother and child channels connect. Therefore, the channel of the foot&#39;s lesser yin, which directly connects from the kidneys, penetrates the diaphragm, enters the lungs, follows the throat, and engages the base of the tongue, results in reversed qi during illness, causing wheezing and coughing. The lung shu point is on the shoulder and back; if the qi reverses upwards, it causes shoulder and back pain along with sweating, whereas if it reverses downwards, it leads to pain in the buttocks, inner thighs, knees, and feet.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Coughing</strong></p>
<p>The condition of the kidney cough involves pain pulling at the shoulder and back when coughing, and in severe cases, there may be sputum. [Note: The kidney meridian penetrates the diaphragm and enters the lungs, thus coughing can cause pain in the lung shu area.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<ul>
<li>Note: This refers to the two points at the Bai Feng (Holding Wind) located behind the small shoulder joint on the upper shoulder, wherein one feels emptiness when raising the arm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Qi emerges from the Hand Yangming Meridian, with one point each at the meeting of the shoulder bones.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note: This refers to the two points at the Shoulder Joint (Jian Yu), located in the gaps on either side of the shoulder bone at its upper end, easily located while raising the arm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Qi emerges from the Hand Shaoyang Meridian, with one point at the Shoulder Repository, and one additional point each spaced three inches below it.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on the Changes of Qi</h3>
<p>In years when fire is excessive, heat prevails, and the lungs, representing metal, are affected by pathogens. The people suffer from internal heat, experiencing heat in the shoulders and back, and in severe cases, fullness in the sides, pain in the sides, and pain between the chest and shoulder blades. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In years of Wu Wu, excessive fire rules, and as fire triumphs over metal, the lungs (metal) are affected. The shoulders and back correspond to the &quot;yu&quot; (status) of the lungs. If the fire becomes overly vigorous, it injures the heart, and the inner chest, governed by the heart, experiences pain between the chest and shoulder blades. The back represents yang, and the heart is the sun among yang, hence the pain in the chest, back, and shoulder blades. The hand&#39;s lesser yin heart channel emerges below the ribs, descends along the inner arm to the elbow, and follows the inner back of the arm, leading to the fullness and pain in the sides.</p>
<p>When the metal is insufficient in a year, fire then prevails, causing the people to suffer from heavy sensations in their shoulders and back. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In years of Liu Yi, as the metal is deficient, the fire, which is subdued, prevails. The lung &quot;yu&quot; is located in the shoulders and back, so the people suffer from heavy sensations in these areas.</p>
<p>When metal is insufficient, its misfortune lies in the west, affecting the lungs, causing internal discomfort in the chest, sides, shoulders, and back, while externally affecting the skin and hair.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The internal area of the chest is part of the lung, while the sides correspond to the realms of Yunmen and Tianfu, from which the lung channels emerge. The shoulders and back are also associated with the lungs. The skin and hair correspond to the outward manifestation of the lung.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Lung Hand Taiyin Meridian governs diseases arising from the lungs. If there is an excess of qi, there will be pain in the shoulders and back, with symptoms of wind and cold leading to sweating and windstroke, and frequent but insufficient urination. If there is a deficiency of qi, there will be cold pain in the shoulders and back, with shortness of breath and insufficient energy to breathe, and changes in urine color. [Note: The excess and deficiency of qi refer to the qi of Taiyin. The lung shu point is located in the shoulder and back; pain occurs at the shu due to the qi, known as qi injury pain. Changes in urine color indicate that qi is deficient and unable to transform.]</p>
<p>The Large Intestine Hand Yangming Meridian begins at the tip of the index finger, follows along the outer aspect of the arm, and emerges in front of the acromion. It causes pain in the front of the shoulder and upper arm. [Note: The acromion is between the two bones at the tip of the shoulder.]</p>
<p>The Small Intestine Hand Taiyang Meridian begins at the tip of the little finger, emerges from the shoulder and encircles the scapula, crossing over the shoulder above. When in motion, it can cause throat pain, as if the shoulder is being pulled and the upper arm feels broken. [Note: The sides of the spine are referred to as the lumbar region, with the two corners above being the shoulder joint; the area below forms the scapula.]</p>
<p>The Bladder Foot Taiyang Meridian runs straight along the inside of the shoulder, flanking the spine and reaching the waist; its branch extends from the inside of the shoulder on both sides, penetrating downwards to the scapula.</p>
<p>The Sanjiao Hand Shaoyang Meridian begins at the tip of the little finger and travels up through the elbow, along the outer arm to the shoulder, and intersects behind the Foot Shaoyang Meridian.</p>
<p>The Gallbladder Foot Shaoyang Meridian travels along the neck in front of the Hand Shaoyang Meridian, reaching the shoulder and then intersecting with the Hand Shaoyang Meridian behind.</p>

First, use Liu Qi Yin and Neituo San, and apply surrounding medicinals. Regularly take Disinfectant Powder and Neituo Ding Tong San. This toxicity arises from angry qi attacking the heart, alcohol, and sexual activity damaging the kidneys; thus, it is advisable to take Jiawei Tuo Li San. When the pus has drained, take Neibu San for three to four doses. If pus remains, use P排脓内托散. For dark, painful urination, take Wuling San with Huanglian and Dengxin to expel the toxins in urine.

<p>Regarding the condition of Shaoyang meridian with a deficiency of blood and the presence of relative fire, especially pronounced in the Jueyin. If it arises over the left shoulder blade, it can be difficult to treat; if it is on the right shoulder, it is even harder to manage. This condition comes from the changes of wind, indicated by a broken pulse. The pathogen is in the exterior; symptoms of urination and defecation remain normal, diet is as usual, and the mouth can discern flavor, knowing it is not internal. Not sensitive to wind, only to dryness and heat; the pulse is not floating, indicating it is not on the exterior. If both interior and exterior are harmonious, the pathogen is within the meridians, congealed therein, leading to abscess formation. If the body is affected above the waist, it symbolizes the change of the eight winds. The method should be to repel cold pathogens and regulate the qi and blood within the meridians, thus restoring smooth circulation and self-healing.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Shoulder Pain</h3>
<p>The pulse shows signs of wind-cold; sweating occurs, and there is pain in the shoulder and back. If there is a stroke, frequent and insufficient urination indicates that wind-heat has invaded the lungs, severely obstructing lung qi. One should resolve wind-heat to alleviate stagnation; Fang Feng Decoction is the main treatment. If the pain in the shoulder and back does not allow for turning, it indicates stagnation of the taiyang qi, which should be dispersed with wind remedies.<br><strong>Key Points of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Dai Sigong)</p>
<h3>Pain</h3>
<p>For shoulder and back pain, if the diagnosis is unclear, it is advisable to use Harmonizing Qi Drink, adding half a money of Wu Yao with each dose. If there is a cold, aching pain in the shoulder and back, and there is back pain, the ancient formula Shen Bao Pills has been effective; this is due to accumulated qi. If the person has a history of phlegm and fluid retention causing shoulder and back pain, Star Fragrance Powder or Phlegm-Resolving Decoction should be used, along with five sets of pills, paying attention to selecting remedies from the vomiting section. If there is kidney qi not following its proper path, with qi reversing and pressing up against the back, resulting in shoulder and back pain, Harmonizing Qi Drink should be used, again adding half a money of roasted cumin and ten roasted Sichuan peppers. If there is a deficiency of the fundamental body or pain after illness in the heart-lung space, or if there is pulling pain in the breast or wandering pain in the shoulder and back, this indicates a reversal of original qi. One should guide the qi back to its source and should not use further downward dispersing herbs, as it will worsen the pain; excessive sweating is common among people with this condition. It is essential to warm and tonify, adhering to the principle that one cannot resolve issues of stagnation with tonics. The classics state: &quot;Sweat is the fluid of the heart.&quot; It is also said: &quot;Yang receives qi from the chest; excessive sweating depletes the heart&#39;s fluids.&quot; Insufficient yang qi leads to pain.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Pain Associated with Lung Fire</strong></p>
<p>Shoulder and back pain belongs to lung-related illnesses. The classics state: &quot;The west wind arises in autumn, with the illness in the lungs, and the acupoints on the shoulder and back.&quot; Thus, the autumn climate causes illness in the shoulder and back. It is also said: &quot;Excess autumn pulse leads to illness, causing rebellious qi and pain in the shoulder and back.&quot; </p>
<p>Shoulder and back pain resulting from meteorological causes is related to the lung being attacked by fire. The classics mention: &quot;When the year&#39;s fire is excessive, the people suffer from heat in the shoulders and back.&quot; It is also stated: &quot;The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when heat is winning, it causes pain in the shoulders and upper back.&quot; Moreover, &quot;When the year&#39;s metal is inadequate, the illness resides within the chest, affecting the shoulder and back externally in the skin; treatment should be with cold medicine.&quot;<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Shoulder Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Ding Abscess: It occurs on both shoulders, with blood stasis, obstructing internal and external channels, leading to the formation of a Ding abscess. It swells in five days, causing the person to be mute and shiver with chills. It can be pricked on the twelfth day. If untreated, death occurs on the twentieth day. Chen Dry Abscess: The swelling arises on both shoulders and both large arm scapulae, causing relentless pain for twenty days, and is also immovable. Fifty days later, the body heats without redness. It can be pricked on the sixtieth day; if pricked and there is no blood, the patient will die. </p>
<p>Shi Rong Abscess: Swelling arises on the ribs and both shoulder elbows, leading to death if no holes are made in twenty days. It can be pricked on the ninth day. If it appears red and white interspersed, with a lot of pus, it can be treated; if completely devoid of red and white, it cannot be treated. </p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Li Chan]</p>
<p><strong>Left and Right Shoulder Affliction</strong></p>
<p>When occurring under the shoulders on the back, it is due to food poisoning, measuring about one foot wide and one inch deep. Even if it ulcerates dangerously, it does not penetrate the membrane and does not cause death. It requires urgent treatment to expel the toxins from the spleen and stomach. Internally, take Huxin Powder; externally, apply medicinal poultices to prevent heart distress. Medication is essential to halt its progression. If the entire spine is swollen, it is incurable. If the right shoulder develops on the bone, it can be treated if movable; if it connects to the left shoulder, it is difficult to treat. If the left shoulder develops on the bone, it can also be treated if movable; if it connects to the right shoulder, it is difficult to treat. For both conditions, take Tuo Li Powder internally, adding Sheng Ma and Jie Geng; externally, use Jahuo Powder or burn cotton to ash and mix it in, applying with sesame oil for dry areas.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Criteria for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Wang Kentang)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Shoulder and Back Pain</strong>  </p>
<p>If there is shoulder and back pain due to wind-cold with sweating and frequent urination, the &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; already mentions using herbs that clear wind-heat and relieve lung obstruction. In this case, if there is insufficient cold and heat energy, resulting in shoulder and back pain and loss of urination, one should use ginseng and astragalus to replenish the deficiency in lung energy, which is self-evident.<br>If damp-heat is intermingled, resulting in heavy and painful shoulders and back, one should use the &quot;Angelica Pain Relief Decoction.&quot;  </p>
<p><strong>Shoulder Abscess</strong>  </p>
<p>If asked about how to treat an abscess on the shoulder, I would say: This is a point where the three yang channels of the hand and foot converge, known as shoulder abscess, resulting from wind-heat stagnation or injuries from carrying heavy loads. One should take Wujin Powder, Shengjin Dan, and Lifesaving Decoction with added Chaihu and JieGeng. For robust individuals, administer one pill of Jin Dan; for the elderly and weak, use the &quot;Ten Complete Ginseng Decoction.&quot;  </p>
<p><strong>Lotus Seed Fever</strong>  </p>
<p>If asked about internal pain in the scapula that gradually develops into an ulcer, I would say: This is known as Taiyin abscess, or lotus seed fever, caused by accumulated heat in the hand Taiyin lung meridian. It is suitable to use Lifesaving Decoction with added JieGeng and Astragalus, along with the Death-Denying Pill, Shengjin Dan, and select Astragalus and Mu Xiang Powder. For healthy individuals, administer Bazhen San and one Jin Dan. Red lesions can be treated, while blue-black ones cannot. If there is wheezing, severe thirst, chest fullness, and weak pulse, it indicates death.  </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Someone asked about the conditions for treating the left and right shoulder connections. It was answered: if there is an abscess on the left shoulder blade, it can be treated by connecting to the right; however, if there is an abscess on the right shoulder blade, treatment is more difficult when connecting to the left. There is an ancient saying about this, but I believe otherwise. When there is an imbalance of qi and blood affecting both sides, with the interaction of yin and yang, it is preferable to use Jin Dan (golden elixir) or Huomming Decoction with Qiang Huo and Ju Qing. For robust individuals, administer Ba Zhen San or a single Jin Dan. If the seven evil symptoms are few, what worries should there be about difficult healing? With depleted vitality, what can be done for supplementing treatment?</p>
<p>Regarding the abscess in the missing basin area:</p>
<p>Someone inquired about a sixty-year-old man with an abscess developing in the middle of his shoulder, experiencing severe chills and fever, poor appetite, tension in the shoulder and back, difficulty with urination, and abdominal distension. It was said: This condition is known as the missing basin abscess, also referred to as clavicular abscess, belonging to the Stomach channel of the Yangming foot and the Sanjiao channel of the Shaoyang hand. It is advisable to perform garlic moxibustion and to first take Zijindan (purple gold elixir) or Duoming Dan (death-defying elixir) to alleviate the severe symptoms. As he experiences difficulty with urination, administer Liu Yi San for relief; afterward, take Shi Quan Da Bu Tang (all-encompassing great supplement soup) for stabilization. If treatment is delayed even a little, it will certainly lead to ulceration. This condition generally has minor blood but abundant qi, with the wound edges not closing, and it can be critical and serious.</p>
<p>Regarding the abscess on the back of the shoulder:</p>
<p>Someone asked about an abscess on the bone at the back of the shoulder. It was stated: This is known as upper mouse abscess, or upper connection. It results from accumulated anger and belongs to both the Taiyang and Shaoyang channels. Initially, perform garlic moxibustion, and use Huomming Decoction with Qiang Huo, Ju Qing, and Chai Hu, alongside Jin Dan and choices of Zijindan and Duoming Dan. Once it ulcerates, administer Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, Huang Qi Mu Xiang San, and Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the &quot;Medical Guidelines,&quot; there are two methods for needling and moxibustion for shoulder and back pain. The first method focuses on the lung. The text states that when lung issues are present, symptoms include wheezing, coughing, reversed qi, shoulder and back pain, and sweating. This should be treated using the pathways of the Taiyin and the Yangming Meridians. It also mentions that excess lung qi can lead to cold pain in the shoulder and back, while deficiency of qi may yield insufficient breath. Treatment should take into account whether there is an excess or deficiency of heat or cold.</p>
<p>The second method focuses on the kidney. The text indicates that if there is pathogenic influence in the kidneys, it may cause pain in the shoulder, back, and neck, as well as occasional dizziness. Treatment points include Yong Quan and Kun Lun, and one should consider areas with abundant blood for treatment.</p>
<p>For shoulder and back pain radiating to the scapula, the point known as the scapula seam (胛缝) is located below the back aorta, aligned with the tip of the armpit and arm, and should be needled 2.5 cun deep with a technique of six releases and inhalations, while the point of Wu Shu should be needled 2.5 cun deep with eight releases and inhalations.</p>

Another method: five parts at Qishe, moxibustion at Tianliao, one and a half inches at Quchi, and five parts at Tianjing. For shoulder and back pain, the point Shousanli is essential.</p>
<p>There are three methods for acupuncture and moxibustion for shoulder pain: the first is to use the Hand Yangming channel. The classic states: when a disease arises in the channel of the Large Intestine Hand Yangming, there is pain in the front shoulder and deltoid; assess the severity, heat, cold, and sinking condition to treat accordingly. The second is to use the Hand Taiyang channel. The classic states: when a disease arises in the channel of the Small Intestine Hand Taiyang, there is a sensation as if the shoulder is being pulled or the deltoid feels like it will break; assess the severity, heat, cold, and sinking condition to treat accordingly. The third is to address the tendons. The classic states: the tendon of the Hand Taiyin may cause pain around the shoulder and pull in the neck; symptoms include ringing in the ears and pain; conditions in the channels of Hand Yangming and Foot Taiyang also lead to shoulder immobility. All treatment involves burning needles or stabbing, determined by the number and location of pain.</p>

<p>Medical Case</p>
<p>&quot;The Confucian Family&#39;s Responsibilities&quot; states: When comforting a patient in the early stages of illness, there is pain in the right shoulder and arm without any control, inability to move, excessive sweating, and emaciated muscles, unable to lie flat—when lying down, the pain worsens. The classics say: Excessive sweating leads to emaciation. I ponder the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; which states: The void and the solid are adjacent; resolve and allow them to connect. It also says: Leaving emaciation unchanged, puncture at the joints to ensure the meridians are harmonized, and blood and qi will recover. It furthermore states: For those who have sunk down, apply moxibustion. For the yang qi sinking into the yin, there is occasional pain in the shoulder and unable to move. Direct fire to guide it upward, supplement and warm it. The above evidence all suggests acupuncture and moxibustion are suitable, specifically first to needle the well points of the twelve meridians. On April 12, at the shoulder well point, first needle, then apply moxibustion with twenty-seven cones, until the sore emerges, the emaciated area gradually adds muscle, sweating decreases, and the shoulder and arm regain some strength. On May 8, do moxibustion again at the shoulder well point, then at the cubital gorge (Chǐ zé) with each receiving twenty-eight cones, guiding the qi downward, connecting with the defensive qi. The next day the arm adds more strength and can move again. It was mid-summer, the heat gradually intensified, so I used Qing Fei Yin to supplement lung qi, nourish the spleen and stomach, and stabilize the mind&#39;s qi.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Case&quot; states: A man suffered from a toxic condition in his shoulder, marked by swelling, hardness, and pain, with severe symptoms recurring. Three qian of powdered alum were mixed into pills and taken with a decoction made from seven green onions; the swelling and pain subsided. After taking this again, all symptoms also retreated. Additionally, two doses of a legendary life-saving drink were given, and the condition resolved completely. This secret formula is called &quot;Thousand Gold Decoction to Transform Toxins,&quot; and is prepared with powdered alum and onion soup; because the powder is hard to take, it is made into pills. A certain practitioner treats sores and abscesses without regard to swelling or rupture by using this medicine for two or three doses first, then applying detoxifying medication, achieving excellent results. Those who frequently treat leeches find that using this alone leads to resolution, without necessitating expelling medications. This is because it only targets heat toxins and does not deplete blood and energy. If a person develops sores from metal or stone poisons, it is particularly effective, as alum also neutralizes these poisons. In another instance, five qian of powdered alum and five fen of cinnabar were taken with hot wine, which also proved effective. This medicine expels toxins, soothes the intestines, stops diarrhea, detoxifies, and drains pus without disturbing the internal organs or harming energy and blood—beneficial and without harm. The ingredients are easily obtainable, and its effects are significant, especially in remote areas where this knowledge should not be overlooked. In cases of bites from insects or dogs, applying hot melted ointment to the affected area and taking the powdered medicine mixed with hot wine also yields results.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the upper chamber of Chen Lixue&#39;s residence, it began with a slight chill beneath the left shoulder. Three days later, a white swelling appeared beneath the right shoulder, swollen like a cup, red like a wine vessel. I used a cooling medicine to dispel it, but it did not ease. Then I administered the formula for relieving pain. The pain increased slightly alongside the redness. Next, I continuously gave doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, cinnamon, liquorrice, and rhizome, and after the pus drained, there was nausea and vomiting, incessant nasal congestion, coldness, shivering, profuse sweating, and a clear discharge from the top. This was a mistake in the administration of the cooling medicine; I quickly removed the wrapped medicine and gave a large dose of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, rehmannia, ginger, and aconite. The original chill beneath the left shoulder began to warm. I then administered another dose to reduce the swelling and warmth; the swelling was high and the pus was thick. Plus, I applied a chinese herbal ointment for several days, which expelled necrotic tissue in pieces the size of fat membranes. I continued the earlier medicine for two doses each day, increasing ginseng and astragalus to eight taels, finally stabilizing after more than two months. After recovery, whenever there was overexertion, I would prescribe ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, ginger, and aconite in large doses, and thus the patient would revive.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from painful shoulder caused by a toxic condition, experiencing agitation and constipation, with a rapid and strong pulse. After administering two doses of a cooling drink, he improved slightly; then, after taking four doses of honeysuckle powder, he completely recovered. Following that, using a decoction of Xie Xuan San with additional tianhua fen, the sore burst and healed. Both the pulse and symptoms indicated excess.</p>
<p>Another person had a carbuncle on the shoulder, with a rapid pulse. One dose of locust flower wine immediately reduced the symptoms; then, after applying more than ten patches with honeysuckle, astragalus, and licorice, the condition stabilized. The efficacy of locust flower wine in treating damp-heat is remarkable and quick. However, those with stomach cold should not take an excessive amount.</p>
<p>A woman had a lump that wouldn’t resolve, with clear pus that wouldn’t congeal. I gave her Ba Zhen Tang, which helped slightly; however, she suddenly experienced pain in her shoulder and back, making it difficult to turn her head. This was due to stagnation of the bladder meridian, and she should be treated with Feng Feng Tong Qi Tang. The bladder meridian starts from the inner corner of the eye, goes up to the top of the head, down to the corner of the ear, then back up to the crown and down to the back of the brain, passing through Feng Fu, down the neck to the shoulders, and extends down to the lower back. When this meridian is active, it causes back pain and a stiff neck, giving the sensation of being broken. What else could this be if not a bladder meridian issue? However, she claimed her lump was a problem with the gallbladder meridian, where the pulse indicates movement on the side of the neck, which occurs due to heat in the meridian. She then took herbs to clear the liver and reduce fire, leading to loss of appetite and exacerbated pain. When she asked me to diagnose again, the pulse indicated that her stomach qi was weaker. I started with Si Jun Zi Tang, adding dried tangerine peel, fried peony root, pinellia, notopterygium, and vitex for four doses, after which her appetite returned and the pain ceased; I then followed up with two doses of Feng Feng Tong Qi Tang, and she was cured.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wang Qiao, over thirty years old, suffered from a toxic condition. He used a dose of Ginseng Detox Powder, then added ten Xuan San without ginseng and cassia, incorporating honeysuckle and flower powder in four doses, leading to an outbreak. In anger, his liver fire was stirred, and with wind-heat obstructing upward, his face and head became red and swollen, experiencing pain from drinking cold. He applied Jingfang Detox Powder, adding Scutellaria and Lianhua, but it did not respond. </p>
<p>In a hurry, he used a needle on the affected area, resulting in the expulsion of black blood about the size of a cup; still, one dose was administered, and much of the condition retreated. Afterward, he took four additional doses of Ginseng Detox Powder, achieving recovery. </p>
<p>Illness can vary in surface and internal conditions, and treatment can differ in urgency, invasion, supplementation, and support. If one does not use acupuncture or needling, the toxic qi can become trapped in the flesh, and medicine will not be effective, leading to an aggravation of heat and swelling. Using harsh, aggressive medications would mean that the exterior heat has not been addressed while the internal cold has already set in, which would undoubtedly be fatal.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

<p>A man had a shoulder abscess for several days, with general swelling and slight pain. His head was swollen with many lumps, each about the size of millet, with unchanged color and no suppuration. This indicated deficiency of Qi and blood, which was confirmed upon pulse diagnosis. First, he took two doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction to mitigate the major issue; then, he used a drug to promote suppuration. Even though the abscess burst, only blood and fluid flowed, indicating that his Qi and blood were still deficient and could not form pus. He wished to take Taiyi Pill, but I advised that this medicine only targeted toxins and could not promote resolution. He did not fully believe me and continued taking it. After four doses, he could not eat, the abscess appeared black and sunken, and he experienced continuous belching, indicating extreme deficiency of stomach Qi. He did not improve.

She experienced slight swelling in her lower abdomen, which grew large like an inverted bowl in the spring of the Jia Chen year. Her left scapula was also swollen, but its color remained normal. After some treatment, about three bowls of fresh blood were drawn with a needle; she had sharp abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, cold limbs, vomiting, and chills, at times accompanied by fever, and had refused food for seven days. Her pulse was strong and broad, intermittently faint, indicating a depletion of yang energy. </p>
<p>For treatment, six ingredients were applied, supplemented with three qian of roasted ginger and two qian of aconite. Taken from morning until noon, there was no response; after a second dose, aconite was increased by five qian. She fell into a deep sleep, and upon waking, many symptoms had significantly improved. She was given a little thin porridge. After four additional doses, all symptoms subsided, and her diet returned to normal, but abdominal pain resumed. Another needle was used to draw out about two bowls of clear pus, and her symptoms reappeared, indicating extreme deficiency.</p>
<p>Thus, a formula of ten complete tonics was combined with one qian each of ginger, cassia, and aconite; after three doses, she felt stable.

Initially, moxibustion was applied, but gradually the swelling became elevated, hard, and painless. After fifteen days, it had not yet ulcerated, and he experienced increasing agitation. Fearing the situation would worsen, I first used a needle to relieve it, followed by bloodletting, which drew out a considerable amount of foul blood. Afterward, there was some relief, and I applied an ointment to dissolve the necrosis, which was used for three days, after which the ulcer began to necrose. By the twentieth day, proper pus also emerged, the necrotic tissue gradually sloughed off, and new tissue began to grow. Other treatment methods were exhausted. The patient had a close relationship with a physician from internal medicine, relying on him for oral medication while neglecting the external surgical methods I recommended. He insisted on his own views and ignored my advice, leading to inadequate treatment, as he believed that two qian of ginseng daily was sufficient.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I said it is not enough; the standard should be five qian, and with an additional two qian for thoroughness, it would be considered appropriate for treating disease. Otherwise, there will certainly be complications. They all did not believe me, and in the end, the flesh color turned pale white, the wound edges spread wide, the pus was clear and thin, and appetite decreased—these are evident signs of decline. Even though they forcefully took warming and spleen-tonifying medications, they ultimately did not respond. As for the body wasting away, with foul-smelling pus, extending to sixty days, draining all vital energy and blood leading to death, only then would they regret it. They did not realize that for large sores, if a bowl of pus comes out daily, ginseng must be at least three qian, and this is a rule. Moreover, in this condition where pus is produced, if three bowls of pus come out daily, using only two qian of ginseng is barely a small remedy compared to a significant loss—how could it not lead to death? External wounds are particularly prone to leaking vital energy. If loss and tonification do not conflict, there will be no way to balance them, often leading to situations where rescue is impossible. This illustrates disbelief in tonification, clinging to common views, and thus inviting demise; how unfortunate!<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>
