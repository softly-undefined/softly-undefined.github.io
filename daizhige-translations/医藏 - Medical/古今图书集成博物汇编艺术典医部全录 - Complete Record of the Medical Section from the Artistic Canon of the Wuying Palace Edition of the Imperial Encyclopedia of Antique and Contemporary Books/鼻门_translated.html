      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p>Title: Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Texts, Volume 151</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Gateway</strong><br>(Details on nasal bleeding are described in &quot;Blood Gate,&quot; and will not be repeated here.)</p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong><br><strong>Discussion of the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>In the West, the color white corresponds to the lungs, opening the orifice at the nose.<br>(Notes: The western direction is associated with metal, represented by the color white. The lungs are classified as a metal organ, with the nose being their orifice.) In spring, it is common to suffer from nasal bleeding.<br>(Notes: &quot;Common&quot; refers to the external conditions affecting the five organ channels; when wind harms the muscle layers, it can easily enter the channels. Nasal bleeding is a symptom relating to the head and face. Spring is a time when energy is abundant in the head, thus leading to a higher incidence of nasal bleeding.) Additionally, it is stated: In winter, do not press on the knees; in spring, do not have nasal bleeding.<br>(Notes: Pressing on the knees refers to massage and guiding techniques to promote the flow of yang energy in the limbs. In winter, yang energy remains stored; if one forces it to move outward, it cannot generate the vital energy of spring, resulting in nasal bleeding.)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The lungs govern the nose.<br>(Notes: The lung energy connects to the nose, and when lung function is harmonious, the nose can discern aromas. Thus, the lungs are in charge of the orifice at the nose.)</p>
<p><strong>Separate Discussion of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The five energies enter through the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs. When the heart and lungs are ill, the nose suffers as a consequence.<br>(Notes: The heart and lungs, positioned above, represent yang; the lungs cover the heart and govern qi, opening to the nose. Therefore, when they are diseased, it negatively affects the nose.)<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>Hot Discussion</h3>
<p>In the case of cold damage lasting two days, the Yangming channel is affected. Yangming governs the flesh, and its meridian connects the nose and eyes; hence there is body heat, eye pain, and a dry nose that prevents sleep.<br>[Note: The energy of Yangming governs the muscles and flesh. Body heat indicates the illness of Yangming energy. Although the disease is in the energy, the Yangming meridian connects the nose and eyes and is associated with the stomach, hence the symptoms of eye pain and dry nose. The stomach is not harmonious, thus sleep is unattainable.]</p>
<h3>Needle Hot Discussion</h3>
<p>For those with spleen heat disease, the nose is red at the tip.<br>[Note: The Earth is situated in the center, hence the red tip of the nose.]</p>
<h3>Needle Method Discussion</h3>
<p>When evil energy invades the foot Yangming channel, it causes sneezing and nasal bleeding.<br>[The foot Yangming meridian rises from the nose; when evil energy invades it, it leads to sneezing and nasal bleeding.]</p>
<h3>Discussion on Qi Stagnation</h3>
<p>When heat from the gallbladder moves to the brain, it results in nasal congestion. Nasal congestion is defined as continuous discharge of turbid nasal mucus. This can lead to bleeding.<br>[Note: When the gallbladder energy rises, heat enters the brain. The areas beside the nose are referred to as &quot;nape.&quot; The term indicates the nose&#39;s nape is pungent and sour. Nasal congestion refers to the continuous discharge of turbid mucus. The brain is the sea of essence and marrow; marrow fills the bones, and the brain is Yin, so when the brain becomes congested, this produces mucus. Yang Yuanru stated: The kidneys govern the storage of essence and reside below, while the brain is the sea of essence and marrow situated above; the gallbladder is the storehouse of central essence. All three govern the storage of essence and are interconnected, hence the bile evil can enter the brain. When heat energy rises and pressures the meridians, it results in bleeding.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>On the Great Theory of Qi Exchange</strong></p>
<p>When the year of Wood does not reach [its peak], there are coughing and sneezing.<br>(Note: The lungs open to the nose, hence the coughing and sneezing. Sneezing refers to the flow of clear mucus from the nose. &quot;Rebirth&quot; indicates a mother’s stagnation causing a child’s return.) When the year of Metal does not reach [its peak], the people suffer from sneezing and nasal congestion.<br>(Note: Sneezing is associated with lung diseases.)</p>
<p><strong>On Pulse Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The Yangming, known as the guest Sun pulse, leads to headache, nasal congestion, and abdominal distention. The Yangming combines with the upper: thus, the Sun connects with the Taiyin. Therefore, headaches, nasal congestion, and abdominal distention occur.<br>(Note: The movement of Yin and Yang qi rises and falls, entering and exiting, circulating in the qi space outside the pulse. The qi space exists between the skin and muscles. The &#39;upper&#39; refers to the skin. The superficial pulses, which are commonly observed, are all connected vessels. The pulse of the Foot Taiyin is also found at the skin&#39;s surface and is not hidden; therefore, the qi of Yangming converges at the top, pressing against the Sun network, and with the Taiyin meridians. Pressing against the Yangming Sun network causes headaches and nasal congestion, while pressing against the Taiyin meridian leads to abdominal distention.)</p>
<p><strong>On the Essential Great Theory</strong></p>
<p>The Great Yang governs the heavens, and the people suffer from sneezing and nosebleeds.<br>(Note: The sneezing and nosebleeds are indicative of excessive Yang heat.) In the Lesser Yin&#39;s resurgence, there is agitation, sneezing, and if severe, it enters the lungs, leading to coughing and nasal discharge. The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when the guest prevails, there is sneezing.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Notes:</strong> Sneezing indicates an excess of the Jueyin (Liver) Qi.<br><strong>Shaoyang (Lesser Yang) controls the sky; excessive cases lead to sneezing and nasal bleeding.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Essence of Subtle Issues</strong>  </p>
<p>Tears and mucus originate from the brain; the brain is yin, and the marrow fills the bones, thus brain condensation results in tears.  </p>
<p><strong>Great Discussion on the Five Constants</strong>  </p>
<p>When analyzing the order of balance, it pertains to the lung, which governs the nose.<br><strong>Notes:</strong> The lungs open to the nose.<br>Shaoyang controls the sky; when fire Qi descends, lung Qi ascends, leading to coughs, sneezing, nasal bleeding, and nasal congestion.<br><strong>Notes:</strong> The ascent of lung Qi corresponds to the descending Qi of the sky, fearing its dominance, thus it follows suit. Coughs, sneezing, nasal bleeding, and nasal congestion are all lung disorders.<br>Taiyang (Greater Yang) controls the sky; when cold Qi descends, heart Qi ascends, leading to coughs and a propensity for sadness.<br><strong>Notes:</strong> When cold Qi descends, the stored Qi ascends. Fire nature rises, while water nature descends. When fire Qi trends upward, frost and cold recompose it. Coughs and sneezing show a tendency for sadness, as fire heats and transforms.<br>Shaoyin (Lesser Yin) controls the sky; when heat Qi descends, lung Qi ascends, resulting in sneezing, nasal bleeding, and nasal congestion.<br>Yangming (Bright Yang) controls the sky; in its initial phase, people suffer from nasal bleeding, sneezing, yawning, and vomiting.<br><strong>Notes:</strong> Nasal bleeding, sneezing, yawning, and vomiting relate to the Qi of wind and wood.<br>Shaoyang controls the sky; in the third phase, people suffer from nasal bleeding and sneezing.<br>Shaoyin controls the sky; people suffer from nasal bleeding, with Yangming leading to sneezing.<br>When heat arrives, nasal bleeding occurs.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Acupuncture Techniques</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: I have heard that when the five epidemics arrive, they can easily transmit among each other. The heavenly passage has always been open and can return to its former state. When the energy exits from the brain, it does not interact with邪 (evil influences). </p>
<p><strong>Evil Qi and Organ Illness Forms</strong></p>
<p>The twelve meridians and three hundred sixty-five channels, all of their blood and energy rise to the face and access the empty orifices. The ancestral energy emerges from the nose and produces an odor. </p>
<p><strong>Essence of the Mind</strong></p>
<p>The lungs store energy; the energy houses the spirit. If lung energy is deficient, then there will be nasal congestion and difficulty in breathing, and if it is excessive, there will be wheezing and fullness in the chest, leading to upward breaths.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p>
<h3>Meridians Chapter</h3>
<p>The foot Taiyang is also known as Feiyang; its branch diverges to the Shaoyin. When there is fullness, it causes nasal congestion and pain in the head and back; when there is deficiency, it leads to nasal bleeding. The hand Yangming meridian of the large intestine has a branch that runs alongside the nostrils. The illnesses it produces are yellowing of the eyes, dry mouth, and nasal bleeding. The foot Yangming meridian of the stomach begins at the intersection of the nose and jaw and descends following the outer side of the nose. The illness it causes is nasal bleeding. [Note: All of these conditions arise from the pathways followed by the meridians.]</p>
<h3>Oral Inquiry Chapter</h3>
<p>The mouth and nose are the gateways of qi.<br>[Note: The mouth, nose, ears, and eyes are all cavities; hence, it is said that the mouth and nose are the gateways of qi.]</p>
<h3>Master’s Transmission Chapter</h3>
<p>The nasal passage extends long to correspond with the large intestine. The nostrils are external, allowing the bladder to leak. [Note: The nose is the opening of the lungs, and the large intestine is the organ of the lungs, thus the nose corresponds with the large intestine. The bladder is the organ responsible for fluids; when qi transforms, it is released, and when the air from the nostrils is expelled, it indicates the bladder is leaking, showing that the upper openings connect and the lower openings discharge.]</p>
<h3>Five Observations and Five Agents Chapter</h3>
<p>The nose is the official of the lungs. When the lungs are diseased, there is wheezing and flaring of the nostrils. [Note: The official is referred to as the one in charge. By observing the condition of its official, one can discern the illness of the organ.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p>
<h3>The Essay on Anxiety and Anger</h3>
<p>When a person&#39;s nasal passages discharge mucus uncontrollably, it indicates an inability to open the jaw, resulting in a loss of the division of Qi.<br><strong>[Note: The liver meridian runs through the throat into the jaw. The jaw is an upper orifice of the palate. The air and mucus from the mouth and nose connect through this point, hence it is known as the point where Qi is discharged. When a person&#39;s nasal passages discharge mucus uncontrollably, it is due to the jaw not being able to open, leading to a loss of the division of Qi.]</strong></p>
<h3>The Essay on Pulse Measurement</h3>
<p>The lung Qi connects to the nose; when the lung is harmonious, the nose is able to discern scents and odors.<br><strong>From the Difficulties of Bian Que&#39;s Canon</strong></p>
<p>The nose belongs to the lungs, and its function is associated with the heart.</p>
<p>In the fortieth difficulty, it is said: &quot;The lung governs voice, and the nose, as a reflection of the lung, is able to sense scents; what is the reasoning behind this?&quot; Indeed, the lung represents the metal of the western direction. Metal is born during the time of the Si (Snake), which corresponds to the southern fire; this fire represents the heart. The heart governs odors, thus allowing the nose to discern scents.<br><strong>[Note: The lung is metal. Voice emanates from metal, hence the lung governs voice. The heart is fire; the transformation of fire produces the five odors, thus the heart governs odors. The lung governs voice, and though the nose belongs to the lung, if it cannot perceive sound, how can it discern scents? The reason lies in the lung&#39;s association with metal. Metal thrives during the Si hour, in the southern positions of Si, Wu, and Wei. Si is the place where fire is administratively situated and in the organs corresponds to the heart, which governs odors. Though the nose belongs to the lung, the lung, as metal, is born from the position of heart fire, allowing the nose to discern scents.]</strong><a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Jinkui Yaolue (Essential Prescriptions of the Gold Coffer) by Han Zhang Ji</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion with Clear Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>Lung abscess, chest fullness and distension, swelling of the whole body and face, nasal congestion with clear discharge, inability to perceive scents or tastes, cough with reversed qi, wheezing, and blocked breathing are treated with the Tsing Li Da Zao Xie Lung Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Dry Nose</strong></p>
<p>In cases of alcoholic jaundice, there may be no fever, clear speech, fullness in the abdomen, and a dry nose. If the pulse is floating, induce vomiting first; if it is deep and taut, use purgation first.</p>
<p><strong>Zhong Cang Jing (Classic of Internal Storage) by Han Hua Tuo</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inability to Smell and Constant Clear Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>In lung wind conditions, there is fullness in the chest, unintentional sweating, inability to smell scents, and wheezing that prevents lying down, which can be treated. If the lung is full, there will be clear discharge from the nose.</p>
<p><strong>Death Color</strong></p>
<p>If the lung is deceased, the nostrils will open and turn black, with the black color starting at the nose and gradually moving to the mouth, indicating death. If black and white appear in the mouth, nose, or eyes, death will occur in five days.</p>
<p><strong>Renzhai Zhizhi Fang (Directives of the Benevolent Studio) by Song Yang Shiying</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nasal Soreness</strong></p>
<p>Nasal soreness occurs when the lung is harmed by cold wind, leading to stagnation of fluids. The nasal airflow is hindered, and scents cannot be sensed. Use the Xiong San (Sichuan Peony Powder) appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Jisheng Fang (Prescriptions for Saving Life) by Song Yan Yonghe</strong><a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>On Governance</strong></p>
<p>The nose is the indicator of the lungs, and its function should be harmonious; when harmonious, it can draw in both fragrance and odor. However, if the seven emotions are repressed internally, and the six external pathogens harm it, dietary factors and labor may prevent the nasal energy from venting and regulating, leading to blockages in the clear pathways. The resulting ailments include: nosebleeds, boils, nasal polyps, ulcers, clear nasal discharge, blockage and congestion, impurities, or the inability to perceive scents. All these arise from imbalances in the lungs, with pathogenic energy accumulating in the nose and obstructing the clear pathways. </p>
<p>For treatment, if it is cold, warm it; if it is hot, clear it; if it is blocked, unblock it; if it is congested, disperse it—nothing must be overstepped beyond this principle. However, in the case of an epistaxis induced by environmental factors, it should not be hastily stopped; if the bleeding exceeds three &#39;sheng&#39; (a measure), one may consider intervention. As mentioned in the &quot;Book of Living&quot; concerning nosebleeds, they are a release, largely due to an excess of Yang energy. This is something one must be aware of.</p>
<p>The nose governs the lungs, serving the functions of purification and adjustment. When these functions are performed properly, the lungs will be unimpeded, and the clear pathways will be of benefit. If there&#39;s an improper method of nourishment, the clear pathways become obstructed, resulting in nasal ailments. The lungs are related to air, while the liver is related to blood. When these are harmed by pathogenic heat, the blood becomes mature; when the blood heats, the air also heats, causing both blood and air to become hot and rise rebelliously, leading to nosebleeds, and potentially sores in severe cases. </p>
<p>If wind and cold invade, obstructing the Yang channels, congestion can occur, resulting in clear discharge. If this accumulation does not disperse, one will lose the ability to sense scents, leading to nasal congestion, or possibly nasal pain due to polyps. Additionally, if heat flows into the bile, and the pathogens move to the brain, it can result in nasal obstruction. Nasal obstruction, in this context, is characterized by continuous discharge of muddy mucus. It is said to cause dizziness and is thus attributed to deficient energy.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Abscess and Ulcer Compendium</strong> 【Jin □ Dou Hanqing】</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Polyp (Nasal Hemorrhoid)</strong></p>
<p>The nose is located in the center of the face, functioning as a passage for the blood circulation of the entire body, and the nostrils connect to the lungs. Its energy ascends to the brain and descends to the lungs. When the lung energy is clear and the flow of qi and blood is unobstructed, no diseases arise. However, when the lung energy is abundant and there is any blockage, various diseases will develop. The nasal polyp, known as nasal hemorrhoid, arises from the influence of the six external factors and seven emotions. If it grows upwards and enters the eyes, it is called pinguecula. If it grows downwards and enters the nasal cavity, it is called nasal polyp. When there is obstruction and blockage, one should avoid alcohol and control desires, eliminate worries, and refrain from sadness. Take decoctions internally and apply topical medicines externally, in hopes of restoring balance.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Hejian Six Writings</strong> (by Liu Wansuo)</p>
<p><strong>Drying of the Nose</strong></p>
<p>When the nostrils are dry, it is the essence of metal in the lungs. The lungs store qi, and if the blood is depleted internally, qi becomes deficient or is affected by wind, resulting in dryness. Wind can overcome dampness, and heat can consume fluids; both can lead to dryness. Hence, the classics say that wind, heat, and fire are all yang, while cold, dampness, and dryness belong to yin. Additionally, although dry dampness is different, the dryness of metal, though associated with the autumn yin, is distinctly different from cold dampness. Dryness is more prominent with wind, heat, and fire; thus, when wind and heat are severe, they can also coincide with dryness from cold and dampness. Therefore, when cold results in vomiting and diarrhea, causing a loss of fluids leading to dryness, it follows this principle. The classics state that all symptoms of withering and dryness are related to dryness.</p>
<p>Concerning the symptoms of cold damage, one may experience pain in the head and neck, stiffness in the lower back and spine, a rigid body, surface heat with aversion to cold, no restlessness, no spontaneous sweating, or may have headaches, muscle warmth, nasal dryness, or chest fullness with wheezing, fingertips feeling slightly cold, and a pulse that is floating, rapid, and tight. These indicate that pathogenic heat is at the surface, aligning with the symptoms treated by Ma Huang Decoction, or similar formulas such as Tian Shui San.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Heat transferred from the gallbladder to the brain results in painful, dry nasal congestion, with continuous thick discharge, flowing like a spring without interruption, persisting for a long time and potentially causing nosebleeds. Fang Feng Decoction is the primary treatment for it.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>Nasal discharge is when clear mucus comes from the nose. The principles of the five elements dictate that when something is mild, it corresponds to its original transformation, but when it is extreme, it can involve supernatural forces. Thus, it is said: when the yang is excessive, it harms the body’s ability to control. The Book of Changes states: the element that dries out all things the most is fire. Fire refines metal; when it reaches extreme heat, it transforms into water, and when the body reaches extreme heat, it manifests as sweat. Water is inherently gentle, and when it is extremely cold, it can turn into ice like the earth; the earth itself governs moisture and brings forth clouds and rain, and when it becomes overly moist, it can cause violent storms. Wood represents warmth and fosters growth, but strong winds can make it cold and cause breaking. Metal represents coolness; when autumn coolness reaches its peak, all things can become dry. All of these illustrate that when something is pushed to extremes, it can turn into supernatural disturbances, which is a counteraction to its excess. Hence, when liver heat becomes excessive, tears are produced; when heart heat is excessive, it results in sweat; when spleen heat is excessive, it generates saliva; when lung heat is excessive, it leads to nasal discharge; and when kidney heat is excessive, it results in spittle. The texts say: heat in the nose results in turbid nasal discharge. All phlegm, saliva, nasal discharge, and spittle that are thick and turbid indicate extreme fire heat, leading to a melting effect. Some mistakenly say that nasal discharge is due to lung cold; they only observe the discharge and sneezing that occur with cold exposure and conclude hastily, not realizing that cold damages the skin and fur, causing the pores to close tightly, leading to exacerbated conditions due to extreme heat and stagnation. When pressing the lower abdomen, if there is inner pain as if water were being poured, a deficiency might manifest in urination, leading to clear nasal discharge. The sun moves directly down from the top into the channels of the brain, with energy flowing down to the nose, resulting in incessant clear nasal discharge.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Nasal Congestion</p>
<p>Nasal congestion refers to blockage and obstruction. Fire, which governs (the facial region), swells and inflates, causing heat to invade the Yangming channel and resulting in swelling in the nose, leading to obstruction. Some argue that cold governs closure and mistakenly attribute nasal congestion to cold, which is erroneous. The essence is that when Yang energy is abundant above and one lies on their side, the upper orifices become open and clear, while the lower orifices can become blocked. This is because the channels of Yangming intersect on the left and right, with the left channel entering the right orifice and the right channel entering the left orifice. Therefore, if wind-heat accumulates and the affliction is biased towards the left, the right orifice becomes blocked in response. Common understanding does not recognize that the channels of Yangming intersect and lead to the nostrils. They see lying on one&#39;s side resulting in open upper orifices and blocked lower orifices, and mistakenly suspect it is cold. Thus, the path of negation reveals the oscillation of lung metal (Qi) in rise and fall.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>
<h3>Disease Manifestations</h3>
<p>Spleen WIND causes a yellow nose, Spleen HEAT causes a red nose.</p>
<h3>Sneezing</h3>
<p>Sneezing occurs when the nose itches, causing air to expel with sound. The nose is the orifice of the lungs, and itching is a transformation of fire. When heart fire, an evil heat, disturbs the Yangming, it manifests in the nose leading to itching, hence the sneeze. Sometimes, when external irritants cause itching and result in sneezing, it is due to this itch being associated with fire. If one sneezes upon looking at the sun, it is because the eyes are the spiritual essence of the five organs; true solar fire from sunlight shines on the eyes, causing the heart spirit to become agitated and generating heat upwards, thus leading to nasal itching and sneezing. In cases where a cold illness has progressed and one sneezes, it is because heat has dissipated, leaving behind deficiency heat that causes itching; when this itching arises in the nose, it results in sneezing. If wind heat attacks upwards causing obstruction in the head and nose, with a floating pulse but no other symptoms, internal medicine affecting the nose can lead to sneezing, relieving the obstruction. If pain occurs during sneezing that becomes unbearable, it is because the air from the sneeze assaults and binds the pain, preventing it from being relieved.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Ten Books of the Eastern Garden</strong><br><em><strong>Li Gao of the Yuan Dynasty</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>When the lung is harmonious, it can distinguish between aromas and odors.</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;True Words of the Golden Coffer&quot; states: In the West, there is white, which enters and connects to the lungs, opens the orifices at the nose, and stores essence in the lungs. Of the twelve meridians and three hundred sixty-five vessels, their qi and blood all ascend to the face and pass through the orifices. The essence and yang qi ascend to the eyes and become vision; the separate qi travels to the ears and becomes hearing; the ancestral qi exits through the nose and distinguishes odors. The &quot;Classic of Difficulties&quot; says: The lung qi connects to the nose; when the lung is harmonious, it can indeed distinguish between aromas and odors. The yang qi, or ancestral qi, is all derived from the qi generated in the stomach. Though their names differ, their principles are the same. If one is affected by hunger, satiety, or exertion, harming the spleen and stomach, the generated qi becomes weak, and the operant qi cannot ascend; thus, the obstructions impede the orifices, so the nose is not clear, and one cannot detect aromas or odors. Therefore, one should nourish the stomach qi to allow the yang qi and ancestral qi to rise, which will clear the nasal passages. </p>
<p>Moreover, another perspective from the &quot;Classic of Difficulties&quot; states: the heart governs the five odors, while the lung governs qi. Regarding the nose, it is the orifice of the lung that perceives aromas and odors. Why is that? It is because, when discussing orifices, we refer to the lung, while in terms of function, we refer to the heart. When the defensive qi is compromised and the cold pathogens invade the head and face, the nose is also affected, rendering it ineffective; thus, one cannot perceive aromas or odors. Therefore, the classics state that when the heart and lungs are ill, the nose is adversely affected. The ancient saying asserts: When sight and hearing are clear and refreshing, and aromas and odors can be distinguished and are warm, this is it. The treatment should first disperse the cold pathogenic factor, then replenish the defensive qi, allowing the qi of the heart and lungs to communicate; thus, the nose will become clear, and one will perceive aromas and odors. The Lize Tongqi Decoction is the main remedy for this.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Flowing Clear Mucus</strong></p>
<p>In the third month of winter, the Yin energy is outside, while the Yang energy is stored within. One should assist the Yang energy from the outside, avoiding sweating, and internally consume the Yin fire without allowing it to leak out. This is the essential principle of closing and preserving. Midwinter is the time when Water is vigorous; with strong Water, Metal grows strong, where the child can make the mother fruitful. The lungs are the mother of the kidneys, and the original Yang of the skin and hair is inherently weak. When aided by winter, those who are ill may frequently sneeze, have a runny nose with clear mucus, and when the cold is severe, they may produce turbid mucus. Sneezing does not stop; they are more severely affected by wind and cold than usual, experience frequent and insufficient urination, or may notice their urine is clear and abundant. Their bowel movements may be irregular; they suffer from cold at night and sleeplessness. In severe cases, this may lead to phlegm cough, vomiting, foulness, throwing up, or spitting white foam, progressing to the mouth opening, eyes bulging, and breath not circulating, nearly leading to collapse. For this condition, the formula of Wu Zhu Yu pills is prescribed.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>The lungs harbor evil and pathogen, combined with dryness and heat, causing nasal obstruction, sneezing, bleeding from the nose, and blood leakage. For those with a very dry and floating pulse, administer the Peach Kernel Purging Decoction; for those with a mild condition, use the Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction; for severe cases, the Resisting Decoction or the Resisting Pill for mild cases. The nose is an orifice of the lungs and becomes obstructed due to illnesses of the heart and lungs. There can be both cold and heat, which harm the skin and hair, leading to obstructed qi. When obstructed, the clear pathway is hindered, necessitating unblocking. For cold, treat the surface with herbs like Ephedra and Cinnamon Twig; for heat, clear it with herbs like Scutellaria, Coptis, and Fructus Gardeniae.</p>
<p><strong>Body belongs to the lungs, function belongs to the heart</strong></p>
<p>The classics state that the five qi enter through the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: the lungs govern the nose; when the nose is harmonious, it can discern fragrances and odors. As stated in &quot;Jiegugu,&quot; seeing and hearing are clear and refreshing, fragrances and odors are discerned and warm, which allows internal reception of heaven&#39;s qi to benefit the nine orifices. The orifice of the sanjiao opens at the throat and exits through the nose. The nose is the orifice of the lungs; this indicates the body. The ability to perceive fragrances and odors reflects its function. The heart governs the five odors and is situated in the nose; thus, all functions of the nine orifices draw upon life essence. The life essence of the heart is located in the You position, which corresponds to the lungs, so the nose is utilized by the heart to perceive fragrances and odors. Therefore, when the lungs are ill, the nose suffers obstruction. This indicates the clear qi is served by heaven while the heart is overexerted and the stomach weakened, leading to the reception of evil.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong> [by Zhu Zhenheng of the Yuan dynasty]</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion from Alcohol</strong></p>
<p>Nasal congestion from alcohol is caused by heat from the blood entering the lungs. It is advisable to use the Four Substance Decoction, adding tangerine peel, safflower, and wine-fried Huangqin. Boil these in a good wine and mix in ground Wulingzhi to take together. In the &quot;Gexi Lun,&quot; it mentions that the upper medicine includes Poria and ginger, and those with weak qi should add Astragalus. </p>
<p>Nasal congestion from alcohol arises from obstructed heat. The lung qi communicates with the nose, and it is the pathway for the clear qi to enter and exit. If one drinks alcohol, this can cause stagnation of qi and blood, leading to heat in the upper burner, with evil heat remaining stagnant, resulting in nasal sores. There is also a type caused by lung wind that arises spontaneously and is not solely due to alcohol. </p>
<p>For treatment, it is advisable to use a single ingredient to wash away the phlegm, taken after meals with cold drinks. Externally, use sulfur mixed into radish, roasted and ground to apply. If the tip of the nose is slightly red and sores form inside the nose, grind magnolia flowers, mix with a bit of musk and apply it wrapped in cotton; or use papaya leaves, remove the hair, grind them, boil in water, allow to cool, and take after meals to disperse wind.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Further Discussions on the Principles of Understanding</strong> by Zhu Zhenheng</p>
<p>When the face and nose become cold, they turn black.</p>
<p>All yang energy gathers in the head, making the face the utmost yang within yang. The nose sits at the center of the face, while the yang brightness originates from the mouth. The blood of the entire body flows to the face and nose, where the blood in the yang regions is exceedingly pure and refined. The nature of wine is to promote movement and is exuberantly warm but has a strong and acute toxicity. Those who consume much wine experience a vaporous intoxication; the blood from the wine becomes excessively hot, and when this hot blood is met with cold, it is attacked by yin energy, causing profuse sweat and stagnation of impurities, thus leading to a transition from purple to black. It is essential to dissolve the stagnant blood to allow for circulation and to generate new blood, which can then be processed, so that the illness may be cured. I create a medicinal formula combining the Four Substance Decoction with fried Mitreola, Poria, dried tangerine peel, fresh licorice, wine red flower, and ginger. Decoct and mix with powdered Five Spirit Resin; for those with weak qi, add wine astragalus—no one fails to respond to it.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Medical Principles of Ancient and Modern Times</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Xu Chunfu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diseases Related to the Lungs</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The nose is the external manifestation of the lungs. It is also said: In the west, the color white corresponds to the lungs and opens up to the nose. Furthermore, it is stated: When there is excess heat in the nose, it results in the discharge of turbid mucus. It is also noted that if the heart and lungs are ill, it is detrimental to the nose. According to &quot;Chao&#39;s Sources of Disease,&quot; it is said that the lungs open to the nose, and if heat invades the blood, then the qi is also heated. When both the blood and qi are heated, blood may be expelled from the nose, causing nasal bleeding, and if severe, it can lead to massive bleeding from the mouth and ears as well. Additionally, it is stated: When the lung organs are harmonized, the nasal qi flows smoothly, allowing one to discern scents. However, if evil influences invade the Taiyin, and their qi accumulates in the nose, then bodily fluids become blocked, preventing the nasal qi from circulating properly, which leads to an inability to discern scents and results in a foul condition. Finally, issues such as sores transforming into excess tissue, blockages, or runny noses are all due to the stagnation of pathogens in the lung meridian.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Illness Belongs to Fire</strong></p>
<p>The nose itches and air is expelled, resulting in a sneeze. Itching is caused by the transformation of fire; the heart&#39;s fire and pathogenic heat disturb the Yangming channel, leading to itching and sneezing in the nose. There are cases where one sneezes due to external disturbances and others who sneeze when looking at the sun; this is because the true fire of the sun shines upon the eyes, disturbing the heart, causing heat to rush upwards, resulting in itching and sneezing in the nose. </p>
<p>When wind-heat attacks upwards, causing congestion in the head and nose, or when pain follows sneezing, despite different symptoms, they are all manifestations of heat. Although the diseases may differ, the pathogenic heat invading the channels does not differ. Nasal congestion and itching are due to heat affecting the Yangming stomach channel. A runny nose, on the other hand, is due to heat affecting the Taiyin lung channel. </p>
<p>The nose is governed by the foot Yangming stomach channel, where the Yangming vessels intersect and lead to the nostrils. Furthermore, the nose is the orifice of the lungs, thus the lung qi communicates with the nose; the pathogenic heat affects both channels, manifesting as nasal congestion or runny nose. Therefore, it is stated: when the heart and lungs are ill, the nose becomes affected.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>Nasal congestion and nasal polyps are both caused by the accumulation of pathogenic qi.</p>
<p>The lung qi connects to the nose, serving as a pathway for the entry and exit of clear qi. When heat and pathogenic factors obstruct the lungs, causing stagnation in the upper burner, this accumulation does not disperse, leading to nasal and polyp issues.</p>
<p>Nasal redness and bleeding are indicative of heat entering the lungs.</p>
<p>Nasal congestion is often seen in those who drink alcohol. The pathogenic heat from alcohol permeates the face and nose, causing blood heat and resulting in a runny nose that appears red. Additionally, some individuals may have a pre-existing wind-heat condition in the lung channels, which can also cause redness in the nose even without alcohol.</p>
<p>When nasal passages are not clear, treatment should involve dispersing with acrid and draining with bitter flavors.</p>
<p>Heat in the heart and lungs can obstruct the nose. This could be due to external wind-cold and internal heat causing congestion, preventing olfaction. Symptoms may include clear nasal discharge or itching leading to sneezing. Treatment should include acrid herbs such as Ephedra, Cinnamon Twig, Asarum, and Magnolia Flower to disperse. If the issue is solely due to internal heat without external factors, bitter herbs like Scutellaria, Coptis, and Gardenia should be used to drain. These two methods are the primary strategies for treating nasal issues.</p>
<p>Nasal sores.</p>
<p>Nasal heat causes sores that are red in color and do not have any obstruction inside, which indicates blood heat. Treatment should include raw Rehmannia, Siwu Decoction with prepared Scutellaria, red flower mixed with honey, and herbs like Ophiopogon and Asparagus.</p>
<p>Nasal discharge.</p>
<p>The scripture states: &quot;When gall bladders transfer heat to the brain, it leads to nasal discharge.&quot; Liu Hejian used Fengfeng Tongsheng Powder combined with peppermint and Coptis, each in two qian, to be decocted and taken.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p>
<h3>Nasal Sourness</h3>
<p>Nasal sourness is caused by phlegm and heat; it is suitable to use Liangge San with additions of Schizonepeta spikes and Platycodon.</p>
<h3>Nasal Itching</h3>
<p>Nasal itching occurs due to heat generating wind; it is advisable to use Fangfeng Tongsheng San with additions of Blighted Aconite and Silkworm.</p>
<h3>Food Entering the Brain</h3>
<p>Suddenly, food may shrink in from the nose to the brain, causing a sharp pain that cannot be relieved; cow’s lard is very beneficial.</p>
<h3>Medical Transmission</h3>
<p>Nasal Conditions</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: In the west, white corresponds to the lungs and opens into the nose. It also says: The nose is the exterior indication of the lungs. Danxi mentions: The lungs are a viscera located high, with a fragile structure; they are averse to both cold and heat. Therefore, those who enjoy drinking hot liquor may initially injure the lung viscera, and prolonged heat will manifest externally as nasal congestion and a red tip of the nose. When heat intensifies, it turns red; when cold, it turns black. This indicates extreme heat, akin to water, which, when excessive, harms the nourishing aspect and requires moderation. If one encounters wind and cold, it will initially harm the skin, leading to nasal blockage. It may present as thick phlegm or a clear discharge, persisting over time, known as nasal flux; this indicates an external cold binding an internal heat condition. The &quot;Original Disease Formula&quot; states: Lung heat leads to nasal discharge. There is also the possibility of heat from the gallbladder moving to the brain, resulting in a pungent nasal flux, with thick nasal discharge like a gushing spring that does not penetrate and persists; this can lead to bloody nasal flux or blocked nasal passages. Each should be treated according to its type.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The right cun pulse is floating, surging, and rapid, indicating nasal bleeding and nasal congestion. The left cun pulse is floating and slow, suggesting a cold-related nasal blockage with clear nasal discharge. The nose is the gateway of the original female principle.</p>
<p>Laozi said: The Valley Spirit never dies, this is the original female. The gateway of the original female is the root of heaven and earth. It is ever-present but does not demand labor. What is the gateway of the original female? The answer: The nose connects to the qi of heaven, called the original gate; the mouth connects to the qi of the earth, called the female door. Thus, the nose is indeed the gateway of the original female.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> [Ming □ Dai Sigong]</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>A blocked nose with continuous nasal discharge can have differing causes of cold and heat. Clear discharge indicates cold in the brain and lung, which should be treated with spices like xixin, wufu, and dried ginger. Turbid discharge, as mentioned in the &quot;Plain Questions,&quot; indicates that heat from the gallbladder has moved to the brain, resulting in nasal phlegm. One should use protective herbs, such as fangfeng and sweet chrysanthemum, and differentiate between the clear and the turbid regarding cold and heat. </p>
<p>If there is an excessive clear discharge not caused by cold injury, or if it is yellow, white, or occasionally mixed with blood resembling brain marrow, this arises from kidney deficiency. One should avoid excessive use of cold agents and instead use tonics like the Brain Supplement Powder, Black Tin Pill, Purple Spirit Pill, or Spirit Sand Pill. </p>
<p>If there is a cold or heat injury, leading to a blocked nose and significant discharge, a remedy to open the passages should be used.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p>
<h3>Color Diagnosis</h3>
<p>If I am in good health, but the tip of the nose appears bluish-yellow, this person must have a type of urinary sickness; if the tip is slightly white, it indicates blood loss; if red, it signifies heat in the blood.</p>
<h3>Nasal Blockage</h3>
<p>The nasal passages are associated with the lungs, and the ability to sense smells is linked to the heart. When the body&#39;s water rises and fire descends, and the protective and nourishing energies are balanced, the nose facilitates the continuous exchange of breath. However, if cold damages the skin, the nose becomes blocked and functions poorly; if internal fire obstructs the clear channels, one cannot detect smells. For a recent onset of cold symptoms, with nasal blockage, heavy voice, runny nose, and sneezing, it is advisable to treat with remedies for wind and cold, such as modified Qiang Huo Decoction, Shen Su Drink, or Xiao Feng Bai Jie Powder. Over time, with slight exposure to wind and cold, nasal blockage and similar symptoms may arise due to lingering fire in the lungs; symptoms intensify with a preference for heat and aversion to cold, indicating internal fire manifesting from mild colds. It is best to use remedies that clear metal, descend fire, and facilitate air flow, like Liang Ge San with additions of Jing Jie and Bai Zhi, or Chuan Lian Shi Gao San. Additionally, if nasal blockage is persistent and dry in all seasons, with an inability to smell, one should use remedies to clear metal, reduce fire, and resolve phlegm, such as Qing Qi Hua Tan Wan or Shang Qing Wan. Traditional formulations for severe nasal blockage include Yu Han Decoction and Cheng Qie Wan; for inability to perceive smells, use Tong Qi Tang; in cases with hard obstructions, San Nan Xing Drink for nasal application, using external preparations of Bi Ba cake, and equal parts of Shi Chang Pu and Zao Jiao ground into powder, wrapped in cotton to block the nose while lying on the back for some time; for cases of deficiency and cold, use Tong Cao Wan.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>The nose is the pathway for the entrance and exit of clear air. Clear air is the vital energy produced within the stomach. If the nose is blocked for a prolonged period, the air becomes stagnant and unable to circulate, causing heat to accumulate in the brain, leading to a disorder of clear and turbid substances, resulting in nasal congestion, epistaxis, and deep congestion. Nasal congestion occurs when clear mucus flows from the nose, accompanied by slight heat. For this, prepare a formula of Er Chen Decoction with added herbs like Chuanxiong, Angelica, Xixin, Baizhi, Fangfeng, Qianghuo, and Juema, decocted with ginger and a little mint. If symptoms persist, use Zhi Yi Powder, adding mint, Jingjie, Huangqin, Shenchu, Banxia, and Nanshin, and take it after meals as a decoction, while also applying Xixin ointment externally.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Nasal Morbidities</strong></p>
<p>Regarding nasal disorders, when there is a flow of turbid discharge from the nose, and the heat is intense, use Jinfei grass and increase the dosage of Huangqin. Add a piece of phoenix shell, burn it to retain its essence, and take it as a decoction. For lung wind, disperse the wind with &quot;Xiao Feng San,&quot; adding ash to enhance its effectiveness. If there is lung fire causing nasal discharge, cough with purulent or bloody sputum, use Jie geng decoction or Ren shen Ping lung powder. If there is heat from the gallbladder affecting the brain, leading to foul-smelling nasal discharge, apply &quot;Fang Feng Tong Sheng San&quot; with mint and Huanglian added, or use Zhi Yi powder. For external application, burn the stems and young shoots of Cang Er to ash, mix with vinegar, and apply inside the nose. Chronic nasal issues can lead to nosebleeds, and &quot;Fang Feng San&quot; is the primary remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Brain Silt</strong></p>
<p>For foul-smelling yellow discharge, it may lead to headaches or what is popularly known as brain silt. If there are worms affecting the brain, take a silk gourd vine near the root about five feet long, burn it to retain its essence, and grind it into powder mixed with wine. For deficiency issues, use Chuanwu powder; externally, take white ox tail hair and orange leaves equally ground and blow into the nose. If there is blood present, adding dried mountain gardenia is also beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Nasal congestion shows as redness at the tip, which can turn purple or black in severe cases. This occurs due to blood heat from drinking alcohol entering the lungs, compounded by wind cold; prolonged stagnation results in blood thickening and turning red. Those who do not drink may face lung wind and blood heat, suitable for Siyu San with Erchen Decoction, removing Banxia and adding Honghua and Huangqin. Boil the ingredients in water, add a small amount of wine, and mix with Wulingzhi powder for consumption. If there is Qi deficiency, add Huangqi, and regularly consume Danshan Zhi pills or Huanglian Ejiao pills. Occasionally use Shengma Heqi drink or swallow Qing pills to eliminate the root of the illness. For external application, use Huanglian powder, tian diao teng ash, adjusted with tung oil, or sulfur powder.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Nasal Pain</strong></p>
<p>Nasal pain occurs when wind evils enter the nose, interacting with the body&#39;s vital energy, blocking the nasal passages, hence causing pain. Treatments include Huoxiang Zhengqi Powder and Qu Feng Tongqi Powder. If phlegm and heat disturb the lungs, there will be hidden pain in the nasal septum; in such cases, use Erchen Decoction combined with Huangqin, Shanzhi, Juye, and Maidong.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Sores</strong></p>
<p>Nasal sores can be minor or severe; the former is a simple nasal sore, while the latter is known as nasal hemorrhoids, both caused by lung heat. For sores inside the nose, brew loquat leaves, let it cool, then mix with Xiaofeng Powder and consume after meals. Avoid hot foods like fried ginger and garlic. Externally, use powdered Xinyi, mixed with a little bait and musk, to pack into the nose.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>Nasal hemorrhoids are caused by intense lung heat, which over time can congeal and form fleshy growths resembling jujubes, blocking the nasal passages. In severe cases, they are also known as nasal polyps. It is advisable to use Feng Tong Sheng San, adding Sanleng and haizao powder for consumption. Externally, use powdered Xinyi as the main ingredient, with a little Xixin and apricot seeds, mixed with sheep marrow and pig fat to make an ointment. Allow it to cool, then incorporate realgar, alum, and a little musk to form pills packed into the nose, which should be removed after a few days. In severe cases, a little nianshu may be added, or Guafang powder can also be effective. If heat and phlegm from food cause hemorrhoids, taking Cang&#39;er Wan internally and applying it externally will be most effective for digestion, or use two qian of alum, one qian of Xixin, and five fen of Baizhi, ground into powder to pack into the nose.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method</strong><a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Nasal conditions primarily require methods to disperse wind and clear heat. For those affected by wind-cold from the outside, treat with warmth to disperse. For wind-heat that has become trapped internally, either due to prolonged external exposure causing heat or from internal factors like excessive warmth from food and clothing, the heat generated by liver fire can cause nasal congestion and runny nose. It is advisable to clear heat and cleanse metal.</p>
<p>For prolonged conditions, nurturing blood and supplementing the kidneys is essential. If nasal discharge and congestion persist without improvement, it often indicates either a deficiency of heart blood or a lack of kidney water. Nourishing blood will generate vitality, thereby reducing heat, while supplementing the kidneys will elevate water levels to cleanse metal. This applies even for long-standing nasal sores or hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Additionally, persistent nasal congestion that does not improve must stem from internal damage to the lungs and stomach, which prevents the clear qi from rising and is not solely due to external factors. It is appropriate to use the formula &quot;Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi&quot; for harmonization. This discussion focuses on the root treatment principles.</p>
<p>Regarding the causes of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profuse thick nasal discharge indicates the brain has been affected by wind-heat.</li>
<li>Clear nasal discharge indicates the brain has been influenced by wind-cold, with heat trapped inside.</li>
<li>Foul-smelling nasal discharge signifies a deficiency below.</li>
<li>Nasal obstruction is caused by damp-heat in the Yangming.</li>
<li>Nasal sores arise from Yangming wind-heat and blood heat or potentially parasites within the organs.</li>
<li>Nasal pain is due to Yangming heat.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Medical Outline</strong></li>

<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Nasal congestion is associated with the lungs. The texts say: &quot;The lung qi connects to the nose; when the lung is harmonious, the nose can perceive smells.&quot; It is also said: &quot;The five qi enter the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs. If the heart and lungs are diseased, the nose will likewise suffer.&quot; Furthermore: &quot;The west is associated with the color white, which connects to the lungs, opens up the nasal orifices, and stores essence in the lungs.&quot; It is said: &quot;The lungs govern smell; within the organs, it is the lungs, and in the orifices, it is the nose.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>When qi is disturbed, nasal discharge is also related to heat. The texts say: &quot;In the case of the Lesser Yin&#39;s recovery, if severe, it enters the lungs, causing cough and nasal discharge. It should be treated with bitter cold remedies.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Sneezing</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of nasal sneezing related to qi: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first is fire attack, caused by lung deficiency and results in nasal sneezing. The texts state: &quot;The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when hot qi descends and lung qi ascends, this leads to sneezing and nasal blockage.&quot; It is noted: &quot;The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; if hot excess prevails, people suffer from sneezing and vomiting.&quot; Furthermore: &quot;The Lesser Yang governs the heavens; when hot excess prevails, it can lead to severe sneezing.&quot; Additionally: &quot;In the recovery of the Lesser Yang, there is agitation with sneezing.&quot; It is said: &quot;The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when external factors prevail, it leads to sneezing.&quot; Also: &quot;If the year’s metal does not balance, the fiery heat prevails, causing people to suffer from sneezing.&quot; It adds: &quot;When metal is imbalanced, it is called transformation; the condition leads to sneezing and coughing, which should be treated with various cold remedies.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second type is due to metal assistance, arising from lung fullness resulting in nasal sneezing. The text states: &quot;When the Yangming reaches its peak, sneezing occurs, and it should be treated with warming agents.&quot;<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>Ming Medical Miscellany</strong><br><strong>By Wang Lun</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Nasal Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Nasal blockage prevents the perception of scents and odors. This may occur due to cold weather causing frequent obstruction, or slight exposure to wind and cold can lead to blockage. Many in society attribute this to lung cold and prescribe exterior-releasing and warming medicines, which are ineffective. However, they do not realize that this condition stems from excessive internal heat in the lung meridian, where the邪火 is quite strong, causing a preference for warmth and aversion to cold, resulting in blockage during cold encounters and symptoms upon exposure. The primary treatment should focus on clearing the lungs and reducing internal heat, supported by remedies that promote airflow. </p>
<p>For habitual nasal blockage where scents and odors are not perceived, further examination of the individual&#39;s usual condition is necessary. One should treat it as lung heat, clearing the metal element, dispelling heat, and resolving phlegm, potentially using pills that dissolve in the mouth or powdered medicines that can be taken lightly and over a long period, all of which have proven effective in my experience. </p>
<p>For instances of nasal obstruction arising suddenly without a prior history of blockage, often triggered by wind and cold, one should treat it as a wind-cold condition. </p>
<p><em>Note: If the obstruction is due to being overworked or issues with hunger and fullness, leading to weak stomach qi that cannot rise, it may impair the empty orifices, resulting in an inability to perceive scents. It is advisable to nourish the spleen and stomach to allow the yang qi to rise, which will clear the nasal passages. According to Dong Yuan, if bile heat moves to the brain, it can cause nasal issues, to be treated with Fengfeng Decoction. In general, much of this stems from disordered stomach qi.</em><a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable Remedies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The nose is the passageway to the lungs, governing the pathways for the intake and outflow of clear air. When the qi and blood are harmonized, and the yin and yang rise and fall appropriately, then breathing is smooth and the protective and nurturing energies circulate freely. When the nose is clear, one can sense both fragrance and odor. However, when the six excesses and seven emotions influence the body, alongside inner and outer injuries, as well as issues from diet and fatigue, the nasal qi can become obstructed, leading to a blockage in the clear pathways. </p>
<p>If there is accumulated heat in the yangming, it may force the blood to flow erratically, resulting in a condition known as epistaxis when it exits from the nostrils. Heat dries up the bodily fluids, while cold allows the brain&#39;s essence to flow down. Sometimes, wind and cold enter through the qi into the meridians, ascending to the brain and descending to the nose, resulting in an inability to contain the discharge, referred to as rhinorrhea. </p>
<p>If cold obstructs and blocks the nasal passages, one may be unable to detect fragrances or odors, resulting in nasal blockage. Prolonged stagnation of the blood vessels can lead to chronic entanglement and increasing obstruction, ultimately leading to the formation of nasal polyps. If qi becomes stagnant above, causing the evil heat to remain trapped, it results in nasal ulcers, which can eventually deteriorate into a more severe condition that produces foul-smelling discharge. In essence, the ailments of the nose are primarily due to wind and heat.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>The text discusses various conditions related to nasal blockage and the interaction of heat and cold within the body according to traditional Chinese medicine. It explains that nasal blockage can arise when fire energy is excessive, leading to swelling and heat affecting the nasal passages. The text clarifies misconceptions about cold causing nasal blockage, emphasizing that heat, especially in the Yang channels, can also lead to congestion. It mentions how the body positions and intersections of energy pathways influence nasal health, as well as how different organ systems (liver, heart, spleen, lung, kidney) express their heat through specific secretions like tears, sweat, saliva, and mucus. It concludes by noting that thick and turbid secretions result from intense heat, particularly when the gallbladder&#39;s heat affects the brain, leading to ongoing nasal discharge.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Some say that a runny nose is due to cold in the lungs; they only see the nasal discharge and congestion worsening in cold conditions, leading them to this conclusion. Yet, they do not realize that cold damages the skin and hair, causing the pores to close tightly, which makes the trapped heat more painful. When a sneeze is hindered, it is due to itching within the nose causing a release of air that makes a sound. The nose is an opening to the lungs, and itching signifies a fire-like transformation. Evil heat from the heart interferes with the Yangming, manifests in the nose, and leads to sneezing. Some sneeze when an irritant disturbs their itch; this is linked to blood. Some sneeze when looking at the sun; this occurs because the eyes are the essence of the five organs, and the true fire of the sun dazzles the eyes, leading to agitation in the heart and rising heat, which causes itching in the nose and sneezing. In cases of cold damage resulting in weakness, sneezing occurs due to the retreat of heat, leaving residual heat that causes itching; the itch manifests in the nose, leading to a sneeze. In cases of wind-heat attacking upward, with congestion in the head and nose, a floating pulse without other signs, internal medicinals may help induce sneezing, thereby alleviating the congestion. There are cases where a sneeze causes unbearable pain; this pain arises because the force of sneezing attacks and disrupts blockages. All three manifestations pertain to heat. Thus, although the illnesses are different, the pathogenic heat affects various meridians differently.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Nasal obstruction and itching are caused by heat affecting the Yangming Stomach meridian. Sneezing and nasal discharge arise from heat affecting the Taiyin Lung meridian. The nose is governed by the foot Yangming Stomach meridian, and the Yangming vessels intersect on both sides at the nostrils. The nose is also an orifice of the lungs, so the lung qi connects to the nose. When external heat obstructs the two meridians, it manifests in the nose as obstruction and discharge. Consequently, it is said that when the heart and lungs are ill, the nose suffers as a result. </p>
<p>The treatment depends on identifying the meridian affected by the pathogen. If symptoms worsen due to external wind and cold, and one erroneously treats it with warming remedies, they might temporarily improve. However, it’s important to understand that cold returning to heat can cause stagnant, turbid qi, obstructing the clear pathways, leading to these symptoms. If one uses spicy and sweet expelling herbs to open the pores and dispel stagnation, it will release the Yang heat. </p>
<p>For mild cases, this may suffice, but for more severe cases that are deeply obstructed, even if cooling and dispersing remedies are used, one may merely achieve temporary relief. The key lies in accurately assessing the severity of internal and external heat. Therefore, using appropriate spicy, warm, cool, or balanced medications is necessary. In all these cases, successful treatment relies on the physician&#39;s ability to recognize and address the illness effectively, ensuring complete healing.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p>
<h3>Medical Principles: Six Essentials [by Ming Zhang Sanxi]</h3>
<h4>General Discussion</h4>
<p>It is commonly known that the lungs open to the nose. However, the Yangming channel intertwines with the nasal network and eyes, converging at Yingxiang, the point located five fen from each nostril. When wind pathogens enter through the face, they invade the Yangming channel, causing congestion and obstructing the flow of qi, which results in clear nasal discharge that may eventually turn turbid over time. This reflects the principle of external cold constraining internal heat, which is highly sensible. One must disperse it with pungent herbs. Formulas often employ Shengma, Gegen, Baizhi, and scallions as remedies associated with the Yangming meridian. When stagnation and heat persist, and one fails to resolve it, one must add cooling pungents like wine, Kuqin, and mint. If a wine drinker overindulges in rich, spicy, and hot foods, heat can rise, blocking the orifices, leading to nasal obstruction. This may manifest as thick nasal discharge, eventually causing symptoms like nasal dryness, nosebleeds, nasal polyps, and nasal hemorrhoids. This aligns with the passage in the &quot;Suwen&quot; about the gallbladder transferring heat to the brain.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Blocked and Unable to Breathe</strong></p>
<p>Nasal congestion during the cold months must be treated by adding ephedra and asarum to the Shengma and Gegen decoction, supplemented with croton and perilla leaves, and increasing the amount of licorice, with tangerine serving as a vehicle for success. If dispersion has occurred but not fully opened, with a strong pulse and dry mouth and nose, it should be treated with spicy and cool remedies such as wine-soaked codonopsis, gardenia, and mint. It is still necessary to include cautionary herbs like Xian, Fang, Sheng, and Zhi; avoid using cold and cooling methods hastily. </p>
<p>For those with qi deficiency, weak energy unable to rise results in nasal congestion. This is due to the nine orifices being unbeneficial, stemming from the digestive system. Taking nourishing remedies like the Baizhong Yiqi decoction regularly provides passage. This has been proven multiple times. </p>
<p>For obstruction of airflow and inability to smell or distinguish scents, the Tongcao powder is the primary remedy. </p>
<p>Phlegm-fire causing stagnation in the upper jiao, above the diaphragm, leads to closed orifices, resulting in the inability to smell or taste, or even deafness and blurred vision. This is primarily due to weak qi failing to ascend, allowing stagnant turbid qi to dominate; it is the deficiency that is fundamental and phlegm-fire that is symptomatic. One should use the Baizhong Yiqi decoction, add wind herbs like Sheng and Chai to facilitate upward flow, and also use pills for clearing and transforming phlegm and opening orifices. Careful dietary habits should be maintained, and over time, the condition will self-correct.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Yuan Zhi and Wine Stained Nose</strong></p>
<p>The fire in the upper burner is abundant, causing blocked qi and leading to nasal discharge; this is what the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; refers to as lung heat resulting in discharge. The prescription books mention that nasal discharge is due to phlegm seeping from the brain, which might not be accurate. Murky discharge is like a deep pool; the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states that heat from the gallbladder moves to the brain, resulting in a blocked nose. This is fundamentally caused by the lurking fire of the Yangming channel. It is advisable to take Feng Tong Sheng San, adding 2.5 grams each of mint and coptis, and decoct it in water for consumption. Alternatively, in the original formula, reduce the amount of realgar, talc, and gypsum by half, and double the amount of magnolia flower.</p>
<p>Nasal polyps must stem from accumulated heat in the upper burner, pent-up for a long time before manifesting externally. There should be internal treatment with cooling and purging medications; modify Er Chen and Liang Ge formulas as needed, ensuring to abstain from alcohol and pungent flavors. </p>
<p>Wine-stained nostrils result from hot blood entering the face and being obstructed by cold. When hot blood meets cold, it becomes stagnant and turbid. Take the previous medicine, while externally applying the oil extracted from Catalpa seeds mixed with coptis, and use the ash from burning Tian Diao Teng for a hot compress.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Evidence for Treatment Guidelines [Ming, Wang Kentang]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Associated Meridians</strong></p>
<p>In the area of the nose and throat, &quot;throat&quot; can also be referred to as &quot;gau.&quot; The root of the nose is commonly called the &quot;bridge of the nose,&quot; associated with the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian and the meeting of the Governing Vessel. </p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: When the gallbladder transfers heat to the brain, it leads to nasal congestion and sudden nosebleeds, resulting in closed eyes. The note states that the Foot Taiyang Bladder Meridian originates at the inner corner of the eye, crosses at the forehead to connect to the brain, while the Yangming Meridian begins at the nose and converges in the throat area, alongside the Taiyang Meridian. Today, if there is heat in the brain, the Foot Taiyang and Yangming Meridians both become excessive and thin out at the throat, causing soreness in the nose and nasal congestion. Nasal congestion means mucus flows down continuously like a fountain. When heat is excessive, the Yang channels overflow, leading to nosebleeds, which is also called &quot;melt.&quot; If blood flows excessively, the Yangming and Taiyang Meridians weaken, failing to nourish the eyes, thus leading to closed eyes.] </p>
<p>The nose is associated with the Hand Taiyin Lung Meridian. </p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: In the western direction, the color white is related to the lungs and opens to the nose, being sensitive to heat. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: Those with lung illnesses experience wheezing and nasal enlargement. It also states: If the lungs are deficient, the nose becomes obstructed and unresponsive, but when balanced, one can discern scents. Qiao Yue states: If the lungs are completely deficient, there will be no nasal discharge, and the nostrils will be black and dry, with the liver&#39;s qi overwhelming it, leading to a bluish hue. Dong Yuan states: In case of a cold, the qi from the nose becomes coarse, making it hard to close the mouth, projecting qi upwards towards heaven.] </p>
<p>It is also associated with the Hand Shaoyin Heart Meridian.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Li Dongyuan noted that the nose primarily governs the lungs, and yet it has the ability to perceive both fragrance and odor, indicating that there is a vital essence within the nose, which is influenced by the Metal element born in the Snake year. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that the five energies enter the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs; if there are ailments in the heart and lungs, it will adversely affect the nose.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is associated with the hand and foot Yangming meridians, as well as the meeting point of the Governing Vessel. Liu Hejian remarked that if a cold wind injures the skin and causes nasal congestion, the cold can constrict and obstruct the flow of Yang energy. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; says that an attack of cold for two days affects the Yangming, which governs the flesh, and its meridian connects to the nose, resulting in nasal dryness that prevents sleep. Wang Haizang noted that gypsum induces sweating and the cooling nature enters the hand Taiyin meridian. Why did Zhongjing use it to treat Yangming syndrome caused by cold? Because the stomach meridian travels in front of the body, and the chest serves as a chamber for the stomach and lungs; when evil heat exists in Yangming, it constrains the lungs with fire, so a cooling agent is used to clear the lungs, thus it is called Baihu Decoction. Furthermore, the &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that the Yangming pathway leads to nasal sneezing; &quot;jiu&quot; refers to nasal obstruction, and &quot;ti&quot; refers to sneezing. </p>
<p>In children, the area on the face is referred to as the &quot;Mingtang.&quot;<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> In the &quot;Lingshu,&quot; it states: &quot;The pulse is seen at the qi mouth, the color at the ming tang.&quot; The ming tang refers to the nose. A broad ming tang indicates longevity, while a small one suggests danger, especially in the presence of illness. This notion aligns with the theories of skilled practitioners. However, one must consider the facial features as well. I have observed that even a small ming tang, when proportional to the face, can still indicate a lifespan of eighty years; thus, one should not adhere strictly to a single interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: &quot;In cases of spleen heat disease, the nose turns red.&quot; The area five fen around the nostrils is called the Yingxiang point and is associated with the hand and foot yangming channels of the large intestine and stomach. Directly below the pupils of the eyes is the Ju Liao point, associated with the foot yangming stomach channel and Yin Qiao vein. Symptoms include ringing in the ears without being aware of food taste, lack of qi, fatigue in the limbs, unsteady gait, hair loss, inability to eat, cold knees, night sweats with discharge, a dry throat unable to rest, dry mouth and tongue with heavy sighing, inability to turn the head, tightness in the neck muscles, back pain, dizziness, dark vision, headaches, yawning, and sneezing. </p>
<p>Medicines for treating nasal congestion include: Wen Wei Bu Xue Decoction, Ginseng Decoction, Xin Yi San, Zeng Sun Tong Sheng San, Xin Yi Tang, Ti Hu San, Tong Guan San, Fang Feng Tang, Pai Feng San, and Bi Cheng Qie Wan, all of which should be used according to the specific conditions of cold and heat.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Prolonged nasal congestion leads to an obstruction. This occurs when lung qi is directed into the nose, nourishing the head and face. If there is stagnation in the upper jiao, and wind-cold invades the head, the qi becomes obstructed; cold air stagnates, clogs the fluids, and pus and mucus accumulate, resulting in the inability to smell fragrances or foul odors, thereby causing nasal blockage. Internally, take Xiongzhong Powder or Shanzhuyu Pill; externally apply Chilong Powder, Tongding Powder, Xionghuang Powder, Huangbai Powder, or Tongcao Powder. Sun Yikui stated: The large intestine is the organ of the lungs; the stomach is where the five organs receive qi. The classic says: When the nine orifices are not functioning properly, it is due to issues with the intestines and stomach. The nose governs the formless. The classic says: Clear qi connects to the heavens. It also states: The nose governs climatic changes. If the intestines and stomach are free from phlegm-fire accumulation and excess heat, then the regular ascending qi is all clear qi.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>In a year dominated by fire and heat, is it truly surprising to fall ill? If one&#39;s stomach and intestines are already prone to phlegm and accumulated heat, then the normal upward flow of energy becomes stagnated and turbid. The metal element governs descent, preferring clarity and disliking turbidity. Now, if one is subjected to the miasma of turbid air, which has built up over time, it leads to obstruction, stagnation, and the formation of phlegm and mucus. Conditions like hemorrhoids and polyp growths arise from prolonged accumulation, with internal dryness and heat kindling, while wind and cold compress from the outside, obstructing pathways and impeding the flow of qi and blood. Just as soil accumulates to form mounds, even in years not ruled by fire and heat, is there anyone who does not fall ill? Those who treat should not be confined to notions of seasonal influences. </p>
<p>Medicinal formulas like Xi Xin San, Ben Shi Tong Cao Wan, San Yin Xin Yi San, Qian Jin Xi Xin Gao, Chuan Jiao San, and Sai Bi Zhu Gao are all warming and hot remedies, and can truly be utilized for those with a cool constitution. Bai Zhi Wan should only be taken by those suffering from external pathogens.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Methods for Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Tears and nasal discharge are related to the brain. Therefore, when brain fluid seeps out, it leads to thick nasal mucus. If the nasal discharge does not stop, it is like a spring of water, hence it is called nasal congestion. &quot;Forehead&quot; refers to the nose and the area above it. The foot Taiyang channel starts at the inner canthus of the eye, ascends to the forehead, crosses the crown, and enters the brain. The foot Yangming channel begins at the junction of the nose and upper face, near the Taiyang channel. When there is heat in the brain, the foot Taiyang is in a state of counterflow, and both the Taiyang and Yangming channels are strong. This excess leads to tenderness in the nose. With excessive heat, the Yang channels overflow, causing nosebleeds and sweating. If there is excessive bleeding, the Yangming and Taiyang channels weaken, failing to nourish the eyes, resulting in closed eyes. Reversal of qi is a symptom, and this condition arises from qi counterflow; therefore, it is advisable to take a decoction of Fangfeng. If there is phlegm and qi involved, a decoction of Nanzheng is recommended.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Head wind, with clear nasal discharge like a white ribbon, is treated with Xin Yi Wan (Magnolia Flower Pills).<br>For those suffering from long-term foul nasal discharge, take a powder of assorted herbs mixed with cold water.<br>When the lungs are weak and congested, leading to nasal polyps where there is no sense of smell, use Yang Fei San (Sheep Lung Powder) for nasal ulcers, along with Chün Gen Tang (Toothwort Decoction) and Wu Xiang San (Black Aromatic Powder). Apply these ten times during the day and four times at night for immediate recovery.<br>When the nose is dry with no discharge, use Xi Jiao San (Rhinoceros Horn Powder), Sang Gen Bai Pi San (Mulberry Root White Skin Powder), or Chui Bi San (Nasal Blowing Powder).<br>For nasal pain caused by blockage in the airways, take Ren Shen Shun Qi San (Ginseng Qi Regulation Powder) internally and apply Bai Zhi San (Angelica Powder) externally. If wind-cold invades the lungs and attacks the nose, leading to nasal pain, use Mo Yao San (Myrrh Powder).<br>When the lungs are affected by wind, presenting with a pale complexion, occasional redness in the cheeks, dry skin, and blocked, painful nasal passage, this indicates &quot;deficient wind&quot;; use Bai Xian Pi Tang (White Lichen Skin Decoction).<br>For nasal congestion, dizziness, pain, and a sense of brain heaviness, use Hu Lu Jiu (Gourd Wine).<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Surgical Essentials</strong> <em>(Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong)</em></p>
<p><strong>Nasal Disorders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong><br>Nasal congestion belongs to the spleen, caused by stagnant heat in the blood that fails to disperse. It is said that what is within must manifest outside. It is advisable to use Zhenjun&#39;s Wonderful Plaster Powder, with added Baifuzi for application, and to take Loquat Leaf Pills and Huangqin Lung-Clearing Drink internally.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Hemorrhoids</strong><br>Nasal hemorrhoids arise from unclear lung qi, with stagnation of wind and dampness. The nasal polyps, resembling pomegranate seeds, gradually enlarge and droop, blocking the nasal passages, preventing proper airflow. Internally, take Xin Yi Lung-Clearing Drink, and externally apply Nao Sha Powder daily until it gradually transforms into fluid and heals. Additionally, manage diet by avoiding rich foods, refrain from haste and excessive desires; after recovery, ensure that it does not recur.</p>
<p><strong>Cerebral Leakage</strong><br>Also known as nasal dripping, this condition results from wind and cold condensing in the brain cavity, coupled with damp heat. Symptoms include constant flow of thick nasal discharge, sometimes yellowish, dripping continuously and not drying up. Over time, it may result in dizziness and continuous weakness. Treat with Huoxiang Decoction as the main remedy, and Tianma Cake can also help in gradual recovery. If prolonged dizziness remains, take Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and Liu Wei Di Huang Pills alternately to nourish the essence and initially improve the condition.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Medical Formula Study by Ming Dynasty Wu Kun</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Nasal Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The nose is located among the five sense organs; its illnesses are not about aesthetics. It is recorded: “If one exhausts decorative means, the practitioner will be far removed.” Therefore, we examine the five methods to treat the nose. </p>
<p>For those who have persistent nasal discharge, it is termed nasal obstruction. This is caused by wind-heat affecting the brain, damaging its vital energy. When the vital energy of the brain is unstable, fluids leak out on their own. The Cang Er San, composed of four ingredients, consists of all spicy and cooling items. The spicy elements can drive away wind, while the cooling components can disperse heat. Their light and clear nature allows them to penetrate to the crown. When the crown is clear, the brain fluids stabilize, and nasal obstruction can be cured.</p>
<p>When there are nasal polyps, causing breath to be obstructed and scents indiscernible, the main formula is the Xin Yi San. The nose is the gateway of breath; when the breath is clear, the nose is clear; when the breath is hot, the nose is blocked; and if the heat is severe, the blockage worsens—this is the reason for the growth of polyps. Therefore, treatment should focus on clearing the breath. This formula includes Xin Yi, Xi Xin, Chuan Xiong, Fang Feng, Gao Ben, Sheng Ma, and Bai Zhi, all being light, clear, spicy, and fragrant ingredients, which can clear the breath, eliminate heat, disperse evil, and open the passages.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The nature of Mugwort can facilitate communication within the body, while the gentleness of Licorice can help to clear heat. For nasal polyps, use a needle to make a slight prick, have the patient hold a mouthful of water, then mix melon seed powder with a small amount of musk, use a few drops of water to blow into the nose; this will help produce saliva and lead to healing. This bitterness can promote discharge, effectively helping to treat the polyps.</p>
<p>For those with Yang deficiency and coldness in the brain leading to nasal issues, the formula “Brain Supplement Powder” is indicated. The head is the upper part of the body, representative of Heaven’s Yang, thus all Yang energy converges in the face. If Yang energy is deficient, then Yin energy will gather, causing coldness in the brain and a runny nose. This formula includes Tian Xiong, which is hot and rising, and being hot it symbolizes the Sun, thus it can warm the brain and replenish Yang deficiency. Xin Yi and Cang Er herbs are both light and clear, acting as agents to help clear the brain, supporting Tian Xiong in this effort.</p>
<p>For a nose that is red like a pomegranate, use Da Huang powder, mixed with alcohol to apply externally. The nose signifies heat, and thus redness indicates blood. Da Huang, being cold, can help purge heat, while (Shibo) salt can help break down blood. This condition can often be found in those who indulge in alcohol, and if one does not stop drinking but merely relies on medication, it is like adding fuel to a fire—there is no benefit to the situation.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The nose is the passageway to the lungs and is also called the &#39;Yuan Pin.&#39; It is the pathway of the vital energy and the entrance to the heart and lungs; thus, the classics state that if there is disease in the heart and lungs, it negatively affects the nose. The meridians associated with it are exclusively related to Yangming; above the root of the nose, it connects with the Taiyang Governing Vessel, reaching the brain, which is why illnesses affecting these meridians can also impact the nose. In the case of illness, when there is obstruction it is called &quot;Jiu&quot; (nasal congestion). If it causes thick, foul-smelling mucus, it&#39;s referred to as &quot;Bi Yuan&quot; (nasal effusion), also called &quot;Brain Leakage.&quot; If there are growths blocking the airways, it is termed &quot;Bi Zhi&quot; (nasal polyps). Furthermore, conditions like sneezing, nosebleeds, sinusitis, and red nose must be diagnosed and treated accordingly. However, in summary, nasal diseases stem from two main sources: external influence of wind and cold, or internal heat rising. For external causes, the treatment should be to disperse with pungent herbs; for internal heat, it should be to clear and cool. Understanding these two factors will cover the main principles of treating nasal conditions.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of nasal obstruction: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>For nasal obstruction caused by wind-cold, the cold closes the pores, leading to obstruction in the meridians and frequent sneezing. This condition often occurs in the Taiyang meridian and should be treated with pungent dispersing herbs to resolve the exterior. Formulas such as Chuanxiong San, Shen Yu San, as well as Ma Huang, Zi Su, Jing Jie, and green onion can be chosen for use.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the nasal obstruction is due to upward-ascending fire evil, it is necessary to clear the fire. When the fire is mild, it is often closer to the upper jiao, arising from the heart and lungs. One should use clearing and transforming drinks like Huangqin Zhi Mu Decoction. If the fire is severe, it usually stems from the Yangming stage and may be accompanied by a slight headache. In such cases, Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction or Liangge San can be employed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In cases of concurrent wind-cold and fire, one may also use formulas like Fangfeng Tongsheng San. Generally, persistent nasal obstruction is more related to fire, while sudden blockage is more often due to wind-cold; it is important to differentiate between the two.</p>
<p>Excess nasal discharge is often attributed to fire; thus, it is said that with severe lung heat, nasal discharge increases. From this perspective, excessive tearing or salivation without cause also indicates heat in the liver and spleen, as they belong to the same category.</p>
<p>The condition of nasal dripping is mainly due to the fire in the Taiyang and Du meridians; when severe, it connects to the brain, leading to continuous discharge, hence also known as &quot;brain leakage.&quot; This condition often arises from indulgence in alcohol, excessive fatty and sweet foods, prolonged use of hot substances, or fire being constrained by cold, resulting in damp-heat rising and causing fluids to overflow and degrade, with some discharges being foul-smelling and quite unbearable. In such cases, in the Hejian area, one may use Fangfeng Tongsheng San with an addition of peppermint and Huanglian, each two qian for treatment. Historically, Cang Er San has also been used for this condition.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>However, in my view, this fire rising in heat affects both the treatment of accompanying dryness and dispersing methods, leading to unsatisfactory results. It is better to simply clear the Yang fire while also nourishing the Yin; over time, this will bring tranquility. This is the method of suppressing the excessive. Therefore, one often adds five qian or one liang of white tribulus and two or three qian of cicada shells to a cleansing beverage. If the heat is severe, one can further adjust the dosage of cooling agents to effectively achieve complete recovery. Alternatively, using a decoction like Xuanming Fangfeng Tang is also acceptable. However, once this condition occurs, it is essential to regulate and treat it early; if left untreated for a long time, it becomes very difficult to remedy. </p>
<p>In cases of nasal or cerebral discharge, although they may be heat symptoms, if the discharge has persisted for a long time, the fire pathogen is already gone, but the discharge continues because the pathway is unable to seal properly. Therefore, new cases are often due to heat, while chronic cases may not necessarily all be heat symptoms. This must be carefully assessed in treatment; if one insists on using cold and cooling methods, it may inadvertently lead to the development of other illnesses.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>If there is excessive leakage, harming the marrow sea, then the qi becomes deficient above, leading to symptoms such as headaches and dizziness. This requires the supplementation of yang, and can be treated with formulas like Sheng Qi Tang or Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. </p>
<p>Nasal polyps block the nasal passages; although the nose is an orifice of the lungs, this blockage in the patient is a disease of the meridians and muscles. This is actually due to the retention and stagnation of heat in the Yangming channel. Therefore, the internal treatment should focus on clearing fire and qi, while external treatment should utilize Huang Bai San, Qian Jin Polyp Decoction, Xiong Huang San, or simpler formulas for polyps.</p>
<p>For a red nose caused by excessive drinking, this often occurs in individuals who enjoy alcohol, leading to damp-heat invading and steaming the lungs, resulting in blood heat. Alternatively, some might develop red and black lesions from wind-heat in the lung channel. Internally, it is advisable to cool the blood and clear the fire; externally, one should use sulfur powder or alum powder for gentle application.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Secret Records of the Stone Chamber</strong> 【Qing Dynasty, Chen Shiduo】</p>
<p><strong>Swelling and Pain Caused by Fire</strong></p>
<p>When the nose is swollen, it indicates excess fire in the lung meridian and is best treated with a sweet tangerine decoction. Now, if powdered soapberry is blown into the nose, and one sneezes numerous times, relief will be achieved. This is because the congestion in the nose will be released when one sneezes, allowing the obstructed energy to disperse, hence there is no need to clear the lungs for the nasal swelling to subside.</p>
<p><strong>Large Nose</strong></p>
<p>There are people whose noses are large like a fist, causing unbearable pain. This is due to the fire heat in the lung meridian being blocked in the nose and unable to discharge. The method is to clear the evil from the lungs and remove the fire in the nose. The prescription uses three qian (a unit of weight) each of Huangqin (Scutellaria), Maidong (Ophiopogon), flower pollen, and licorice; five qian each of Jiegang (Platycodon) and Tiandong (Asparagus); two qian of Zihuan (Aster); and one qian each of Baibu (Stemona) and Suye (Perilla leaf), decocted in water for consumption; four doses will resolve the issue. This formula mainly focuses on clearing the lung meridian to eliminate its fiery evil, which is why the swelling and blockage will not persist. This is a peculiar illness treated with conventional methods.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Kong Sheng&#39;s Red Line</strong></p>
<p>A red line grows in the nose, about a foot long; if it moves even slightly, it causes excruciating pain. People believe it to be a condition caused by drinking alcohol, but I think otherwise; it is also a form of haunting. I used a mixture of borax and borneol, each one part, ground into powder, then mixed with human milk and gently applied to the middle of the red line. Suddenly, it felt as if someone had punched the patient, and in an instant, it disappeared. This is an extraordinary remedy. Borax is also known for its ability to dispel hauntings.</p>

<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; says: What causes a person to sneeze? Qi Bo replies: It is the harmonious yang qi, full in the heart, that exits through the nose, which causes sneezing. To nourish the vital essence of the yang at the eyebrows, it is also said to be above the eyebrows. The &quot;Jia Yi Jing&quot; states: When pathogens invade the channels of the foot yangming, they cause nasal discharge and cold in the upper teeth. For this, pierce the area at the junction of the nail of the middle toe and its flesh, one on each side, taking from the left to treat the right, and from the right to treat the left. </p>
<p>For headaches, body heat, nasal blockage, labored breathing, restlessness, fullness, and lack of sweating, this is treated by Quche.

<li>If there is a sore in the nasal canal causing illness, treat with Naokong.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>Nasal obstruction has no benefit, causing blockage of airways, excessive nasal discharge, and potential pus formation. For these symptoms, &quot;Yingxiang&quot; is indicated. If blood is present in the discharge, and there are hanging abscesses, with the passage blocked and unable to distinguish scents, &quot;Heliao&quot; should be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a nasal obstruction with clear discharge that cannot be stopped and blood is present, also pointing to possible pus, &quot;Heliao&quot; is appropriate. </p>
<p>For internal nasal polyps causing nasal obstruction, headaches in the forehead and temples, or ulcerations within the nose, &quot;Duanjiao&quot; is indicated. </p>
<p>If there is nasal obstruction preventing breathing, inability to gather mucus, not distinguishing between scents, along with persistent nosebleeds, &quot;Shuigou&quot; is used. If the bleeding does not stop, &quot;Chengjiang&quot; and &quot;Weizhong&quot; are suggested. </p>
<p>The &quot;Zishengfang&quot; states that when there is excessive nasal discharge, moxibustion on &quot;Yanhui,&quot; &quot;Qianting,&quot; and &quot;Yingxiang&quot; is advisable. </p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Outline&quot; notes that for clear and cloudy nasal discharge, moxibustion on &quot;Shangxing&quot; (two to seven times) will clear the excess and replenish the deficiency. </p>
<p>Another method suggests targeting &quot;Shangxing,&quot; &quot;Renzhong,&quot; and &quot;Fengfu&quot;; if there is no improvement, proceed with &quot;Baihui,&quot; &quot;Fengchi,&quot; &quot;Fengmen,&quot; and &quot;Dazhu.&quot; </p>
<p>For turbid nasal discharge: moxibustion on &quot;Shangxing,&quot; &quot;Quchi,&quot; and pricking &quot;Hegu.&quot; If still ineffective, target &quot;Renzhong&quot; and &quot;Yingxiang.&quot; </p>
<p>For nasal polyps or bleeding: focus on &quot;Fengchi,&quot; &quot;Fengmen,&quot; &quot;Fengfu,&quot; &quot;Renzhong,&quot; and &quot;Heliao.&quot; </p>
<p>For nasal blockage with inability to smell: creating a point at &quot;Yingxiang&quot; and pricking upward slightly, while avoiding moxibustion. Use &quot;Shangxing&quot; for three points. </p>
<p>Another method: target &quot;Yingxiang,&quot; &quot;Shangxing,&quot; and &quot;Hegu&quot;; if there is no resolution, moxibustion on &quot;Renzhong,&quot; &quot;Fengfu,&quot; and &quot;Baila.&quot;<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>Acupuncture for nasal congestion specifically targets the foot Taiyang meridian. According to the texts, the foot Taiyang is also known as Feiyang, located seven inches away from the ankle, and branches off to the Shaoyin. This is actually for treating nasal blockage and head pain, which is the main purpose of this technique. </p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: For moxibustion, the Yuhui point is directly above the nose, two inches into the hairline, about the size of a bean is the acupuncture point, to be moxibustion seven times. Additionally, at the Tongtian point, one inch on either side of Yuhui, moxibustion seven times. If there is foul odor in the left nostril, moxibustion on the left; if in the right, moxibustion on the right, applying the same treatment on both sides. I have used this method on several patients, and all had foul odor removed from the nose like decaying bones—unbearable smell, and their conditions were completely cured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Orthodox Surgical Texts&quot; details a secret method for treating nasal hemorrhoids. First, use fennel powder and blow into the nostrils twice. Then, take two fine copper chopsticks with a small hole drilled in one end, threading a silk string through. Maintain a gap of about five minutes between the ends of the chopsticks, inserting the ends directly onto the root of the nasal hemorrhoid. Twist the string tightly and pull down; the hemorrhoid will naturally come off. Place it in water to observe its size, and use powdered fetal hair and ivory mixed to blow into the nostrils; this will stop the bleeding. Avoid spicy foods.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue&quot; states that moxibustion at the Yuhui point seven times treats nasal issues and hemorrhoids. </p>
<p>For treating thick nasal discharge, apply moxibustion at the Shangxing point three times or seven times, and at the Tongtian point seven times; after moxibustion, nasal discharge will be expelled, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>For treating nasal obstruction and excessive mucus, apply moxibustion at Yingxiang, Renzhong, Dazhui, Hegu, Fengfu, Quchai, Baihui, and Fengchi; for foul nasal discharge, apply moxibustion three times and, if not effective, seven times.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Traditional and Contemporary Medical Systems&quot; states: Sit facing east, without interruption, performing three channels; use the hands to pinch both nostrils, treating nasal ailments. Cross the legs and sit; this also treats nasal issues. Sit with legs extended to treat nasal sores, clearing the mucus, ensuring the nasal passages are open to perceive scents. With prolonged practice, one can fully appreciate fragrances from all directions. </p>
<p>Another method: Sit with the knees together and feet apart, without interruption, performing five channels to treat nasal sores. </p>
<p>Additionally: Sit upright and stretch the waist, slowly inhaling through the nose, using the right hand to pinch the nose, gradually closing the eyes and exhaling to remove nasal polyps. </p>
<p>The &quot;Book of Nurturing Life&quot; states: Wipe the nose to moisten the lungs, consistently using the index finger on both sides of the nose bridge, wiping twenty to thirty times, warming both inside and out, known as irrigating Mount Zhongyue to nourish the lungs. </p>
<p>Furthermore, regularly remove nasal hair, as it is said to be the gateway for spirit energy in and out.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>The &quot;Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: For nasal issues that prevent one from smelling scents or odors, use a method of guidance. With the tip of the middle finger and the palm, rub and heat the acupoints for &quot;迎香&quot; (Yingxiang), and you may also incorporate movement of the breath as you do this. </p>
<p>For the breathing technique, return to the origin, focus on cleansing the life gate, imagine the kidney water rising up to Kunlun and descending to the navel. Then, from the left breast, push along the meridian down to &quot;涌泉&quot; (Yongquan), inhale and exhale there, and also direct your breath to the affected areas in the nose while shaking the tailbone. If the affliction is on the left side, push from the right nostril to the left &quot;涌泉&quot; afterwards, and visualize cleansing the navel and kidneys, imagining water flooding the crown and returning to the navel. If you experience redness in the cheeks or nose, disperse the redness, allowing the kidney water to wash the lungs, and over time it will subside.</p>
<p>For nasal congestion from wind, first clear the lung meridian by rubbing the sides of the nose with both hands to warm both inside and outside. If excess heat rises, fix your gaze on the soles of your feet while meditating.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>In &quot;Records of Uncommon Oddities,&quot; it is said: Duke Di Liang was skilled in medicine, particularly in acupuncture. During the Xianqing period, he entered the borders as commanded, traveling through Huazhou, where the streets were filled with crowds. People gathered like a wall. Duke Di Liang pulled back the reins and observed from a distance a large board with big characters stating: &quot;Whoever can cure this child shall be rewarded with a thousand bolts of silk.&quot; Upon closer inspection, he saw a wealthy family&#39;s child, about fourteen or fifteen years old, lying beneath the board with a growth at the tip of his nose, as large as a fist, its base attached to the nose like the stem of food, causing severe pain when touched. His eyes were almost closed by the growth, the whites of his eyes showing as he writhed in agony, close to death. Compassionately pondering for some time, he then said: &quot;I can treat this.&quot; The child&#39;s parents and relatives bowed their heads in prayer, promptly offering a thousand bolts of silk set beside him. The Duke ordered them to help the child sit up, then inserted a needle about an inch behind the head, asking the patient: &quot;Has the needle&#39;s energy reached the afflicted area?&quot; The patient nodded. The Duke swiftly withdrew the needle and the growth fell off easily, instantly restoring the child&#39;s eyes to their original state without pain. The parents and family, weeping and bowing in gratitude, offered him silk as a gift. The Duke smiled and said: &quot;I grieve for the severity of your situation; I am merely a physician responding hastily to a dire need. I am not a performer of tricks.&quot; He disregarded their offerings and left.</p>
<p>In &quot;The Confucian Family and Respecting Parents,&quot; it is stated: Chang Zhongming often, during hot weather, exposed his skin to seek coolness, and was taken by the wind. He suffered nasal congestion for three days, despite sitting in a warm place, and was not relieved. A person recommended the use of Tongsheng Powder, which he cooked with fresh ginger, scallion roots, and fermented soybeans. After three servings, he sweated profusely, and his nose was immediately unblocked.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: When a person has a runny nose with turbid mucus, foul odor, a thin and wiry pulse, a slippery right cun pulse, and a weak left cun pulse, first perform moxibustion at the Shangxing, Sanli, and Hegu points. Then use 2 taels of wine and Qian, 1 tael each of Cangzhu and Banxia, and 5 qian each of Xin Yi, Xi Xin, Chuan Xiong, Bai Zhi, Shi Gao, Ren Shen, and Ge Gen. Grind the herbs and divide them into seven doses for consumption to achieve complete recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Outline&quot; states: For the treatment of a man whose right nasal passage is running turbid mucus with foul odor, presenting a thin and wiry pulse, a slippery right cun pulse, and a weak left cun pulse, perform moxibustion at the Shangxing, Sanli, and Hegu points. Then use 2 taels of wine and Qian, and 1 tael each of Cangzhu and Banxia, as well as 5 qian each of Xin Yi, Xi Xin, Chuan Xiong, Bai Zhi, Shi Gao, Ren Shen, and Ge Gen. Divide into seven doses for consumption to achieve complete recovery. This is indicative of damp-heat phlegm accumulation.</p>
<p>Sun Yikui said: I once treated a person using Fangfeng Tongsheng San to eliminate yellow bile, reducing the amounts of Talcum and Gypsum by half and doubling the quantity of Xin Yi flower. First, take three to five doses, and then use this to form pills, taking seventy pills each time, swallowed with warm water in the morning and evening. A total of half a jin will lead to recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: A scholar who was diligent and suffered from wind-cold had a runny nose causing clear mucus, with cold restraining his sneezing. I said: This is due to spleen and lung qi deficiency, which cannot effectively regulate the pores. He did not believe it. After taking medicine to dispel wind, he felt numbness and fatigue in his limbs, and phlegm flowed freely, resembling a stroke. I said: This was caused by the wind remedies depleting the original qi; thus, the yin fire took over its soil position. Therefore, I supplemented the middle and replenished qi with Mai Dong and Wu Wei, treating him until recovery.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>In Honglu, Su Longxi suffered from coughing, shortness of breath, nasal congestion, and a runny nose. I prescribed a dose of Shen Su Decoction to disperse the cold pathogens, and also used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to reinforce the skin’s protective barrier, leading to recovery. Later, due to overexertion and anger, he experienced a recurrence. I used the previous decoction with additional Huang Lian and Zhi Shi; he had abdominal distension, lack of appetite, and reduced urination. I prescribed Er Chen and Si Ling, but the previous symptoms intensified, and urination became difficult. I said, “Abdominal distension and lack of appetite indicate a deficiency in the spleen and stomach; reduced urination indicates a deficiency in the lungs and kidneys; both are due to excessive attack.” I prescribed Liu Jun Zi, adding Huang Qi, Pao Jiang, and Wu Wei, and after two doses, all symptoms significantly diminished. I then used Bu Zhong Yi Qi with additional Pao Jiang and Wu Wei, and after several doses, he was completely cured.</p>
<p>For Minister Wang from the Workshop, who suffered from wheezing, coughing, thirst, a red face, and a dry nose, I believed there was heat in the spleen and lungs. I used Er Chen Decoction with additional Qin, Lian, Shan Zhi, Jie Geng, and Mai Dong, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>For County Magistrate Ruan, who had a white face and a runny nose, this indicated a deficiency in the spleen and lungs coupled with an external pathogen. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi with additional Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and Wu Wei, treating him until he recovered. Later, I used Liu Jun Zi and similar herbs for stabilization.</p>
<p>A man who had a white face and a runny nose, unable to smell any scents—pleasant or unpleasant—for three years, was treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi, adding Mai Dong and Shan Zhi, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>A scholar, whenever he coughed, would use a remedy such as ginseng and perilla drink, and would recover. However, it recurred, and he used the same medication, resulting in a hoarse throat and a weak pulse on the left wrist. I assessed that the Yin fire of the kidney was harming and overcoming the lung metal, so I treated him with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, adding Mai Dong, Wu Wei, and roasted Shan Zhi, along with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In the first year of Wujing, when a person suffered from a cold with phlegm, he used medication to disperse the exterior and transform phlegm. With excessive phlegm causing coughing, his abdomen was distended, and his face was pale—indicative of a deficiency in the spleen that could not generate lung metal. I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Jie Geng, and he immediately recovered. After three days, the previous symptoms reappeared, with a clear nasal discharge, indicating a recurrence of a cold. I used the previous medication, adding Sang Pi and Xing Ren, as well as Jie Geng, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Zhong Suzi from Changzhou had an abscess on his nose, belonging to superficial pathogenic factors, but both his qi and blood were deficient, preventing the dispersal. So, I primarily used Bu Zhong Yi Qi, supporting it with Fang Feng and Bai Zhi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In &quot;Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng,&quot; it is said that Sun&#39;s aunt had not smelled any scents for many years. Later, due to another illness, her friend Miao Zhongchun prescribed a formula, using Sang Bai Pi in amounts of seven to eight qian; after taking it for some time, her nasal congestion unexpectedly resolved.</p>
<p>In &quot;Han Shi Yi Tong,&quot; it is recorded that a nobleman had a fleshy growth in his nose, emitting an unbearable odor and causing pain upon any movement, leaving him helpless. I simply used a bit of powdered alum mixed with a small amount of Nao Sha, blowing it into the nostrils, and shortly thereafter it transformed into water and disappeared. Along with this, I applied Sheng Shi Tang combined with Xie Bai San in two doses, and he was cured. This was due to thick flavors obstructing, with damp heat steaming at the lung entrance, akin to mushrooms suddenly sprouting after the rain clears.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　夫鼻者肺之候，职欲常和，和则吸引香臭矣。若七情内郁，六淫外伤，饮食劳役，致鼻气不得宣调，清道壅塞。其为病也：为衄，为痈，为瘜肉，为疮疡，为清涕，为窒塞不通，为浊脓，或不闻香臭。此皆肺脏不调，邪气蕴积于鼻，清道壅塞而然也。治之之法，寒则温之，热则清之，塞则通之，壅则散之，无越于斯。但时气鼻衄，不可遽止，如出三升以上，恐多者方可断之。《活人书》所谓衄血者乃解，盖阳气重故也。不可不知。　　鼻者肺之所主，职司清化，调适得宜，则肺脏宣畅，清道自利。摄养乖方，则清道壅塞，故鼻为之病焉。盖肺藏于气，肝藏于血，邪热伤之则血熟，血热则气亦热，血气俱热随气上逆，故为鼻衄，甚则生疮。风寒乘之，阳经不利，则为壅塞，或为清涕，蕴积不散，则不闻香臭，或为鼻齆，或生瘜肉鼻痛之患矣。又有热流胆腑，邪移于脑，遂致鼻渊。鼻渊者浊涕下不止也。传为衄蔑瞑目，故得之气厥也。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>　　　　疮疡全书 【金□窦汉卿】</p>

<p>　　鼻孔燥干者，金肺之本，肺藏气，以血液内损，气虚或风，则皴揭。风能胜湿，热能耗液，皆能成燥。故经云，风热火兼为阳，寒湿燥同为阴。又燥湿亦异也。然燥金虽属秋阴，而其性异于寒湿，燥阴盛于风热火也，故风热甚而寒湿同于燥也。然中寒吐泻亡液而成燥者亦以此矣。故经云，诸濇枯涸，干劲皴揭，皆属于燥也。　　夫伤寒之候，头项痛，腰脊强，身体拘急，表热恶寒，不烦躁，无自汗，或头痛，肌热，鼻干，或胸满而喘，手足指末微厥，脉浮数而紧者，邪热在表，皆麻黄汤发汗之证也，或天水散之类甚佳。<br>　　　　　鼻渊</p>

<p>　　鼻塞证有二：凡由风寒而鼻塞者，以寒闭腠理，则经络壅塞而多鼽嚏。此证多在太阳经，宜用辛散，解表自愈。如川芎散、神愈散及麻黄、紫苏、荆芥、葱白之类，皆可择用。　　若由火邪上炎而鼻塞者，单宜清火。火之微者，多近上焦，出自心肺。宜清化饮、黄芩知母汤之类主之。　　火之甚者，多出阳明，或微兼头痛。宜竹叶石膏汤、凉膈散之类主之。　　若风寒兼火者，即防风通圣散之类，亦可用。大都常塞者多火，暴塞者多风寒，当以此辨之。　　鼻涕多者多由于火，故曰肺热甚则鼻涕出。由此观之，则凡无故多泪及多口涎者，亦多属肝脾之火，皆其类耳。　　鼻渊证总由太阳督脉之火，甚者上连于脑，而津津不已，故又名为脑漏。此证多因酒醴肥甘，或久用热物，或火由寒郁，以致湿热上熏，津汁溶溢而下，离经腐败，有作臭者，有大臭不堪闻者，河间用防风通圣散一两，加薄荷、黄连各二钱以治之。古法有用苍耳散治之者。<a id="orig-50p" href="#trans-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>然以余之见，谓此炎上之火，而治兼辛散，有所不宜，故多不见效。莫若但清阴火而兼以滋阴，久之自宁。此即高者抑之之法。故常以清化饮加白蒺藜五钱或一两，苍耳子二三钱。若火之甚者，再以清凉等剂加减用之，每获全愈。或用宣明防风汤之类亦可。但此证一见，即宜节戒早治，久则甚难为力也。　　凡鼻渊脑漏，虽为热证，然流渗既久者，即火邪已去，流亦不止，以液道不能扃固也。故新病者多由于热，久病者未必尽为热证。此当审察治之，若执用寒凉，未免别生他病。<a id="orig-51p" href="#trans-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>其有漏泄既多，伤其髓海，则气虚于上，多见头脑隐痛，及眩运不宁等证，此非补阳不可，宜十全大补汤、补中益气汤之类主之。　　鼻齆瘜肉，阻塞清道，虽鼻为肺窍，而其壅塞为患者，乃经络肌肉之病。此实阳明热滞留结而然。故内治之法，宜以清火清气为主；外治之法，宜以黄白散及千金瘜肉方、雄黄散，或简易瘜肉方之类主之。　　酒齄赤鼻，多以好酒之人湿热乘肺熏蒸面鼻，血热而然；或以肺经素多风热，色为红黑而生齄疖者，亦有之。内宜凉血清火，外宜硫黄散、白矾散轻搽。<a id="orig-52p" href="#trans-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>　　　　石室秘录 【清□陈士铎】</p>

<p>　　鼻肿者，乃肺经火盛也，宜用甘桔汤则效。今用皂角末吹入，打清嚏数十即愈。盖鼻因气壅，今打嚏则壅塞之气尽开散，故不必清肺而鼻肿自消也。<br>　　　　　鼻大</p>

<p><strong>Nasal Gateway</strong><br>(Details on nasal bleeding are described in &quot;Blood Gate,&quot; and will not be repeated here.)</p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong><br><strong>Discussion of the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>In the West, the color white corresponds to the lungs, opening the orifice at the nose.<br>(Notes: The western direction is associated with metal, represented by the color white. The lungs are classified as a metal organ, with the nose being their orifice.) In spring, it is common to suffer from nasal bleeding.<br>(Notes: &quot;Common&quot; refers to the external conditions affecting the five organ channels; when wind harms the muscle layers, it can easily enter the channels. Nasal bleeding is a symptom relating to the head and face. Spring is a time when energy is abundant in the head, thus leading to a higher incidence of nasal bleeding.) Additionally, it is stated: In winter, do not press on the knees; in spring, do not have nasal bleeding.<br>(Notes: Pressing on the knees refers to massage and guiding techniques to promote the flow of yang energy in the limbs. In winter, yang energy remains stored; if one forces it to move outward, it cannot generate the vital energy of spring, resulting in nasal bleeding.)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The lungs govern the nose.<br>(Notes: The lung energy connects to the nose, and when lung function is harmonious, the nose can discern aromas. Thus, the lungs are in charge of the orifice at the nose.)</p>
<p><strong>Separate Discussion of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The five energies enter through the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs. When the heart and lungs are ill, the nose suffers as a consequence.<br>(Notes: The heart and lungs, positioned above, represent yang; the lungs cover the heart and govern qi, opening to the nose. Therefore, when they are diseased, it negatively affects the nose.)<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Hot Discussion</h3>
<p>In the case of cold damage lasting two days, the Yangming channel is affected. Yangming governs the flesh, and its meridian connects the nose and eyes; hence there is body heat, eye pain, and a dry nose that prevents sleep.<br>[Note: The energy of Yangming governs the muscles and flesh. Body heat indicates the illness of Yangming energy. Although the disease is in the energy, the Yangming meridian connects the nose and eyes and is associated with the stomach, hence the symptoms of eye pain and dry nose. The stomach is not harmonious, thus sleep is unattainable.]</p>
<h3>Needle Hot Discussion</h3>
<p>For those with spleen heat disease, the nose is red at the tip.<br>[Note: The Earth is situated in the center, hence the red tip of the nose.]</p>
<h3>Needle Method Discussion</h3>
<p>When evil energy invades the foot Yangming channel, it causes sneezing and nasal bleeding.<br>[The foot Yangming meridian rises from the nose; when evil energy invades it, it leads to sneezing and nasal bleeding.]</p>
<h3>Discussion on Qi Stagnation</h3>
<p>When heat from the gallbladder moves to the brain, it results in nasal congestion. Nasal congestion is defined as continuous discharge of turbid nasal mucus. This can lead to bleeding.<br>[Note: When the gallbladder energy rises, heat enters the brain. The areas beside the nose are referred to as &quot;nape.&quot; The term indicates the nose&#39;s nape is pungent and sour. Nasal congestion refers to the continuous discharge of turbid mucus. The brain is the sea of essence and marrow; marrow fills the bones, and the brain is Yin, so when the brain becomes congested, this produces mucus. Yang Yuanru stated: The kidneys govern the storage of essence and reside below, while the brain is the sea of essence and marrow situated above; the gallbladder is the storehouse of central essence. All three govern the storage of essence and are interconnected, hence the bile evil can enter the brain. When heat energy rises and pressures the meridians, it results in bleeding.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Great Theory of Qi Exchange</strong></p>
<p>When the year of Wood does not reach [its peak], there are coughing and sneezing.<br>(Note: The lungs open to the nose, hence the coughing and sneezing. Sneezing refers to the flow of clear mucus from the nose. &quot;Rebirth&quot; indicates a mother’s stagnation causing a child’s return.) When the year of Metal does not reach [its peak], the people suffer from sneezing and nasal congestion.<br>(Note: Sneezing is associated with lung diseases.)</p>
<p><strong>On Pulse Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The Yangming, known as the guest Sun pulse, leads to headache, nasal congestion, and abdominal distention. The Yangming combines with the upper: thus, the Sun connects with the Taiyin. Therefore, headaches, nasal congestion, and abdominal distention occur.<br>(Note: The movement of Yin and Yang qi rises and falls, entering and exiting, circulating in the qi space outside the pulse. The qi space exists between the skin and muscles. The &#39;upper&#39; refers to the skin. The superficial pulses, which are commonly observed, are all connected vessels. The pulse of the Foot Taiyin is also found at the skin&#39;s surface and is not hidden; therefore, the qi of Yangming converges at the top, pressing against the Sun network, and with the Taiyin meridians. Pressing against the Yangming Sun network causes headaches and nasal congestion, while pressing against the Taiyin meridian leads to abdominal distention.)</p>
<p><strong>On the Essential Great Theory</strong></p>
<p>The Great Yang governs the heavens, and the people suffer from sneezing and nosebleeds.<br>(Note: The sneezing and nosebleeds are indicative of excessive Yang heat.) In the Lesser Yin&#39;s resurgence, there is agitation, sneezing, and if severe, it enters the lungs, leading to coughing and nasal discharge. The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when the guest prevails, there is sneezing.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>The foot Taiyang is also known as Feiyang; its branch diverges to the Shaoyin. When there is fullness, it causes nasal congestion and pain in the head and back; when there is deficiency, it leads to nasal bleeding. The hand Yangming meridian of the large intestine has a branch that runs alongside the nostrils. The illnesses it produces are yellowing of the eyes, dry mouth, and nasal bleeding. The foot Yangming meridian of the stomach begins at the intersection of the nose and jaw and descends following the outer side of the nose. The illness it causes is nasal bleeding. [Note: All of these conditions arise from the pathways followed by the meridians.]</p>
<h3>Oral Inquiry Chapter</h3>
<p>The mouth and nose are the gateways of qi.<br>[Note: The mouth, nose, ears, and eyes are all cavities; hence, it is said that the mouth and nose are the gateways of qi.]</p>
<h3>Master’s Transmission Chapter</h3>
<p>The nasal passage extends long to correspond with the large intestine. The nostrils are external, allowing the bladder to leak. [Note: The nose is the opening of the lungs, and the large intestine is the organ of the lungs, thus the nose corresponds with the large intestine. The bladder is the organ responsible for fluids; when qi transforms, it is released, and when the air from the nostrils is expelled, it indicates the bladder is leaking, showing that the upper openings connect and the lower openings discharge.]</p>

<p>In the fortieth difficulty, it is said: &quot;The lung governs voice, and the nose, as a reflection of the lung, is able to sense scents; what is the reasoning behind this?&quot; Indeed, the lung represents the metal of the western direction. Metal is born during the time of the Si (Snake), which corresponds to the southern fire; this fire represents the heart. The heart governs odors, thus allowing the nose to discern scents.<br><strong>[Note: The lung is metal. Voice emanates from metal, hence the lung governs voice. The heart is fire; the transformation of fire produces the five odors, thus the heart governs odors. The lung governs voice, and though the nose belongs to the lung, if it cannot perceive sound, how can it discern scents? The reason lies in the lung&#39;s association with metal. Metal thrives during the Si hour, in the southern positions of Si, Wu, and Wei. Si is the place where fire is administratively situated and in the organs corresponds to the heart, which governs odors. Though the nose belongs to the lung, the lung, as metal, is born from the position of heart fire, allowing the nose to discern scents.]</strong><a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Governance</strong></p>
<p>The nose is the indicator of the lungs, and its function should be harmonious; when harmonious, it can draw in both fragrance and odor. However, if the seven emotions are repressed internally, and the six external pathogens harm it, dietary factors and labor may prevent the nasal energy from venting and regulating, leading to blockages in the clear pathways. The resulting ailments include: nosebleeds, boils, nasal polyps, ulcers, clear nasal discharge, blockage and congestion, impurities, or the inability to perceive scents. All these arise from imbalances in the lungs, with pathogenic energy accumulating in the nose and obstructing the clear pathways. </p>
<p>For treatment, if it is cold, warm it; if it is hot, clear it; if it is blocked, unblock it; if it is congested, disperse it—nothing must be overstepped beyond this principle. However, in the case of an epistaxis induced by environmental factors, it should not be hastily stopped; if the bleeding exceeds three &#39;sheng&#39; (a measure), one may consider intervention. As mentioned in the &quot;Book of Living&quot; concerning nosebleeds, they are a release, largely due to an excess of Yang energy. This is something one must be aware of.</p>
<p>The nose governs the lungs, serving the functions of purification and adjustment. When these functions are performed properly, the lungs will be unimpeded, and the clear pathways will be of benefit. If there&#39;s an improper method of nourishment, the clear pathways become obstructed, resulting in nasal ailments. The lungs are related to air, while the liver is related to blood. When these are harmed by pathogenic heat, the blood becomes mature; when the blood heats, the air also heats, causing both blood and air to become hot and rise rebelliously, leading to nosebleeds, and potentially sores in severe cases. </p>
<p>If wind and cold invade, obstructing the Yang channels, congestion can occur, resulting in clear discharge. If this accumulation does not disperse, one will lose the ability to sense scents, leading to nasal congestion, or possibly nasal pain due to polyps. Additionally, if heat flows into the bile, and the pathogens move to the brain, it can result in nasal obstruction. Nasal obstruction, in this context, is characterized by continuous discharge of muddy mucus. It is said to cause dizziness and is thus attributed to deficient energy.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Drying of the Nose</strong></p>
<p>When the nostrils are dry, it is the essence of metal in the lungs. The lungs store qi, and if the blood is depleted internally, qi becomes deficient or is affected by wind, resulting in dryness. Wind can overcome dampness, and heat can consume fluids; both can lead to dryness. Hence, the classics say that wind, heat, and fire are all yang, while cold, dampness, and dryness belong to yin. Additionally, although dry dampness is different, the dryness of metal, though associated with the autumn yin, is distinctly different from cold dampness. Dryness is more prominent with wind, heat, and fire; thus, when wind and heat are severe, they can also coincide with dryness from cold and dampness. Therefore, when cold results in vomiting and diarrhea, causing a loss of fluids leading to dryness, it follows this principle. The classics state that all symptoms of withering and dryness are related to dryness.</p>
<p>Concerning the symptoms of cold damage, one may experience pain in the head and neck, stiffness in the lower back and spine, a rigid body, surface heat with aversion to cold, no restlessness, no spontaneous sweating, or may have headaches, muscle warmth, nasal dryness, or chest fullness with wheezing, fingertips feeling slightly cold, and a pulse that is floating, rapid, and tight. These indicate that pathogenic heat is at the surface, aligning with the symptoms treated by Ma Huang Decoction, or similar formulas such as Tian Shui San.</p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>Nasal discharge is when clear mucus comes from the nose. The principles of the five elements dictate that when something is mild, it corresponds to its original transformation, but when it is extreme, it can involve supernatural forces. Thus, it is said: when the yang is excessive, it harms the body’s ability to control. The Book of Changes states: the element that dries out all things the most is fire. Fire refines metal; when it reaches extreme heat, it transforms into water, and when the body reaches extreme heat, it manifests as sweat. Water is inherently gentle, and when it is extremely cold, it can turn into ice like the earth; the earth itself governs moisture and brings forth clouds and rain, and when it becomes overly moist, it can cause violent storms. Wood represents warmth and fosters growth, but strong winds can make it cold and cause breaking. Metal represents coolness; when autumn coolness reaches its peak, all things can become dry. All of these illustrate that when something is pushed to extremes, it can turn into supernatural disturbances, which is a counteraction to its excess. Hence, when liver heat becomes excessive, tears are produced; when heart heat is excessive, it results in sweat; when spleen heat is excessive, it generates saliva; when lung heat is excessive, it leads to nasal discharge; and when kidney heat is excessive, it results in spittle. The texts say: heat in the nose results in turbid nasal discharge. All phlegm, saliva, nasal discharge, and spittle that are thick and turbid indicate extreme fire heat, leading to a melting effect. Some mistakenly say that nasal discharge is due to lung cold; they only observe the discharge and sneezing that occur with cold exposure and conclude hastily, not realizing that cold damages the skin and fur, causing the pores to close tightly, leading to exacerbated conditions due to extreme heat and stagnation. When pressing the lower abdomen, if there is inner pain as if water were being poured, a deficiency might manifest in urination, leading to clear nasal discharge. The sun moves directly down from the top into the channels of the brain, with energy flowing down to the nose, resulting in incessant clear nasal discharge.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nasal Congestion</p>
<p>Nasal congestion refers to blockage and obstruction. Fire, which governs (the facial region), swells and inflates, causing heat to invade the Yangming channel and resulting in swelling in the nose, leading to obstruction. Some argue that cold governs closure and mistakenly attribute nasal congestion to cold, which is erroneous. The essence is that when Yang energy is abundant above and one lies on their side, the upper orifices become open and clear, while the lower orifices can become blocked. This is because the channels of Yangming intersect on the left and right, with the left channel entering the right orifice and the right channel entering the left orifice. Therefore, if wind-heat accumulates and the affliction is biased towards the left, the right orifice becomes blocked in response. Common understanding does not recognize that the channels of Yangming intersect and lead to the nostrils. They see lying on one&#39;s side resulting in open upper orifices and blocked lower orifices, and mistakenly suspect it is cold. Thus, the path of negation reveals the oscillation of lung metal (Qi) in rise and fall.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Disease Manifestations</h3>
<p>Spleen WIND causes a yellow nose, Spleen HEAT causes a red nose.</p>
<h3>Sneezing</h3>
<p>Sneezing occurs when the nose itches, causing air to expel with sound. The nose is the orifice of the lungs, and itching is a transformation of fire. When heart fire, an evil heat, disturbs the Yangming, it manifests in the nose leading to itching, hence the sneeze. Sometimes, when external irritants cause itching and result in sneezing, it is due to this itch being associated with fire. If one sneezes upon looking at the sun, it is because the eyes are the spiritual essence of the five organs; true solar fire from sunlight shines on the eyes, causing the heart spirit to become agitated and generating heat upwards, thus leading to nasal itching and sneezing. In cases where a cold illness has progressed and one sneezes, it is because heat has dissipated, leaving behind deficiency heat that causes itching; when this itching arises in the nose, it results in sneezing. If wind heat attacks upwards causing obstruction in the head and nose, with a floating pulse but no other symptoms, internal medicine affecting the nose can lead to sneezing, relieving the obstruction. If pain occurs during sneezing that becomes unbearable, it is because the air from the sneeze assaults and binds the pain, preventing it from being relieved.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>When the lung is harmonious, it can distinguish between aromas and odors.</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;True Words of the Golden Coffer&quot; states: In the West, there is white, which enters and connects to the lungs, opens the orifices at the nose, and stores essence in the lungs. Of the twelve meridians and three hundred sixty-five vessels, their qi and blood all ascend to the face and pass through the orifices. The essence and yang qi ascend to the eyes and become vision; the separate qi travels to the ears and becomes hearing; the ancestral qi exits through the nose and distinguishes odors. The &quot;Classic of Difficulties&quot; says: The lung qi connects to the nose; when the lung is harmonious, it can indeed distinguish between aromas and odors. The yang qi, or ancestral qi, is all derived from the qi generated in the stomach. Though their names differ, their principles are the same. If one is affected by hunger, satiety, or exertion, harming the spleen and stomach, the generated qi becomes weak, and the operant qi cannot ascend; thus, the obstructions impede the orifices, so the nose is not clear, and one cannot detect aromas or odors. Therefore, one should nourish the stomach qi to allow the yang qi and ancestral qi to rise, which will clear the nasal passages. </p>
<p>Moreover, another perspective from the &quot;Classic of Difficulties&quot; states: the heart governs the five odors, while the lung governs qi. Regarding the nose, it is the orifice of the lung that perceives aromas and odors. Why is that? It is because, when discussing orifices, we refer to the lung, while in terms of function, we refer to the heart. When the defensive qi is compromised and the cold pathogens invade the head and face, the nose is also affected, rendering it ineffective; thus, one cannot perceive aromas or odors. Therefore, the classics state that when the heart and lungs are ill, the nose is adversely affected. The ancient saying asserts: When sight and hearing are clear and refreshing, and aromas and odors can be distinguished and are warm, this is it. The treatment should first disperse the cold pathogenic factor, then replenish the defensive qi, allowing the qi of the heart and lungs to communicate; thus, the nose will become clear, and one will perceive aromas and odors. The Lize Tongqi Decoction is the main remedy for this.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>The lungs harbor evil and pathogen, combined with dryness and heat, causing nasal obstruction, sneezing, bleeding from the nose, and blood leakage. For those with a very dry and floating pulse, administer the Peach Kernel Purging Decoction; for those with a mild condition, use the Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction; for severe cases, the Resisting Decoction or the Resisting Pill for mild cases. The nose is an orifice of the lungs and becomes obstructed due to illnesses of the heart and lungs. There can be both cold and heat, which harm the skin and hair, leading to obstructed qi. When obstructed, the clear pathway is hindered, necessitating unblocking. For cold, treat the surface with herbs like Ephedra and Cinnamon Twig; for heat, clear it with herbs like Scutellaria, Coptis, and Fructus Gardeniae.</p>
<p><strong>Body belongs to the lungs, function belongs to the heart</strong></p>
<p>The classics state that the five qi enter through the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: the lungs govern the nose; when the nose is harmonious, it can discern fragrances and odors. As stated in &quot;Jiegugu,&quot; seeing and hearing are clear and refreshing, fragrances and odors are discerned and warm, which allows internal reception of heaven&#39;s qi to benefit the nine orifices. The orifice of the sanjiao opens at the throat and exits through the nose. The nose is the orifice of the lungs; this indicates the body. The ability to perceive fragrances and odors reflects its function. The heart governs the five odors and is situated in the nose; thus, all functions of the nine orifices draw upon life essence. The life essence of the heart is located in the You position, which corresponds to the lungs, so the nose is utilized by the heart to perceive fragrances and odors. Therefore, when the lungs are ill, the nose suffers obstruction. This indicates the clear qi is served by heaven while the heart is overexerted and the stomach weakened, leading to the reception of evil.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the face and nose become cold, they turn black.</p>
<p>All yang energy gathers in the head, making the face the utmost yang within yang. The nose sits at the center of the face, while the yang brightness originates from the mouth. The blood of the entire body flows to the face and nose, where the blood in the yang regions is exceedingly pure and refined. The nature of wine is to promote movement and is exuberantly warm but has a strong and acute toxicity. Those who consume much wine experience a vaporous intoxication; the blood from the wine becomes excessively hot, and when this hot blood is met with cold, it is attacked by yin energy, causing profuse sweat and stagnation of impurities, thus leading to a transition from purple to black. It is essential to dissolve the stagnant blood to allow for circulation and to generate new blood, which can then be processed, so that the illness may be cured. I create a medicinal formula combining the Four Substance Decoction with fried Mitreola, Poria, dried tangerine peel, fresh licorice, wine red flower, and ginger.

<p><strong>Diseases Related to the Lungs</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The nose is the external manifestation of the lungs. It is also said: In the west, the color white corresponds to the lungs and opens up to the nose. Furthermore, it is stated: When there is excess heat in the nose, it results in the discharge of turbid mucus. It is also noted that if the heart and lungs are ill, it is detrimental to the nose. According to &quot;Chao&#39;s Sources of Disease,&quot; it is said that the lungs open to the nose, and if heat invades the blood, then the qi is also heated. When both the blood and qi are heated, blood may be expelled from the nose, causing nasal bleeding, and if severe, it can lead to massive bleeding from the mouth and ears as well. Additionally, it is stated: When the lung organs are harmonized, the nasal qi flows smoothly, allowing one to discern scents. However, if evil influences invade the Taiyin, and their qi accumulates in the nose, then bodily fluids become blocked, preventing the nasal qi from circulating properly, which leads to an inability to discern scents and results in a foul condition. Finally, issues such as sores transforming into excess tissue, blockages, or runny noses are all due to the stagnation of pathogens in the lung meridian.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Illness Belongs to Fire</strong></p>
<p>The nose itches and air is expelled, resulting in a sneeze. Itching is caused by the transformation of fire; the heart&#39;s fire and pathogenic heat disturb the Yangming channel, leading to itching and sneezing in the nose. There are cases where one sneezes due to external disturbances and others who sneeze when looking at the sun; this is because the true fire of the sun shines upon the eyes, disturbing the heart, causing heat to rush upwards, resulting in itching and sneezing in the nose. </p>
<p>When wind-heat attacks upwards, causing congestion in the head and nose, or when pain follows sneezing, despite different symptoms, they are all manifestations of heat. Although the diseases may differ, the pathogenic heat invading the channels does not differ. Nasal congestion and itching are due to heat affecting the Yangming stomach channel. A runny nose, on the other hand, is due to heat affecting the Taiyin lung channel. </p>
<p>The nose is governed by the foot Yangming stomach channel, where the Yangming vessels intersect and lead to the nostrils. Furthermore, the nose is the orifice of the lungs, thus the lung qi communicates with the nose; the pathogenic heat affects both channels, manifesting as nasal congestion or runny nose.

<p>Nasal redness and bleeding are indicative of heat entering the lungs.</p>
<p>Nasal congestion is often seen in those who drink alcohol. The pathogenic heat from alcohol permeates the face and nose, causing blood heat and resulting in a runny nose that appears red. Additionally, some individuals may have a pre-existing wind-heat condition in the lung channels, which can also cause redness in the nose even without alcohol.</p>
<p>When nasal passages are not clear, treatment should involve dispersing with acrid and draining with bitter flavors.</p>
<p>Heat in the heart and lungs can obstruct the nose. This could be due to external wind-cold and internal heat causing congestion, preventing olfaction. Symptoms may include clear nasal discharge or itching leading to sneezing. Treatment should include acrid herbs such as Ephedra, Cinnamon Twig, Asarum, and Magnolia Flower to disperse. If the issue is solely due to internal heat without external factors, bitter herbs like Scutellaria, Coptis, and Gardenia should be used to drain.

Therefore, those who enjoy drinking hot liquor may initially injure the lung viscera, and prolonged heat will manifest externally as nasal congestion and a red tip of the nose. When heat intensifies, it turns red; when cold, it turns black. This indicates extreme heat, akin to water, which, when excessive, harms the nourishing aspect and requires moderation.

It may present as thick phlegm or a clear discharge, persisting over time, known as nasal flux; this indicates an external cold binding an internal heat condition.

<p>The right cun pulse is floating, surging, and rapid, indicating nasal bleeding and nasal congestion. The left cun pulse is floating and slow, suggesting a cold-related nasal blockage with clear nasal discharge. The nose is the gateway of the original female principle.</p>
<p>Laozi said: The Valley Spirit never dies, this is the original female. The gateway of the original female is the root of heaven and earth. It is ever-present but does not demand labor. What is the gateway of the original female? The answer: The nose connects to the qi of heaven, called the original gate; the mouth connects to the qi of the earth, called the female door. Thus, the nose is indeed the gateway of the original female.</p>
<p><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> [Ming □ Dai Sigong]</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>A blocked nose with continuous nasal discharge can have differing causes of cold and heat. Clear discharge indicates cold in the brain and lung, which should be treated with spices like xixin, wufu, and dried ginger. Turbid discharge, as mentioned in the &quot;Plain Questions,&quot; indicates that heat from the gallbladder has moved to the brain, resulting in nasal phlegm. One should use protective herbs, such as fangfeng and sweet chrysanthemum, and differentiate between the clear and the turbid regarding cold and heat. </p>
<p>If there is an excessive clear discharge not caused by cold injury, or if it is yellow, white, or occasionally mixed with blood resembling brain marrow, this arises from kidney deficiency. One should avoid excessive use of cold agents and instead use tonics like the Brain Supplement Powder, Black Tin Pill, Purple Spirit Pill, or Spirit Sand Pill. </p>
<p>If there is a cold or heat injury, leading to a blocked nose and significant discharge, a remedy to open the passages should be used.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Color Diagnosis</h3>
<p>If I am in good health, but the tip of the nose appears bluish-yellow, this person must have a type of urinary sickness; if the tip is slightly white, it indicates blood loss; if red, it signifies heat in the blood.</p>
<h3>Nasal Blockage</h3>
<p>The nasal passages are associated with the lungs, and the ability to sense smells is linked to the heart. When the body&#39;s water rises and fire descends, and the protective and nourishing energies are balanced, the nose facilitates the continuous exchange of breath. However, if cold damages the skin, the nose becomes blocked and functions poorly; if internal fire obstructs the clear channels, one cannot detect smells. For a recent onset of cold symptoms, with nasal blockage, heavy voice, runny nose, and sneezing, it is advisable to treat with remedies for wind and cold, such as modified Qiang Huo Decoction, Shen Su Drink, or Xiao Feng Bai Jie Powder. Over time, with slight exposure to wind and cold, nasal blockage and similar symptoms may arise due to lingering fire in the lungs; symptoms intensify with a preference for heat and aversion to cold, indicating internal fire manifesting from mild colds. It is best to use remedies that clear metal, descend fire, and facilitate air flow, like Liang Ge San with additions of Jing Jie and Bai Zhi, or Chuan Lian Shi Gao San. Additionally, if nasal blockage is persistent and dry in all seasons, with an inability to smell, one should use remedies to clear metal, reduce fire, and resolve phlegm, such as Qing Qi Hua Tan Wan or Shang Qing Wan. Traditional formulations for severe nasal blockage include Yu Han Decoction and Cheng Qie Wan; for inability to perceive smells, use Tong Qi Tang; in cases with hard obstructions, San Nan Xing Drink for nasal application, using external preparations of Bi Ba cake, and equal parts of Shi Chang Pu and Zao Jiao ground into powder, wrapped in cotton to block the nose while lying on the back for some time; for cases of deficiency and cold, use Tong Cao Wan.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>The nose is the pathway for the entrance and exit of clear air. Clear air is the vital energy produced within the stomach. If the nose is blocked for a prolonged period, the air becomes stagnant and unable to circulate, causing heat to accumulate in the brain, leading to a disorder of clear and turbid substances, resulting in nasal congestion, epistaxis, and deep congestion. Nasal congestion occurs when clear mucus flows from the nose, accompanied by slight heat. For this, prepare a formula of Er Chen Decoction with added herbs like Chuanxiong, Angelica, Xixin, Baizhi, Fangfeng, Qianghuo, and Juema, decocted with ginger and a little mint. If symptoms persist, use Zhi Yi Powder, adding mint, Jingjie, Huangqin, Shenchu, Banxia, and Nanshin, and take it after meals as a decoction, while also applying Xixin ointment externally.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nasal Morbidities</strong></p>
<p>Regarding nasal disorders, when there is a flow of turbid discharge from the nose, and the heat is intense, use Jinfei grass and increase the dosage of Huangqin. Add a piece of phoenix shell, burn it to retain its essence, and take it as a decoction. For lung wind, disperse the wind with &quot;Xiao Feng San,&quot; adding ash to enhance its effectiveness. If there is lung fire causing nasal discharge, cough with purulent or bloody sputum, use Jie geng decoction or Ren shen Ping lung powder. If there is heat from the gallbladder affecting the brain, leading to foul-smelling nasal discharge, apply &quot;Fang Feng Tong Sheng San&quot; with mint and Huanglian added, or use Zhi Yi powder. For external application, burn the stems and young shoots of Cang Er to ash, mix with vinegar, and apply inside the nose. Chronic nasal issues can lead to nosebleeds, and &quot;Fang Feng San&quot; is the primary remedy.</p>
<p><strong>Brain Silt</strong></p>
<p>For foul-smelling yellow discharge, it may lead to headaches or what is popularly known as brain silt. If there are worms affecting the brain, take a silk gourd vine near the root about five feet long, burn it to retain its essence, and grind it into powder mixed with wine. For deficiency issues, use Chuanwu powder; externally, take white ox tail hair and orange leaves equally ground and blow into the nose. If there is blood present, adding dried mountain gardenia is also beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Nasal congestion shows as redness at the tip, which can turn purple or black in severe cases. This occurs due to blood heat from drinking alcohol entering the lungs, compounded by wind cold; prolonged stagnation results in blood thickening and turning red. Those who do not drink may face lung wind and blood heat, suitable for Siyu San with Erchen Decoction, removing Banxia and adding Honghua and Huangqin. Boil the ingredients in water, add a small amount of wine, and mix with Wulingzhi powder for consumption. If there is Qi deficiency, add Huangqi, and regularly consume Danshan Zhi pills or Huanglian Ejiao pills. Occasionally use Shengma Heqi drink or swallow Qing pills to eliminate the root of the illness. For external application, use Huanglian powder, tian diao teng ash, adjusted with tung oil, or sulfur powder.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nasal Pain</strong></p>
<p>Nasal pain occurs when wind evils enter the nose, interacting with the body&#39;s vital energy, blocking the nasal passages, hence causing pain. Treatments include Huoxiang Zhengqi Powder and Qu Feng Tongqi Powder. If phlegm and heat disturb the lungs, there will be hidden pain in the nasal septum; in such cases, use Erchen Decoction combined with Huangqin, Shanzhi, Juye, and Maidong.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Sores</strong></p>
<p>Nasal sores can be minor or severe; the former is a simple nasal sore, while the latter is known as nasal hemorrhoids, both caused by lung heat. For sores inside the nose, brew loquat leaves, let it cool, then mix with Xiaofeng Powder and consume after meals. Avoid hot foods like fried ginger and garlic. Externally, use powdered Xinyi, mixed with a little bait and musk, to pack into the nose.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>Nasal hemorrhoids are caused by intense lung heat, which over time can congeal and form fleshy growths resembling jujubes, blocking the nasal passages. In severe cases, they are also known as nasal polyps. It is advisable to use Feng Tong Sheng San, adding Sanleng and haizao powder for consumption. Externally, use powdered Xinyi as the main ingredient, with a little Xixin and apricot seeds, mixed with sheep marrow and pig fat to make an ointment. Allow it to cool, then incorporate realgar, alum, and a little musk to form pills packed into the nose, which should be removed after a few days. In severe cases, a little nianshu may be added, or Guafang powder can also be effective. If heat and phlegm from food cause hemorrhoids, taking Cang&#39;er Wan internally and applying it externally will be most effective for digestion, or use two qian of alum, one qian of Xixin, and five fen of Baizhi, ground into powder to pack into the nose.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nasal conditions primarily require methods to disperse wind and clear heat. For those affected by wind-cold from the outside, treat with warmth to disperse. For wind-heat that has become trapped internally, either due to prolonged external exposure causing heat or from internal factors like excessive warmth from food and clothing, the heat generated by liver fire can cause nasal congestion and runny nose. It is advisable to clear heat and cleanse metal.</p>
<p>For prolonged conditions, nurturing blood and supplementing the kidneys is essential. If nasal discharge and congestion persist without improvement, it often indicates either a deficiency of heart blood or a lack of kidney water. Nourishing blood will generate vitality, thereby reducing heat, while supplementing the kidneys will elevate water levels to cleanse metal. This applies even for long-standing nasal sores or hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Additionally, persistent nasal congestion that does not improve must stem from internal damage to the lungs and stomach, which prevents the clear qi from rising and is not solely due to external factors. It is appropriate to use the formula &quot;Supplement the Middle and Benefit Qi&quot; for harmonization. This discussion focuses on the root treatment principles.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Outline</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Nasal congestion is associated with the lungs. The texts say: &quot;The lung qi connects to the nose; when the lung is harmonious, the nose can perceive smells.&quot; It is also said: &quot;The five qi enter the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs. If the heart and lungs are diseased, the nose will likewise suffer.&quot; Furthermore: &quot;The west is associated with the color white, which connects to the lungs, opens up the nasal orifices, and stores essence in the lungs.&quot; It is said: &quot;The lungs govern smell; within the organs, it is the lungs, and in the orifices, it is the nose.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Discharge</strong></p>
<p>When qi is disturbed, nasal discharge is also related to heat. The texts say: &quot;In the case of the Lesser Yin&#39;s recovery, if severe, it enters the lungs, causing cough and nasal discharge. It should be treated with bitter cold remedies.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Sneezing</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of nasal sneezing related to qi: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first is fire attack, caused by lung deficiency and results in nasal sneezing. The texts state: &quot;The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when hot qi descends and lung qi ascends, this leads to sneezing and nasal blockage.&quot; It is noted: &quot;The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; if hot excess prevails, people suffer from sneezing and vomiting.&quot; Furthermore: &quot;The Lesser Yang governs the heavens; when hot excess prevails, it can lead to severe sneezing.&quot; Additionally: &quot;In the recovery of the Lesser Yang, there is agitation with sneezing.&quot; It is said: &quot;The Lesser Yin governs the heavens; when external factors prevail, it leads to sneezing.&quot; Also: &quot;If the year’s metal does not balance, the fiery heat prevails, causing people to suffer from sneezing.&quot; It adds: &quot;When metal is imbalanced, it is called transformation; the condition leads to sneezing and coughing, which should be treated with various cold remedies.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second type is due to metal assistance, arising from lung fullness resulting in nasal sneezing. The text states: &quot;When the Yangming reaches its peak, sneezing occurs, and it should be treated with warming agents.&quot;<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ming Medical Miscellany</strong><br><strong>By Wang Lun</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nasal Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Nasal blockage prevents the perception of scents and odors. This may occur due to cold weather causing frequent obstruction, or slight exposure to wind and cold can lead to blockage. Many in society attribute this to lung cold and prescribe exterior-releasing and warming medicines, which are ineffective. However, they do not realize that this condition stems from excessive internal heat in the lung meridian, where the邪火 is quite strong, causing a preference for warmth and aversion to cold, resulting in blockage during cold encounters and symptoms upon exposure. The primary treatment should focus on clearing the lungs and reducing internal heat, supported by remedies that promote airflow. </p>
<p>For habitual nasal blockage where scents and odors are not perceived, further examination of the individual&#39;s usual condition is necessary. One should treat it as lung heat, clearing the metal element, dispelling heat, and resolving phlegm, potentially using pills that dissolve in the mouth or powdered medicines that can be taken lightly and over a long period, all of which have proven effective in my experience. </p>
<p>For instances of nasal obstruction arising suddenly without a prior history of blockage, often triggered by wind and cold, one should treat it as a wind-cold condition. </p>
<p><em>Note: If the obstruction is due to being overworked or issues with hunger and fullness, leading to weak stomach qi that cannot rise, it may impair the empty orifices, resulting in an inability to perceive scents. It is advisable to nourish the spleen and stomach to allow the yang qi to rise, which will clear the nasal passages. According to Dong Yuan, if bile heat moves to the brain, it can cause nasal issues, to be treated with Fengfeng Decoction. In general, much of this stems from disordered stomach qi.</em><a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Remarkable Remedies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The nose is the passageway to the lungs, governing the pathways for the intake and outflow of clear air. When the qi and blood are harmonized, and the yin and yang rise and fall appropriately, then breathing is smooth and the protective and nurturing energies circulate freely. When the nose is clear, one can sense both fragrance and odor. However, when the six excesses and seven emotions influence the body, alongside inner and outer injuries, as well as issues from diet and fatigue, the nasal qi can become obstructed, leading to a blockage in the clear pathways. </p>
<p>If there is accumulated heat in the yangming, it may force the blood to flow erratically, resulting in a condition known as epistaxis when it exits from the nostrils. Heat dries up the bodily fluids, while cold allows the brain&#39;s essence to flow down. Sometimes, wind and cold enter through the qi into the meridians, ascending to the brain and descending to the nose, resulting in an inability to contain the discharge, referred to as rhinorrhea. </p>
<p>If cold obstructs and blocks the nasal passages, one may be unable to detect fragrances or odors, resulting in nasal blockage. Prolonged stagnation of the blood vessels can lead to chronic entanglement and increasing obstruction, ultimately leading to the formation of nasal polyps. If qi becomes stagnant above, causing the evil heat to remain trapped, it results in nasal ulcers, which can eventually deteriorate into a more severe condition that produces foul-smelling discharge. In essence, the ailments of the nose are primarily due to wind and heat.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

It explains that nasal blockage can arise when fire energy is excessive, leading to swelling and heat affecting the nasal passages. The text clarifies misconceptions about cold causing nasal blockage, emphasizing that heat, especially in the Yang channels, can also lead to congestion. It mentions how the body positions and intersections of energy pathways influence nasal health, as well as how different organ systems (liver, heart, spleen, lung, kidney) express their heat through specific secretions like tears, sweat, saliva, and mucus. It concludes by noting that thick and turbid secretions result from intense heat, particularly when the gallbladder&#39;s heat affects the brain, leading to ongoing nasal discharge.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some say that a runny nose is due to cold in the lungs; they only see the nasal discharge and congestion worsening in cold conditions, leading them to this conclusion. Yet, they do not realize that cold damages the skin and hair, causing the pores to close tightly, which makes the trapped heat more painful. When a sneeze is hindered, it is due to itching within the nose causing a release of air that makes a sound. The nose is an opening to the lungs, and itching signifies a fire-like transformation. Evil heat from the heart interferes with the Yangming, manifests in the nose, and leads to sneezing. Some sneeze when an irritant disturbs their itch; this is linked to blood. Some sneeze when looking at the sun; this occurs because the eyes are the essence of the five organs, and the true fire of the sun dazzles the eyes, leading to agitation in the heart and rising heat, which causes itching in the nose and sneezing. In cases of cold damage resulting in weakness, sneezing occurs due to the retreat of heat, leaving residual heat that causes itching; the itch manifests in the nose, leading to a sneeze. In cases of wind-heat attacking upward, with congestion in the head and nose, a floating pulse without other signs, internal medicinals may help induce sneezing, thereby alleviating the congestion. There are cases where a sneeze causes unbearable pain; this pain arises because the force of sneezing attacks and disrupts blockages. All three manifestations pertain to heat. Thus, although the illnesses are different, the pathogenic heat affects various meridians differently.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nasal obstruction and itching are caused by heat affecting the Yangming Stomach meridian. Sneezing and nasal discharge arise from heat affecting the Taiyin Lung meridian. The nose is governed by the foot Yangming Stomach meridian, and the Yangming vessels intersect on both sides at the nostrils. The nose is also an orifice of the lungs, so the lung qi connects to the nose. When external heat obstructs the two meridians, it manifests in the nose as obstruction and discharge. Consequently, it is said that when the heart and lungs are ill, the nose suffers as a result. </p>
<p>The treatment depends on identifying the meridian affected by the pathogen. If symptoms worsen due to external wind and cold, and one erroneously treats it with warming remedies, they might temporarily improve. However, it’s important to understand that cold returning to heat can cause stagnant, turbid qi, obstructing the clear pathways, leading to these symptoms. If one uses spicy and sweet expelling herbs to open the pores and dispel stagnation, it will release the Yang heat. </p>
<p>For mild cases, this may suffice, but for more severe cases that are deeply obstructed, even if cooling and dispersing remedies are used, one may merely achieve temporary relief. The key lies in accurately assessing the severity of internal and external heat. Therefore, using appropriate spicy, warm, cool, or balanced medications is necessary. In all these cases, successful treatment relies on the physician&#39;s ability to recognize and address the illness effectively, ensuring complete healing.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Medical Principles: Six Essentials [by Ming Zhang Sanxi]</h3>
<h4>General Discussion</h4>
<p>It is commonly known that the lungs open to the nose. However, the Yangming channel intertwines with the nasal network and eyes, converging at Yingxiang, the point located five fen from each nostril. When wind pathogens enter through the face, they invade the Yangming channel, causing congestion and obstructing the flow of qi, which results in clear nasal discharge that may eventually turn turbid over time. This reflects the principle of external cold constraining internal heat, which is highly sensible. One must disperse it with pungent herbs. Formulas often employ Shengma, Gegen, Baizhi, and scallions as remedies associated with the Yangming meridian. When stagnation and heat persist, and one fails to resolve it, one must add cooling pungents like wine, Kuqin, and mint. If a wine drinker overindulges in rich, spicy, and hot foods, heat can rise, blocking the orifices, leading to nasal obstruction. This may manifest as thick nasal discharge, eventually causing symptoms like nasal dryness, nosebleeds, nasal polyps, and nasal hemorrhoids. This aligns with the passage in the &quot;Suwen&quot; about the gallbladder transferring heat to the brain.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Blocked and Unable to Breathe</strong></p>
<p>Nasal congestion during the cold months must be treated by adding ephedra and asarum to the Shengma and Gegen decoction, supplemented with croton and perilla leaves, and increasing the amount of licorice, with tangerine serving as a vehicle for success. If dispersion has occurred but not fully opened, with a strong pulse and dry mouth and nose, it should be treated with spicy and cool remedies such as wine-soaked codonopsis, gardenia, and mint. It is still necessary to include cautionary herbs like Xian, Fang, Sheng, and Zhi; avoid using cold and cooling methods hastily. </p>
<p>For those with qi deficiency, weak energy unable to rise results in nasal congestion. This is due to the nine orifices being unbeneficial, stemming from the digestive system. Taking nourishing remedies like the Baizhong Yiqi decoction regularly provides passage. This has been proven multiple times. </p>
<p>For obstruction of airflow and inability to smell or distinguish scents, the Tongcao powder is the primary remedy. </p>
<p>Phlegm-fire causing stagnation in the upper jiao, above the diaphragm, leads to closed orifices, resulting in the inability to smell or taste, or even deafness and blurred vision. This is primarily due to weak qi failing to ascend, allowing stagnant turbid qi to dominate; it is the deficiency that is fundamental and phlegm-fire that is symptomatic. One should use the Baizhong Yiqi decoction, add wind herbs like Sheng and Chai to facilitate upward flow, and also use pills for clearing and transforming phlegm and opening orifices. Careful dietary habits should be maintained, and over time, the condition will self-correct.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Yuan Zhi and Wine Stained Nose</strong></p>
<p>The fire in the upper burner is abundant, causing blocked qi and leading to nasal discharge; this is what the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; refers to as lung heat resulting in discharge. The prescription books mention that nasal discharge is due to phlegm seeping from the brain, which might not be accurate. Murky discharge is like a deep pool; the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states that heat from the gallbladder moves to the brain, resulting in a blocked nose. This is fundamentally caused by the lurking fire of the Yangming channel. It is advisable to take Feng Tong Sheng San, adding 2.5 grams each of mint and coptis, and decoct it in water for consumption. Alternatively, in the original formula, reduce the amount of realgar, talc, and gypsum by half, and double the amount of magnolia flower.</p>
<p>Nasal polyps must stem from accumulated heat in the upper burner, pent-up for a long time before manifesting externally.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Evidence for Treatment Guidelines [Ming, Wang Kentang]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Associated Meridians</strong></p>
<p>In the area of the nose and throat, &quot;throat&quot; can also be referred to as &quot;gau.&quot; The root of the nose is commonly called the &quot;bridge of the nose,&quot; associated with the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian and the meeting of the Governing Vessel. </p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: When the gallbladder transfers heat to the brain, it leads to nasal congestion and sudden nosebleeds, resulting in closed eyes. The note states that the Foot Taiyang Bladder Meridian originates at the inner corner of the eye, crosses at the forehead to connect to the brain, while the Yangming Meridian begins at the nose and converges in the throat area, alongside the Taiyang Meridian. Today, if there is heat in the brain, the Foot Taiyang and Yangming Meridians both become excessive and thin out at the throat, causing soreness in the nose and nasal congestion. Nasal congestion means mucus flows down continuously like a fountain. When heat is excessive, the Yang channels overflow, leading to nosebleeds, which is also called &quot;melt.&quot; If blood flows excessively, the Yangming and Taiyang Meridians weaken, failing to nourish the eyes, thus leading to closed eyes.] </p>
<p>The nose is associated with the Hand Taiyin Lung Meridian. </p>
<p>[Note: The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: In the western direction, the color white is related to the lungs and opens to the nose, being sensitive to heat. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: Those with lung illnesses experience wheezing and nasal enlargement. It also states: If the lungs are deficient, the nose becomes obstructed and unresponsive, but when balanced, one can discern scents. Qiao Yue states: If the lungs are completely deficient, there will be no nasal discharge, and the nostrils will be black and dry, with the liver&#39;s qi overwhelming it, leading to a bluish hue. Dong Yuan states: In case of a cold, the qi from the nose becomes coarse, making it hard to close the mouth, projecting qi upwards towards heaven.] </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Li Dongyuan noted that the nose primarily governs the lungs, and yet it has the ability to perceive both fragrance and odor, indicating that there is a vital essence within the nose, which is influenced by the Metal element born in the Snake year. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that the five energies enter the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs; if there are ailments in the heart and lungs, it will adversely affect the nose.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is associated with the hand and foot Yangming meridians, as well as the meeting point of the Governing Vessel. Liu Hejian remarked that if a cold wind injures the skin and causes nasal congestion, the cold can constrict and obstruct the flow of Yang energy. The &quot;Su Wen&quot; says that an attack of cold for two days affects the Yangming, which governs the flesh, and its meridian connects to the nose, resulting in nasal dryness that prevents sleep. Wang Haizang noted that gypsum induces sweating and the cooling nature enters the hand Taiyin meridian. Why did Zhongjing use it to treat Yangming syndrome caused by cold? Because the stomach meridian travels in front of the body, and the chest serves as a chamber for the stomach and lungs; when evil heat exists in Yangming, it constrains the lungs with fire, so a cooling agent is used to clear the lungs, thus it is called Baihu Decoction. Furthermore, the &quot;Su Wen&quot; states that the Yangming pathway leads to nasal sneezing; &quot;jiu&quot; refers to nasal obstruction, and &quot;ti&quot; refers to sneezing. </p>

Now, if one is subjected to the miasma of turbid air, which has built up over time, it leads to obstruction, stagnation, and the formation of phlegm and mucus. Conditions like hemorrhoids and polyp growths arise from prolonged accumulation, with internal dryness and heat kindling, while wind and cold compress from the outside, obstructing pathways and impeding the flow of qi and blood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment Methods for Nasal Congestion</strong></p>
<p>Tears and nasal discharge are related to the brain. Therefore, when brain fluid seeps out, it leads to thick nasal mucus. If the nasal discharge does not stop, it is like a spring of water, hence it is called nasal congestion. &quot;Forehead&quot; refers to the nose and the area above it. The foot Taiyang channel starts at the inner canthus of the eye, ascends to the forehead, crosses the crown, and enters the brain. The foot Yangming channel begins at the junction of the nose and upper face, near the Taiyang channel. When there is heat in the brain, the foot Taiyang is in a state of counterflow, and both the Taiyang and Yangming channels are strong. This excess leads to tenderness in the nose. With excessive heat, the Yang channels overflow, causing nosebleeds and sweating. If there is excessive bleeding, the Yangming and Taiyang channels weaken, failing to nourish the eyes, resulting in closed eyes. Reversal of qi is a symptom, and this condition arises from qi counterflow; therefore, it is advisable to take a decoction of Fangfeng. If there is phlegm and qi involved, a decoction of Nanzheng is recommended.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Nasal Disorders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nasal Congestion</strong><br>Nasal congestion belongs to the spleen, caused by stagnant heat in the blood that fails to disperse. It is said that what is within must manifest outside. It is advisable to use Zhenjun&#39;s Wonderful Plaster Powder, with added Baifuzi for application, and to take Loquat Leaf Pills and Huangqin Lung-Clearing Drink internally.</p>
<p><strong>Nasal Hemorrhoids</strong><br>Nasal hemorrhoids arise from unclear lung qi, with stagnation of wind and dampness. The nasal polyps, resembling pomegranate seeds, gradually enlarge and droop, blocking the nasal passages, preventing proper airflow. Internally, take Xin Yi Lung-Clearing Drink, and externally apply Nao Sha Powder daily until it gradually transforms into fluid and heals. Additionally, manage diet by avoiding rich foods, refrain from haste and excessive desires; after recovery, ensure that it does not recur.</p>
<p><strong>Cerebral Leakage</strong><br>Also known as nasal dripping, this condition results from wind and cold condensing in the brain cavity, coupled with damp heat. Symptoms include constant flow of thick nasal discharge, sometimes yellowish, dripping continuously and not drying up. Over time, it may result in dizziness and continuous weakness. Treat with Huoxiang Decoction as the main remedy, and Tianma Cake can also help in gradual recovery. If prolonged dizziness remains, take Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and Liu Wei Di Huang Pills alternately to nourish the essence and initially improve the condition.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Formula Study by Ming Dynasty Wu Kun</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Nasal Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The nose is located among the five sense organs; its illnesses are not about aesthetics. It is recorded: “If one exhausts decorative means, the practitioner will be far removed.” Therefore, we examine the five methods to treat the nose. </p>
<p>For those who have persistent nasal discharge, it is termed nasal obstruction. This is caused by wind-heat affecting the brain, damaging its vital energy. When the vital energy of the brain is unstable, fluids leak out on their own. The Cang Er San, composed of four ingredients, consists of all spicy and cooling items. The spicy elements can drive away wind, while the cooling components can disperse heat. Their light and clear nature allows them to penetrate to the crown. When the crown is clear, the brain fluids stabilize, and nasal obstruction can be cured.</p>
<p>When there are nasal polyps, causing breath to be obstructed and scents indiscernible, the main formula is the Xin Yi San. The nose is the gateway of breath; when the breath is clear, the nose is clear; when the breath is hot, the nose is blocked; and if the heat is severe, the blockage worsens—this is the reason for the growth of polyps. Therefore, treatment should focus on clearing the breath. This formula includes Xin Yi, Xi Xin, Chuan Xiong, Fang Feng, Gao Ben, Sheng Ma, and Bai Zhi, all being light, clear, spicy, and fragrant ingredients, which can clear the breath, eliminate heat, disperse evil, and open the passages.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The nature of Mugwort can facilitate communication within the body, while the gentleness of Licorice can help to clear heat. For nasal polyps, use a needle to make a slight prick, have the patient hold a mouthful of water, then mix melon seed powder with a small amount of musk, use a few drops of water to blow into the nose; this will help produce saliva and lead to healing. This bitterness can promote discharge, effectively helping to treat the polyps.</p>
<p>For those with Yang deficiency and coldness in the brain leading to nasal issues, the formula “Brain Supplement Powder” is indicated. The head is the upper part of the body, representative of Heaven’s Yang, thus all Yang energy converges in the face. If Yang energy is deficient, then Yin energy will gather, causing coldness in the brain and a runny nose. This formula includes Tian Xiong, which is hot and rising, and being hot it symbolizes the Sun, thus it can warm the brain and replenish Yang deficiency. Xin Yi and Cang Er herbs are both light and clear, acting as agents to help clear the brain, supporting Tian Xiong in this effort.</p>
<p>For a nose that is red like a pomegranate, use Da Huang powder, mixed with alcohol to apply externally. The nose signifies heat, and thus redness indicates blood. Da Huang, being cold, can help purge heat, while (Shibo) salt can help break down blood. This condition can often be found in those who indulge in alcohol, and if one does not stop drinking but merely relies on medication, it is like adding fuel to a fire—there is no benefit to the situation.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Evidence</strong></p>
<p>The nose is the passageway to the lungs and is also called the &#39;Yuan Pin.&#39; It is the pathway of the vital energy and the entrance to the heart and lungs; thus, the classics state that if there is disease in the heart and lungs, it negatively affects the nose. The meridians associated with it are exclusively related to Yangming; above the root of the nose, it connects with the Taiyang Governing Vessel, reaching the brain, which is why illnesses affecting these meridians can also impact the nose. In the case of illness, when there is obstruction it is called &quot;Jiu&quot; (nasal congestion). If it causes thick, foul-smelling mucus, it&#39;s referred to as &quot;Bi Yuan&quot; (nasal effusion), also called &quot;Brain Leakage.&quot; If there are growths blocking the airways, it is termed &quot;Bi Zhi&quot; (nasal polyps). Furthermore, conditions like sneezing, nosebleeds, sinusitis, and red nose must be diagnosed and treated accordingly. However, in summary, nasal diseases stem from two main sources: external influence of wind and cold, or internal heat rising. For external causes, the treatment should be to disperse with pungent herbs; for internal heat, it should be to clear and cool. Understanding these two factors will cover the main principles of treating nasal conditions.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treatment</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of nasal obstruction: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>For nasal obstruction caused by wind-cold, the cold closes the pores, leading to obstruction in the meridians and frequent sneezing. This condition often occurs in the Taiyang meridian and should be treated with pungent dispersing herbs to resolve the exterior. Formulas such as Chuanxiong San, Shen Yu San, as well as Ma Huang, Zi Su, Jing Jie, and green onion can be chosen for use.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the nasal obstruction is due to upward-ascending fire evil, it is necessary to clear the fire. When the fire is mild, it is often closer to the upper jiao, arising from the heart and lungs. One should use clearing and transforming drinks like Huangqin Zhi Mu Decoction. If the fire is severe, it usually stems from the Yangming stage and may be accompanied by a slight headache. In such cases, Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction or Liangge San can be employed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In cases of concurrent wind-cold and fire, one may also use formulas like Fangfeng Tongsheng San. Generally, persistent nasal obstruction is more related to fire, while sudden blockage is more often due to wind-cold; it is important to differentiate between the two.</p>
<p>Excess nasal discharge is often attributed to fire; thus, it is said that with severe lung heat, nasal discharge increases. From this perspective, excessive tearing or salivation without cause also indicates heat in the liver and spleen, as they belong to the same category.</p>
<p>The condition of nasal dripping is mainly due to the fire in the Taiyang and Du meridians; when severe, it connects to the brain, leading to continuous discharge, hence also known as &quot;brain leakage.&quot; This condition often arises from indulgence in alcohol, excessive fatty and sweet foods, prolonged use of hot substances, or fire being constrained by cold, resulting in damp-heat rising and causing fluids to overflow and degrade, with some discharges being foul-smelling and quite unbearable. In such cases, in the Hejian area, one may use Fangfeng Tongsheng San with an addition of peppermint and Huanglian, each two qian for treatment. Historically, Cang Er San has also been used for this condition.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, in my view, this fire rising in heat affects both the treatment of accompanying dryness and dispersing methods, leading to unsatisfactory results. It is better to simply clear the Yang fire while also nourishing the Yin; over time, this will bring tranquility. This is the method of suppressing the excessive. Therefore, one often adds five qian or one liang of white tribulus and two or three qian of cicada shells to a cleansing beverage. If the heat is severe, one can further adjust the dosage of cooling agents to effectively achieve complete recovery. Alternatively, using a decoction like Xuanming Fangfeng Tang is also acceptable. However, once this condition occurs, it is essential to regulate and treat it early; if left untreated for a long time, it becomes very difficult to remedy. </p>
<p>In cases of nasal or cerebral discharge, although they may be heat symptoms, if the discharge has persisted for a long time, the fire pathogen is already gone, but the discharge continues because the pathway is unable to seal properly. Therefore, new cases are often due to heat, while chronic cases may not necessarily all be heat symptoms. This must be carefully assessed in treatment; if one insists on using cold and cooling methods, it may inadvertently lead to the development of other illnesses.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

<p>Nasal polyps block the nasal passages; although the nose is an orifice of the lungs, this blockage in the patient is a disease of the meridians and muscles. This is actually due to the retention and stagnation of heat in the Yangming channel. Therefore, the internal treatment should focus on clearing fire and qi, while external treatment should utilize Huang Bai San, Qian Jin Polyp Decoction, Xiong Huang San, or simpler formulas for polyps.</p>
<p>For a red nose caused by excessive drinking, this often occurs in individuals who enjoy alcohol, leading to damp-heat invading and steaming the lungs, resulting in blood heat. Alternatively, some might develop red and black lesions from wind-heat in the lung channel.

<p>When the nose is swollen, it indicates excess fire in the lung meridian and is best treated with a sweet tangerine decoction. Now, if powdered soapberry is blown into the nose, and one sneezes numerous times, relief will be achieved. This is because the congestion in the nose will be released when one sneezes, allowing the obstructed energy to disperse, hence there is no need to clear the lungs for the nasal swelling to subside.</p>
<p><strong>Large Nose</strong></p>
<p>There are people whose noses are large like a fist, causing unbearable pain. This is due to the fire heat in the lung meridian being blocked in the nose and unable to discharge. The method is to clear the evil from the lungs and remove the fire in the nose. The prescription uses three qian (a unit of weight) each of Huangqin (Scutellaria), Maidong (Ophiopogon), flower pollen, and licorice; five qian each of Jiegang (Platycodon) and Tiandong (Asparagus); two qian of Zihuan (Aster); and one qian each of Baibu (Stemona) and Suye (Perilla leaf), decocted in water for consumption; four doses will resolve the issue.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Acupuncture for nasal congestion specifically targets the foot Taiyang meridian. According to the texts, the foot Taiyang is also known as Feiyang, located seven inches away from the ankle, and branches off to the Shaoyin. This is actually for treating nasal blockage and head pain, which is the main purpose of this technique. </p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: For moxibustion, the Yuhui point is directly above the nose, two inches into the hairline, about the size of a bean is the acupuncture point, to be moxibustion seven times. Additionally, at the Tongtian point, one inch on either side of Yuhui, moxibustion seven times. If there is foul odor in the left nostril, moxibustion on the left; if in the right, moxibustion on the right, applying the same treatment on both sides. I have used this method on several patients, and all had foul odor removed from the nose like decaying bones—unbearable smell, and their conditions were completely cured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Orthodox Surgical Texts&quot; details a secret method for treating nasal hemorrhoids. First, use fennel powder and blow into the nostrils twice. Then, take two fine copper chopsticks with a small hole drilled in one end, threading a silk string through. Maintain a gap of about five minutes between the ends of the chopsticks, inserting the ends directly onto the root of the nasal hemorrhoid. Twist the string tightly and pull down; the hemorrhoid will naturally come off. Place it in water to observe its size, and use powdered fetal hair and ivory mixed to blow into the nostrils; this will stop the bleeding. Avoid spicy foods.</p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue&quot; states that moxibustion at the Yuhui point seven times treats nasal issues and hemorrhoids. </p>
<p>For treating thick nasal discharge, apply moxibustion at the Shangxing point three times or seven times, and at the Tongtian point seven times; after moxibustion, nasal discharge will be expelled, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>For treating nasal obstruction and excessive mucus, apply moxibustion at Yingxiang, Renzhong, Dazhui, Hegu, Fengfu, Quchai, Baihui, and Fengchi; for foul nasal discharge, apply moxibustion three times and, if not effective, seven times.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a></p></div>

<p>In &quot;Records of Uncommon Oddities,&quot; it is said: Duke Di Liang was skilled in medicine, particularly in acupuncture. During the Xianqing period, he entered the borders as commanded, traveling through Huazhou, where the streets were filled with crowds. People gathered like a wall. Duke Di Liang pulled back the reins and observed from a distance a large board with big characters stating: &quot;Whoever can cure this child shall be rewarded with a thousand bolts of silk.&quot; Upon closer inspection, he saw a wealthy family&#39;s child, about fourteen or fifteen years old, lying beneath the board with a growth at the tip of his nose, as large as a fist, its base attached to the nose like the stem of food, causing severe pain when touched. His eyes were almost closed by the growth, the whites of his eyes showing as he writhed in agony, close to death. Compassionately pondering for some time, he then said: &quot;I can treat this.&quot; The child&#39;s parents and relatives bowed their heads in prayer, promptly offering a thousand bolts of silk set beside him. The Duke ordered them to help the child sit up, then inserted a needle about an inch behind the head, asking the patient: &quot;Has the needle&#39;s energy reached the afflicted area?&quot; The patient nodded. The Duke swiftly withdrew the needle and the growth fell off easily, instantly restoring the child&#39;s eyes to their original state without pain. The parents and family, weeping and bowing in gratitude, offered him silk as a gift. The Duke smiled and said: &quot;I grieve for the severity of your situation; I am merely a physician responding hastily to a dire need. I am not a performer of tricks.&quot; He disregarded their offerings and left.</p>
<p>In &quot;The Confucian Family and Respecting Parents,&quot; it is stated: Chang Zhongming often, during hot weather, exposed his skin to seek coolness, and was taken by the wind. He suffered nasal congestion for three days, despite sitting in a warm place, and was not relieved. A person recommended the use of Tongsheng Powder, which he cooked with fresh ginger, scallion roots, and fermented soybeans. After three servings, he sweated profusely, and his nose was immediately unblocked.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>

I said, “Abdominal distension and lack of appetite indicate a deficiency in the spleen and stomach; reduced urination indicates a deficiency in the lungs and kidneys; both are due to excessive attack.” I prescribed Liu Jun Zi, adding Huang Qi, Pao Jiang, and Wu Wei, and after two doses, all symptoms significantly diminished. I then used Bu Zhong Yi Qi with additional Pao Jiang and Wu Wei, and after several doses, he was completely cured.</p>
<p>For Minister Wang from the Workshop, who suffered from wheezing, coughing, thirst, a red face, and a dry nose, I believed there was heat in the spleen and lungs. I used Er Chen Decoction with additional Qin, Lian, Shan Zhi, Jie Geng, and Mai Dong, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>For County Magistrate Ruan, who had a white face and a runny nose, this indicated a deficiency in the spleen and lungs coupled with an external pathogen. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi with additional Fu Ling, Ban Xia, and Wu Wei, treating him until he recovered. Later, I used Liu Jun Zi and similar herbs for stabilization.</p>
<p>A man who had a white face and a runny nose, unable to smell any scents—pleasant or unpleasant—for three years, was treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi, adding Mai Dong and Shan Zhi, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A scholar, whenever he coughed, would use a remedy such as ginseng and perilla drink, and would recover. However, it recurred, and he used the same medication, resulting in a hoarse throat and a weak pulse on the left wrist. I assessed that the Yin fire of the kidney was harming and overcoming the lung metal, so I treated him with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, adding Mai Dong, Wu Wei, and roasted Shan Zhi, along with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In the first year of Wujing, when a person suffered from a cold with phlegm, he used medication to disperse the exterior and transform phlegm. With excessive phlegm causing coughing, his abdomen was distended, and his face was pale—indicative of a deficiency in the spleen that could not generate lung metal. I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Jie Geng, and he immediately recovered. After three days, the previous symptoms reappeared, with a clear nasal discharge, indicating a recurrence of a cold. I used the previous medication, adding Sang Pi and Xing Ren, as well as Jie Geng, and he recovered.</p>
<p>Zhong Suzi from Changzhou had an abscess on his nose, belonging to superficial pathogenic factors, but both his qi and blood were deficient, preventing the dispersal. So, I primarily used Bu Zhong Yi Qi, supporting it with Fang Feng and Bai Zhi, and he recovered.</p>
<p>In &quot;Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng,&quot; it is said that Sun&#39;s aunt had not smelled any scents for many years. Later, due to another illness, her friend Miao Zhongchun prescribed a formula, using Sang Bai Pi in amounts of seven to eight qian; after taking it for some time, her nasal congestion unexpectedly resolved.</p>
<p>In &quot;Han Shi Yi Tong,&quot; it is recorded that a nobleman had a fleshy growth in his nose, emitting an unbearable odor and causing pain upon any movement, leaving him helpless. I simply used a bit of powdered alum mixed with a small amount of Nao Sha, blowing it into the nostrils, and shortly thereafter it transformed into water and disappeared. Along with this, I applied Sheng Shi Tang combined with Xie Bai San in two doses, and he was cured. This was due to thick flavors obstructing, with damp heat steaming at the lung entrance, akin to mushrooms suddenly sprouting after the rain clears.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

(Notes: The western direction is associated with metal, represented by the color white. The lungs are classified as a metal organ, with the nose being their orifice.) In spring, it is common to suffer from nasal bleeding. (Notes: \"Common\" refers to the external conditions affecting the five organ channels; when wind harms the muscle layers, it can easily enter the channels. Nasal bleeding is a symptom relating to the head and face. Spring is a time when energy is abundant in the head, thus leading to a higher incidence of nasal bleeding.) Additionally, it is stated: In winter, do not press on the knees; in spring, do not have nasal bleeding. (Notes: Pressing on the knees refers to massage and guiding techniques to promote the flow of yang energy in the limbs. In winter, yang energy remains stored; if one forces it to move outward, it cannot generate the vital energy of spring, resulting in nasal bleeding.) **Discussion of the Correspondence of Yin and Yang** The lungs govern the nose. (Notes: The lung energy connects to the nose, and when lung function is harmonious, the nose can discern aromas. Thus, the lungs are in charge of the orifice at the nose.) **Separate Discussion of the Five Organs** The five energies enter through the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs. When the heart and lungs are ill, the nose suffers as a consequence. (Notes: The heart and lungs, positioned above, represent yang; the lungs cover the heart and govern qi, opening to the nose. Therefore, when they are diseased, it negatively affects the nose.)"},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"### Hot Discussion In the case of cold damage lasting two days, the Yangming channel is affected. Yangming governs the flesh, and its meridian connects the nose and eyes; hence there is body heat, eye pain, and a dry nose that prevents sleep. [Note: The energy of Yangming governs the muscles and flesh. Body heat indicates the illness of Yangming energy. Although the disease is in the energy, the Yangming meridian connects the nose and eyes and is associated with the stomach, hence the symptoms of eye pain and dry nose. The stomach is not harmonious, thus sleep is unattainable.] ### Needle Hot Discussion For those with spleen heat disease, the nose is red at the tip. [Note: The Earth is situated in the center, hence the red tip of the nose.] ### Needle Method Discussion When evil energy invades the foot Yangming channel, it causes sneezing and nasal bleeding. [The foot Yangming meridian rises from the nose; when evil energy invades it, it leads to sneezing and nasal bleeding.] ### Discussion on Qi Stagnation When heat from the gallbladder moves to the brain, it results in nasal congestion. Nasal congestion is defined as continuous discharge of turbid nasal mucus. This can lead to bleeding. [Note: When the gallbladder energy rises, heat enters the brain. The areas beside the nose are referred to as \"nape.\" The term indicates the nose's nape is pungent and sour. Nasal congestion refers to the continuous discharge of turbid mucus. The brain is the sea of essence and marrow; marrow fills the bones, and the brain is Yin, so when the brain becomes congested, this produces mucus. Yang Yuanru stated: The kidneys govern the storage of essence and reside below, while the brain is the sea of essence and marrow situated above; the gallbladder is the storehouse of central essence. All three govern the storage of essence and are interconnected, hence the bile evil can enter the brain.

When the year of Metal does not reach [its peak], the people suffer from sneezing and nasal congestion. (Note: Sneezing is associated with lung diseases.) **On Pulse Resolution** The Yangming, known as the guest Sun pulse, leads to headache, nasal congestion, and abdominal distention. The Yangming combines with the upper: thus, the Sun connects with the Taiyin. Therefore, headaches, nasal congestion, and abdominal distention occur. (Note: The movement of Yin and Yang qi rises and falls, entering and exiting, circulating in the qi space outside the pulse. The qi space exists between the skin and muscles. The 'upper' refers to the skin. The superficial pulses, which are commonly observed, are all connected vessels. The pulse of the Foot Taiyin is also found at the skin's surface and is not hidden; therefore, the qi of Yangming converges at the top, pressing against the Sun network, and with the Taiyin meridians. Pressing against the Yangming Sun network causes headaches and nasal congestion, while pressing against the Taiyin meridian leads to abdominal distention.) **On the Essential Great Theory** The Great Yang governs the heavens, and the people suffer from sneezing and nosebleeds. (Note: The sneezing and nosebleeds are indicative of excessive Yang heat.) In the Lesser Yin's resurgence, there is agitation, sneezing, and if severe, it enters the lungs, leading to coughing and nasal discharge.

Shaoyang controls the sky; when fire Qi descends, lung Qi ascends, leading to coughs, sneezing, nasal bleeding, and nasal congestion. **Notes:** The ascent of lung Qi corresponds to the descending Qi of the sky, fearing its dominance, thus it follows suit. Coughs, sneezing, nasal bleeding, and nasal congestion are all lung disorders. Taiyang (Greater Yang) controls the sky; when cold Qi descends, heart Qi ascends, leading to coughs and a propensity for sadness. **Notes:** When cold Qi descends, the stored Qi ascends. Fire nature rises, while water nature descends. When fire Qi trends upward, frost and cold recompose it. Coughs and sneezing show a tendency for sadness, as fire heats and transforms. Shaoyin (Lesser Yin) controls the sky; when heat Qi descends, lung Qi ascends, resulting in sneezing, nasal bleeding, and nasal congestion. Yangming (Bright Yang) controls the sky; in its initial phase, people suffer from nasal bleeding, sneezing, yawning, and vomiting. **Notes:** Nasal bleeding, sneezing, yawning, and vomiting relate to the Qi of wind and wood.

The foot Yangming meridian of the stomach begins at the intersection of the nose and jaw and descends following the outer side of the nose. The illness it causes is nasal bleeding. [Note: All of these conditions arise from the pathways followed by the meridians.] ### Oral Inquiry Chapter The mouth and nose are the gateways of qi. [Note: The mouth, nose, ears, and eyes are all cavities; hence, it is said that the mouth and nose are the gateways of qi.] ### Master’s Transmission Chapter The nasal passage extends long to correspond with the large intestine. The nostrils are external, allowing the bladder to leak. [Note: The nose is the opening of the lungs, and the large intestine is the organ of the lungs, thus the nose corresponds with the large intestine. The bladder is the organ responsible for fluids; when qi transforms, it is released, and when the air from the nostrils is expelled, it indicates the bladder is leaking, showing that the upper openings connect and the lower openings discharge.] ### Five Observations and Five Agents Chapter The nose is the official of the lungs.

In the fortieth difficulty, it is said: \"The lung governs voice, and the nose, as a reflection of the lung, is able to sense scents; what is the reasoning behind this?\" Indeed, the lung represents the metal of the western direction. Metal is born during the time of the Si (Snake), which corresponds to the southern fire; this fire represents the heart. The heart governs odors, thus allowing the nose to discern scents. **[Note: The lung is metal. Voice emanates from metal, hence the lung governs voice. The heart is fire; the transformation of fire produces the five odors, thus the heart governs odors. The lung governs voice, and though the nose belongs to the lung, if it cannot perceive sound, how can it discern scents? The reason lies in the lung's association with metal. Metal thrives during the Si hour, in the southern positions of Si, Wu, and Wei. Si is the place where fire is administratively situated and in the organs corresponds to the heart, which governs odors. Though the nose belongs to the lung, the lung, as metal, is born from the position of heart fire, allowing the nose to discern scents.]**"},{"anchor":"trans-8p","marker":"8p","type":"translation","text":"**Jinkui Yaolue (Essential Prescriptions of the Gold Coffer) by Han Zhang Ji** **Nasal Congestion with Clear Nasal Discharge** Lung abscess, chest fullness and distension, swelling of the whole body and face, nasal congestion with clear discharge, inability to perceive scents or tastes, cough with reversed qi, wheezing, and blocked breathing are treated with the Tsing Li Da Zao Xie Lung Decoction. **Dry Nose** In cases of alcoholic jaundice, there may be no fever, clear speech, fullness in the abdomen, and a dry nose. If the pulse is floating, induce vomiting first; if it is deep and taut, use purgation first. **Zhong Cang Jing (Classic of Internal Storage) by Han Hua Tuo** **Inability to Smell and Constant Clear Nasal Discharge** In lung wind conditions, there is fullness in the chest, unintentional sweating, inability to smell scents, and wheezing that prevents lying down, which can be treated. If the lung is full, there will be clear discharge from the nose. **Death Color** If the lung is deceased, the nostrils will open and turn black, with the black color starting at the nose and gradually moving to the mouth, indicating death.

However, if the seven emotions are repressed internally, and the six external pathogens harm it, dietary factors and labor may prevent the nasal energy from venting and regulating, leading to blockages in the clear pathways. The resulting ailments include: nosebleeds, boils, nasal polyps, ulcers, clear nasal discharge, blockage and congestion, impurities, or the inability to perceive scents. All these arise from imbalances in the lungs, with pathogenic energy accumulating in the nose and obstructing the clear pathways. For treatment, if it is cold, warm it; if it is hot, clear it; if it is blocked, unblock it; if it is congested, disperse it—nothing must be overstepped beyond this principle. However, in the case of an epistaxis induced by environmental factors, it should not be hastily stopped; if the bleeding exceeds three 'sheng' (a measure), one may consider intervention. As mentioned in the \"Book of Living\" concerning nosebleeds, they are a release, largely due to an excess of Yang energy. This is something one must be aware of. The nose governs the lungs, serving the functions of purification and adjustment. When these functions are performed properly, the lungs will be unimpeded, and the clear pathways will be of benefit. If there's an improper method of nourishment, the clear pathways become obstructed, resulting in nasal ailments. The lungs are related to air, while the liver is related to blood. When these are harmed by pathogenic heat, the blood becomes mature; when the blood heats, the air also heats, causing both blood and air to become hot and rise rebelliously, leading to nosebleeds, and potentially sores in severe cases. If wind and cold invade, obstructing the Yang channels, congestion can occur, resulting in clear discharge. If this accumulation does not disperse, one will lose the ability to sense scents, leading to nasal congestion, or possibly nasal pain due to polyps. Additionally, if heat flows into the bile, and the pathogens move to the brain, it can result in nasal obstruction. Nasal obstruction, in this context, is characterized by continuous discharge of muddy mucus. It is said to cause dizziness and is thus attributed to deficient energy."},{"anchor":"trans-10p","marker":"10p","type":"translation","text":"**Abscess and Ulcer Compendium** 【Jin □ Dou Hanqing】 **Nasal Polyp (Nasal Hemorrhoid)** The nose is located in the center of the face, functioning as a passage for the blood circulation of the entire body, and the nostrils connect to the lungs. Its energy ascends to the brain and descends to the lungs. When the lung energy is clear and the flow of qi and blood is unobstructed, no diseases arise. However, when the lung energy is abundant and there is any blockage, various diseases will develop. The nasal polyp, known as nasal hemorrhoid, arises from the influence of the six external factors and seven emotions. If it grows upwards and enters the eyes, it is called pinguecula. If it grows downwards and enters the nasal cavity, it is called nasal polyp. When there is obstruction and blockage, one should avoid alcohol and control desires, eliminate worries, and refrain from sadness. Take decoctions internally and apply topical medicines externally, in hopes of restoring balance."},{"anchor":"trans-11p","marker":"11p","type":"translation","text":"**Hejian Six Writings** (by Liu Wansuo) **Drying of the Nose** When the nostrils are dry, it is the essence of metal in the lungs. The lungs store qi, and if the blood is depleted internally, qi becomes deficient or is affected by wind, resulting in dryness. Wind can overcome dampness, and heat can consume fluids; both can lead to dryness. Hence, the classics say that wind, heat, and fire are all yang, while cold, dampness, and dryness belong to yin. Additionally, although dry dampness is different, the dryness of metal, though associated with the autumn yin, is distinctly different from cold dampness. Dryness is more prominent with wind, heat, and fire; thus, when wind and heat are severe, they can also coincide with dryness from cold and dampness. Therefore, when cold results in vomiting and diarrhea, causing a loss of fluids leading to dryness, it follows this principle. The classics state that all symptoms of withering and dryness are related to dryness. Concerning the symptoms of cold damage, one may experience pain in the head and neck, stiffness in the lower back and spine, a rigid body, surface heat with aversion to cold, no restlessness, no spontaneous sweating, or may have headaches, muscle warmth, nasal dryness, or chest fullness with wheezing, fingertips feeling slightly cold, and a pulse that is floating, rapid, and tight. These indicate that pathogenic heat is at the surface, aligning with the symptoms treated by Ma Huang Decoction, or similar formulas such as Tian Shui San. **Nasal Congestion** Heat transferred from the gallbladder to the brain results in painful, dry nasal congestion, with continuous thick discharge, flowing like a spring without interruption, persisting for a long time and potentially causing nosebleeds. Fang Feng Decoction is the primary treatment for it."},{"anchor":"trans-12p","marker":"12p","type":"translation","text":"**Nasal Discharge** Nasal discharge is when clear mucus comes from the nose. The principles of the five elements dictate that when something is mild, it corresponds to its original transformation, but when it is extreme, it can involve supernatural forces. Thus, it is said: when the yang is excessive, it harms the body’s ability to control. The Book of Changes states: the element that dries out all things the most is fire. Fire refines metal; when it reaches extreme heat, it transforms into water, and when the body reaches extreme heat, it manifests as sweat. Water is inherently gentle, and when it is extremely cold, it can turn into ice like the earth; the earth itself governs moisture and brings forth clouds and rain, and when it becomes overly moist, it can cause violent storms. Wood represents warmth and fosters growth, but strong winds can make it cold and cause breaking. Metal represents coolness; when autumn coolness reaches its peak, all things can become dry. All of these illustrate that when something is pushed to extremes, it can turn into supernatural disturbances, which is a counteraction to its excess. Hence, when liver heat becomes excessive, tears are produced; when heart heat is excessive, it results in sweat; when spleen heat is excessive, it generates saliva; when lung heat is excessive, it leads to nasal discharge; and when kidney heat is excessive, it results in spittle. The texts say: heat in the nose results in turbid nasal discharge. All phlegm, saliva, nasal discharge, and spittle that are thick and turbid indicate extreme fire heat, leading to a melting effect. Some mistakenly say that nasal discharge is due to lung cold; they only observe the discharge and sneezing that occur with cold exposure and conclude hastily, not realizing that cold damages the skin and fur, causing the pores to close tightly, leading to exacerbated conditions due to extreme heat and stagnation. When pressing the lower abdomen, if there is inner pain as if water were being poured, a deficiency might manifest in urination, leading to clear nasal discharge. The sun moves directly down from the top into the channels of the brain, with energy flowing down to the nose, resulting in incessant clear nasal discharge."},{"anchor":"trans-13p","marker":"13p","type":"translation","text":"Nasal Congestion Nasal congestion refers to blockage and obstruction. Fire, which governs (the facial region), swells and inflates, causing heat to invade the Yangming channel and resulting in swelling in the nose, leading to obstruction. Some argue that cold governs closure and mistakenly attribute nasal congestion to cold, which is erroneous. The essence is that when Yang energy is abundant above and one lies on their side, the upper orifices become open and clear, while the lower orifices can become blocked. This is because the channels of Yangming intersect on the left and right, with the left channel entering the right orifice and the right channel entering the left orifice. Therefore, if wind-heat accumulates and the affliction is biased towards the left, the right orifice becomes blocked in response. Common understanding does not recognize that the channels of Yangming intersect and lead to the nostrils. They see lying on one's side resulting in open upper orifices and blocked lower orifices, and mistakenly suspect it is cold. Thus, the path of negation reveals the oscillation of lung metal (Qi) in rise and fall."},{"anchor":"trans-14p","marker":"14p","type":"translation","text":"### Disease Manifestations Spleen WIND causes a yellow nose, Spleen HEAT causes a red nose. ### Sneezing Sneezing occurs when the nose itches, causing air to expel with sound. The nose is the orifice of the lungs, and itching is a transformation of fire. When heart fire, an evil heat, disturbs the Yangming, it manifests in the nose leading to itching, hence the sneeze. Sometimes, when external irritants cause itching and result in sneezing, it is due to this itch being associated with fire. If one sneezes upon looking at the sun, it is because the eyes are the spiritual essence of the five organs; true solar fire from sunlight shines on the eyes, causing the heart spirit to become agitated and generating heat upwards, thus leading to nasal itching and sneezing. In cases where a cold illness has progressed and one sneezes, it is because heat has dissipated, leaving behind deficiency heat that causes itching; when this itching arises in the nose, it results in sneezing. If wind heat attacks upwards causing obstruction in the head and nose, with a floating pulse but no other symptoms, internal medicine affecting the nose can lead to sneezing, relieving the obstruction. If pain occurs during sneezing that becomes unbearable, it is because the air from the sneeze assaults and binds the pain, preventing it from being relieved."},{"anchor":"trans-15p","marker":"15p","type":"translation","text":"**Ten Books of the Eastern Garden** ***Li Gao of the Yuan Dynasty*** **When the lung is harmonious, it can distinguish between aromas and odors.** The \"True Words of the Golden Coffer\" states: In the West, there is white, which enters and connects to the lungs, opens the orifices at the nose, and stores essence in the lungs. Of the twelve meridians and three hundred sixty-five vessels, their qi and blood all ascend to the face and pass through the orifices. The essence and yang qi ascend to the eyes and become vision; the separate qi travels to the ears and becomes hearing; the ancestral qi exits through the nose and distinguishes odors. The \"Classic of Difficulties\" says: The lung qi connects to the nose; when the lung is harmonious, it can indeed distinguish between aromas and odors. The yang qi, or ancestral qi, is all derived from the qi generated in the stomach. Though their names differ, their principles are the same. If one is affected by hunger, satiety, or exertion, harming the spleen and stomach, the generated qi becomes weak, and the operant qi cannot ascend; thus, the obstructions impede the orifices, so the nose is not clear, and one cannot detect aromas or odors. Therefore, one should nourish the stomach qi to allow the yang qi and ancestral qi to rise, which will clear the nasal passages. Moreover, another perspective from the \"Classic of Difficulties\" states: the heart governs the five odors, while the lung governs qi. Regarding the nose, it is the orifice of the lung that perceives aromas and odors. Why is that? It is because, when discussing orifices, we refer to the lung, while in terms of function, we refer to the heart. When the defensive qi is compromised and the cold pathogens invade the head and face, the nose is also affected, rendering it ineffective; thus, one cannot perceive aromas or odors. Therefore, the classics state that when the heart and lungs are ill, the nose is adversely affected. The ancient saying asserts: When sight and hearing are clear and refreshing, and aromas and odors can be distinguished and are warm, this is it. The treatment should first disperse the cold pathogenic factor, then replenish the defensive qi, allowing the qi of the heart and lungs to communicate; thus, the nose will become clear, and one will perceive aromas and odors. The Lize Tongqi Decoction is the main remedy for this."},{"anchor":"trans-16p","marker":"16p","type":"translation","text":"**Flowing Clear Mucus** In the third month of winter, the Yin energy is outside, while the Yang energy is stored within.

Midwinter is the time when Water is vigorous; with strong Water, Metal grows strong, where the child can make the mother fruitful. The lungs are the mother of the kidneys, and the original Yang of the skin and hair is inherently weak. When aided by winter, those who are ill may frequently sneeze, have a runny nose with clear mucus, and when the cold is severe, they may produce turbid mucus. Sneezing does not stop; they are more severely affected by wind and cold than usual, experience frequent and insufficient urination, or may notice their urine is clear and abundant. Their bowel movements may be irregular; they suffer from cold at night and sleeplessness. In severe cases, this may lead to phlegm cough, vomiting, foulness, throwing up, or spitting white foam, progressing to the mouth opening, eyes bulging, and breath not circulating, nearly leading to collapse.

For those with a very dry and floating pulse, administer the Peach Kernel Purging Decoction; for those with a mild condition, use the Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction; for severe cases, the Resisting Decoction or the Resisting Pill for mild cases. The nose is an orifice of the lungs and becomes obstructed due to illnesses of the heart and lungs. There can be both cold and heat, which harm the skin and hair, leading to obstructed qi. When obstructed, the clear pathway is hindered, necessitating unblocking. For cold, treat the surface with herbs like Ephedra and Cinnamon Twig; for heat, clear it with herbs like Scutellaria, Coptis, and Fructus Gardeniae. **Body belongs to the lungs, function belongs to the heart** The classics state that the five qi enter through the nose and are stored in the heart and lungs. The \"Nanjing\" states: the lungs govern the nose; when the nose is harmonious, it can discern fragrances and odors.

It is recorded: “If one exhausts decorative means, the practitioner will be far removed.” Therefore, we examine the five methods to treat the nose. For those who have persistent nasal discharge, it is termed nasal obstruction. This is caused by wind-heat affecting the brain, damaging its vital energy. When the vital energy of the brain is unstable, fluids leak out on their own. The Cang Er San, composed of four ingredients, consists of all spicy and cooling items. The spicy elements can drive away wind, while the cooling components can disperse heat. Their light and clear nature allows them to penetrate to the crown. When the crown is clear, the brain fluids stabilize, and nasal obstruction can be cured. When there are nasal polyps, causing breath to be obstructed and scents indiscernible, the main formula is the Xin Yi San. The nose is the gateway of breath; when the breath is clear, the nose is clear; when the breath is hot, the nose is blocked; and if the heat is severe, the blockage worsens—this is the reason for the growth of polyps. Therefore, treatment should focus on clearing the breath. This formula includes Xin Yi, Xi Xin, Chuan Xiong, Fang Feng, Gao Ben, Sheng Ma, and Bai Zhi, all being light, clear, spicy, and fragrant ingredients, which can clear the breath, eliminate heat, disperse evil, and open the passages."},{"anchor":"trans-48p","marker":"48p","type":"translation","text":"The nature of Mugwort can facilitate communication within the body, while the gentleness of Licorice can help to clear heat. For nasal polyps, use a needle to make a slight prick, have the patient hold a mouthful of water, then mix melon seed powder with a small amount of musk, use a few drops of water to blow into the nose; this will help produce saliva and lead to healing. This bitterness can promote discharge, effectively helping to treat the polyps. For those with Yang deficiency and coldness in the brain leading to nasal issues, the formula “Brain Supplement Powder” is indicated. The head is the upper part of the body, representative of Heaven’s Yang, thus all Yang energy converges in the face. If Yang energy is deficient, then Yin energy will gather, causing coldness in the brain and a runny nose. This formula includes Tian Xiong, which is hot and rising, and being hot it symbolizes the Sun, thus it can warm the brain and replenish Yang deficiency. Xin Yi and Cang Er herbs are both light and clear, acting as agents to help clear the brain, supporting Tian Xiong in this effort. For a nose that is red like a pomegranate, use Da Huang powder, mixed with alcohol to apply externally. The nose signifies heat, and thus redness indicates blood. Da Huang, being cold, can help purge heat, while (Shibo) salt can help break down blood. This condition can often be found in those who indulge in alcohol, and if one does not stop drinking but merely relies on medication, it is like adding fuel to a fire—there is no benefit to the situation."},{"anchor":"trans-49p","marker":"49p","type":"translation","text":"**Discussion on Evidence** The nose is the passageway to the lungs and is also called the 'Yuan Pin.' It is the pathway of the vital energy and the entrance to the heart and lungs; thus, the classics state that if there is disease in the heart and lungs, it negatively affects the nose. The meridians associated with it are exclusively related to Yangming; above the root of the nose, it connects with the Taiyang Governing Vessel, reaching the brain, which is why illnesses affecting these meridians can also impact the nose. In the case of illness, when there is obstruction it is called \"Jiu\" (nasal congestion). If it causes thick, foul-smelling mucus, it's referred to as \"Bi Yuan\" (nasal effusion), also called \"Brain Leakage.\" If there are growths blocking the airways, it is termed \"Bi Zhi\" (nasal polyps). Furthermore, conditions like sneezing, nosebleeds, sinusitis, and red nose must be diagnosed and treated accordingly. However, in summary, nasal diseases stem from two main sources: external influence of wind and cold, or internal heat rising. For external causes, the treatment should be to disperse with pungent herbs; for internal heat, it should be to clear and cool. Understanding these two factors will cover the main principles of treating nasal conditions."},{"anchor":"trans-50p","marker":"50p","type":"translation","text":"**On Treatment** There are two types of nasal obstruction: 1. For nasal obstruction caused by wind-cold, the cold closes the pores, leading to obstruction in the meridians and frequent sneezing. This condition often occurs in the Taiyang meridian and should be treated with pungent dispersing herbs to resolve the exterior. Formulas such as Chuanxiong San, Shen Yu San, as well as Ma Huang, Zi Su, Jing Jie, and green onion can be chosen for use. 2. If the nasal obstruction is due to upward-ascending fire evil, it is necessary to clear the fire. When the fire is mild, it is often closer to the upper jiao, arising from the heart and lungs. One should use clearing and transforming drinks like Huangqin Zhi Mu Decoction. If the fire is severe, it usually stems from the Yangming stage and may be accompanied by a slight headache. In such cases, Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction or Liangge San can be employed. In cases of concurrent wind-cold and fire, one may also use formulas like Fangfeng Tongsheng San. Generally, persistent nasal obstruction is more related to fire, while sudden blockage is more often due to wind-cold; it is important to differentiate between the two. Excess nasal discharge is often attributed to fire; thus, it is said that with severe lung heat, nasal discharge increases. From this perspective, excessive tearing or salivation without cause also indicates heat in the liver and spleen, as they belong to the same category. The condition of nasal dripping is mainly due to the fire in the Taiyang and Du meridians; when severe, it connects to the brain, leading to continuous discharge, hence also known as \"brain leakage.\" This condition often arises from indulgence in alcohol, excessive fatty and sweet foods, prolonged use of hot substances, or fire being constrained by cold, resulting in damp-heat rising and causing fluids to overflow and degrade, with some discharges being foul-smelling and quite unbearable. In such cases, in the Hejian area, one may use Fangfeng Tongsheng San with an addition of peppermint and Huanglian, each two qian for treatment. Historically, Cang Er San has also been used for this condition."},{"anchor":"trans-51p","marker":"51p","type":"translation","text":"However, in my view, this fire rising in heat affects both the treatment of accompanying dryness and dispersing methods, leading to unsatisfactory results.

Therefore, one often adds five qian or one liang of white tribulus and two or three qian of cicada shells to a cleansing beverage. If the heat is severe, one can further adjust the dosage of cooling agents to effectively achieve complete recovery. Alternatively, using a decoction like Xuanming Fangfeng Tang is also acceptable. However, once this condition occurs, it is essential to regulate and treat it early; if left untreated for a long time, it becomes very difficult to remedy. In cases of nasal or cerebral discharge, although they may be heat symptoms, if the discharge has persisted for a long time, the fire pathogen is already gone, but the discharge continues because the pathway is unable to seal properly. Therefore, new cases are often due to heat, while chronic cases may not necessarily all be heat symptoms.

This is actually due to the retention and stagnation of heat in the Yangming channel. Therefore, the internal treatment should focus on clearing fire and qi, while external treatment should utilize Huang Bai San, Qian Jin Polyp Decoction, Xiong Huang San, or simpler formulas for polyps. For a red nose caused by excessive drinking, this often occurs in individuals who enjoy alcohol, leading to damp-heat invading and steaming the lungs, resulting in blood heat.

I have used this method on several patients, and all had foul odor removed from the nose like decaying bones—unbearable smell, and their conditions were completely cured. The \"Orthodox Surgical Texts\" details a secret method for treating nasal hemorrhoids. First, use fennel powder and blow into the nostrils twice. Then, take two fine copper chopsticks with a small hole drilled in one end, threading a silk string through. Maintain a gap of about five minutes between the ends of the chopsticks, inserting the ends directly onto the root of the nasal hemorrhoid. Twist the string tightly and pull down; the hemorrhoid will naturally come off. Place it in water to observe its size, and use powdered fetal hair and ivory mixed to blow into the nostrils; this will stop the bleeding. Avoid spicy foods. The \"Complete Works of Jingyue\" states that moxibustion at the Yuhui point seven times treats nasal issues and hemorrhoids. For treating thick nasal discharge, apply moxibustion at the Shangxing point three times or seven times, and at the Tongtian point seven times; after moxibustion, nasal discharge will be expelled, leading to recovery.

Duke Di Liang pulled back the reins and observed from a distance a large board with big characters stating: \"Whoever can cure this child shall be rewarded with a thousand bolts of silk.\" Upon closer inspection, he saw a wealthy family's child, about fourteen or fifteen years old, lying beneath the board with a growth at the tip of his nose, as large as a fist, its base attached to the nose like the stem of food, causing severe pain when touched. His eyes were almost closed by the growth, the whites of his eyes showing as he writhed in agony, close to death. Compassionately pondering for some time, he then said: \"I can treat this.\" The child's parents and relatives bowed their heads in prayer, promptly offering a thousand bolts of silk set beside him. The Duke ordered them to help the child sit up, then inserted a needle about an inch behind the head, asking the patient: \"Has the needle's energy reached the afflicted area?\" The patient nodded. The Duke swiftly withdrew the needle and the growth fell off easily, instantly restoring the child's eyes to their original state without pain. The parents and family, weeping and bowing in gratitude, offered him silk as a gift. The Duke smiled and said: \"I grieve for the severity of your situation; I am merely a physician responding hastily to a dire need. I am not a performer of tricks.\" He disregarded their offerings and left.

I assessed that the Yin fire of the kidney was harming and overcoming the lung metal, so I treated him with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, adding Mai Dong, Wu Wei, and roasted Shan Zhi, along with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and he recovered. In the first year of Wujing, when a person suffered from a cold with phlegm, he used medication to disperse the exterior and transform phlegm. With excessive phlegm causing coughing, his abdomen was distended, and his face was pale—indicative of a deficiency in the spleen that could not generate lung metal. I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Jie Geng, and he immediately recovered. After three days, the previous symptoms reappeared, with a clear nasal discharge, indicating a recurrence of a cold. I used the previous medication, adding Sang Pi and Xing Ren, as well as Jie Geng, and he recovered. Zhong Suzi from Changzhou had an abscess on his nose, belonging to superficial pathogenic factors, but both his qi and blood were deficient, preventing the dispersal. So, I primarily used Bu Zhong Yi Qi, supporting it with Fang Feng and Bai Zhi, and he recovered. In \"Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng,\" it is said that Sun's aunt had not smelled any scents for many years. Later, due to another illness, her friend Miao Zhongchun prescribed a formula, using Sang Bai Pi in amounts of seven to eight qian; after taking it for some time, her nasal congestion unexpectedly resolved. In \"Han Shi Yi Tong,\" it is recorded that a nobleman had a fleshy growth in his nose, emitting an unbearable odor and causing pain upon any movement, leaving him helpless. I simply used a bit of powdered alum mixed with a small amount of Nao Sha, blowing it into the nostrils, and shortly thereafter it transformed into water and disappeared. Along with this, I applied Sheng Shi Tang combined with Xie Bai San in two doses, and he was cured.
