<p><strong>The Yellow Emperor&#39;s Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang Correspondences</strong></p>
<p>Dryness overcomes wind.<br><strong>[Note: Dryness belongs to the metal qi of the west; in seasonal and five-element qi, there are interactions of mutual generation and mutual restraint.]</strong> The west generates dryness.<br><strong>[Note: The west governs the autumn&#39;s metal decree, hence its qi generates dryness.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Principles of Organ Qi and Seasonal Discussions</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys suffer from dryness; one should urgently eat spicy foods to moisten it. Opening the pores allows for the transmission of fluids and unblocks the qi.<br><strong>[Note: The kidneys are the water organ, favoring moisture and disliking dryness; thus, one should consume spices to moisten it, as spices can open the pores, facilitating the movement of fluids and unblocking qi, hence providing moisture.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Qi Convergence and Change</strong></p>
<p>When the annual metal is excessive, the dry qi flows, causing the liver wood to be harmed, resulting in the people suffering from pain in the lower abdomen and flanks, red and painful eyes, eye sores, and deafness; if the killing influence is severe, one feels body heaviness, chest pain radiating to the back, fullness and pain in the flanks and lower abdomen.<br><strong>[Note: When the annual metal is excessive and the dry qi flows, the liver wood is afflicted. Pain in the lower abdomen and flanks indicates liver disease. The liver opens to the eyes, hence the eye pain and sores. If the liver is weak, one may experience deafness. Heaviness of the body results from severe killing influence, lacking vital energy. Distress arises when the liver qi is stagnant and cannot flow.]</strong> When the annual wood is insufficient, dryness becomes predominant.<br><strong>[Note: When the seasonal qi is insufficient, it is overpowered and thus subjected to it. Therefore, when the wood movement of the year is insufficient, the metal’s dryness becomes predominant.]</strong><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>The Great Discussion on the Five Constants and Governance</h3>
<p>To examine the year of balanced harmony, its command is dryness.<br><em>Note: The year of balanced harmony corresponds to the element of metal. In the heavens, it represents dryness, which reflects the command of metal.</em>  </p>
<p>In the year of firm completion, dryness governs its governance.<br><em>Note: The year of excessive metal corresponds to firm completion. Autumn is the season of harvest; thus, dryness governs its governance.</em>  </p>
<h3>The Great Discussion on the Six Origins and Correct Governance</h3>
<p>The governance of the sun and the heavens operates when the three energies are present; heavenly governance spreads, coolness comes forth, and dryness and heat intertwine, leading to extreme dryness and moisture, causing the people to suffer from cold and heat.<br><em>Note: The influence of metal energy comes down from heaven, thus the heavenly governance spreads and coolness manifests. The three dominant energies indicate the lesser yang fire, hence dryness and heat intertwine. The culmination of these energies transitions to the cold, wet earth of the fourth season, resulting in extreme dryness and moisture. The interplay of dryness, moisture, water, and fire causes the populace to suffer from cold afflictions.</em>  </p>
<p>The governance of the great yin and the heavens operates when the five energies are present; the dominance of moisture over dryness becomes stronger, heavy阴 energy manifests, cold energy affects the body, and wind and rain arise.<br><em>Note: The guest energy of the five corresponds to the great yin, damp earth, while the dominant energy reflects the sun&#39;s dry metal; therefore, moisture prevails over dryness. The heavy yin manifests with cold affecting the body, as both energies predominantly influence coolness. The arrival of the great yin concludes with rain, while the sun brings desolation, hence the advent of wind and rain.</em>  </p>
<p>When metal congestion occurs, dryness enables its governance. The people suffer from coughing, reverse flow, fullness in the chest and side, severe pain making it difficult to turn, dry throats, and a pale complexion.<br><em>Note: This indicates that the return of metal energy, when coupled with liver wood, leads to illness.</em>  <a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>When Yangming arrives, dryness is generated.<br>[Note: This is the common law of moral transformation.]<br>When dryness prevails, it leads to desiccation.<br>[Note: The dry air in autumn is significant for seventy-two days with peculiar effects.]  </p>
<p>Yangming governs the heavens; its transformation brings dryness, dictating to the afflicted based on the positions of the organs it encounters.<br>[Note: The organ locations refer to where the atmospheric influence descends and aligns with human organs, determining ailments according to where dryness has produced injury.]<br>In a year when Yangming is in the Well (Q泉), the excessive dryness leads people to suffer from nausea, often bitter; they sigh heavily, experience pain in the chest and sides, unable to turn over; in severe cases, their throat is parched, their face covered in fine dust, their bodies lacking moisture, and their feet feel externally hot.<br>[Note: Yangming being in the Well pertains to the cycle of the year. The meridian section states: nausea with bitterness, frequent sighing, pain in the chest, unable to change sides, severe cases showing a dusty face and lack of bodily moisture, with feet feeling hot externally, indicative of a lesser Yang condition. A dry throat and dusty face indicate a condition of the lesser Yin. This is due to metal prevailing, leading to liver and gallbladder ailments.]<br>Excessive internal dryness should be treated with bitter warmth, complemented by sweet and pungent elements to promote downward movement.<br>[Note: Dryness represents cool, clear metal energy; thus, treatment should employ bitter warmth. As dryness causes internal stagnation, it is necessary to complement with sweet and pungent dispersing agents to facilitate downward movement through bitterness.]<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Yangming governs the heavens, and dryness overcomes excess. The people suffer from left-sided rib pain, cold and clarity within, leading to malaria. Symptoms include severe chills, coughing, rumbling in the abdomen, diarrhea resembling muddy water, violent pain in the heart and ribs that makes it hard to turn, dryness in the throat, dusty face, back pain, hernias in men, lower abdominal pain in women, eye redness and pus, and furunculosis. The root of these illnesses is in the liver. When the Tai Chong pulse is blocked, it results in death without treatment.</p>
<p>Dryness overcomes excess; balance it with bitter warmth, supplemented with sour and acrid flavors to drain it downward.</p>
<p>Dryness transforms upwards, while heat counteracts it. Treat with acrid cold, supplemented with bitter sweetness.</p>
<p>The explanation indicates that when the six energies govern the heavens and the evil energies counteract, it&#39;s appropriate to balance with the flavors that overcome them.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>The Spiritual Pivot: The Chapter on the Nine Palaces and Eight Winds</strong></p>
<p>The wind comes from the west and is called the Strong Wind. Its harm manifests internally in the lungs and externally on the skin. Its nature is to be drying. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Dryness</strong></p>
<p>Drought causes things to wither, to become dry and cracked, which is all related to dryness. The Yangming (Lung) is characterized by Dry Metal, which pertains to the energies of the lungs and large intestine. When something is dry, it becomes sluggish; when moist, it becomes smooth and supple. Thus, dryness and moisture are opposed. When the body is entirely dry and sluggish, it is related to the transformation of Dry Metal, hence autumn is characterized by dryness. </p>
<p>Conditions such as numbness can also arise from dryness, caused by a deficiency of fluid leading to dryness and stagnation, obstructing the smooth flow of energy. Strong forces that invade can lead to numbness as well. However, the six energies do not necessarily act independently in causing illness; they can combine. For instance, if fluids are lost leading to dryness or numbness without heat signs, one should use herbs like Wufu (Piper) to clear the pathways for beneficial flow. </p>
<p>If wind and heat prevail over dampness leading to dryness, one should dispel the wind, disperse the heat, invigorate the blood, nourish the fluids, and use cool herbs to alleviate dryness—then numbness can heal. This principle applies to all cases of dryness and stagnation. </p>
<p>Withering signifies a lack of nourishment. Drought signifies an absence of fluids.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Dryness does not bring moisture. Rigor is not gentle. The oppositions of spring and autumn and the differences of dryness and moisture are the reasons for this. The great principle: external heat manifests as heat on the surface, while thirst for water indicates internal heat. When the body is warm and one drinks water, both external and internal are heated; when the body is cool and not thirsty, both external and internal have no heat. Therefore, the classics do not take fire to alleviate thirst, stating that thirst is not only caused by heat. For instance, in cases of illness from cold leading to vomiting or diarrhea, excessive loss of fluids can also cause dryness and thirst. Even if illness presents with wind-heat but the fluids have not yet diminished, there may still be no thirst. Can one say that thirst is only caused by heat and not by cold? The condition of dry thirst is often accompanied by heat, hence the Yi says: &quot;What dries all things, nothing is more intense than fire.&quot; Thus, when stating that thirst is due to dryness, this encompasses all aspects. As for the principle that when the body is cool and there is no thirst, it indicates that both external and internal lack heat, hence it is not described as cold.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>It is said that if there is a slight warmth inside and out, there may also be a body that is not hot yet does not feel thirsty; this cannot be inappropriate. Cracking and peeling refer to the skin’s rifts. The dry corresponds to heaven and represents dry metal, while the wet corresponds to earth and represents damp soil. Heaven and earth are opposites, and dry and wet have different functions. Thus, dry metal governs tightness and contraction, so autumn pulses are tight, fine, and subtle; while wet soil governs relaxation and expansion, leading to the June pulse being relaxed, large, and long. When the earth is moist, it is relaxed, smooth, and slippery; when dry, it is tight, constricted, and parched; the principle of cracking and peeling is clearly observable. It is commonly said that cracking and peeling are due to wind, as wind can overcome moisture and cause dryness. The classics state that the jue yin point is where the wind resides, leading to cracks; thus, the wind prevails over moisture and causes dryness. The saying that the cold months are severe while the hot months decline is because cold can gather and constrict, closing the pores tight, leading to no sweat and dryness, thus intensifying illness.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>When heat prevails, the skin becomes relaxed, the pores open and sweat moistens, thus leading to illness and debilitation. If one experiences dryness and cracking due to water dampness on the skin, it is because water dampness invites wind and cold. </p>
<p>Excessive heat overcomes dryness, as dryness arises from metal, while heat transforms. When metal is abundant, it is restrained by fire; if the lungs are deficient, they are treated with bitterness. It is also said that the energy of metal is below, while the energy of fire supports it. When internal dryness prevails, it is treated with warm bitterness and assisted with sweet and pungent flavors to descend the bitterness. If lung energy ascends and reverses, quickly consume bitter to release it. </p>
<p>Wang notes that to restrain the excessive dryness, it must be done with warm bitterness; therefore, dry and withered conditions arise from this ailment. Hence, metal governs in autumn and belongs to yin, its energy being cool. When this coolness is extreme, the weather becomes clear and all things become dry, thus dryness resembles fire, indicating metal has reached its peak and now involves fiery transformation, leading to the ailment of depleted blood and fluids. When dryness of metal is extreme, it causes vexation, heat stagnation, and weakness of limbs, which cannot grasp or hold. </p>
<p>All signs of withering and desiccation, dryness, and cracking belong to dryness.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Those who are withered and dry have a deficiency of water and moisture, leading to insufficient nourishment of the flesh and poor circulation of qi. Therefore, the skin becomes cracked and dry, and when severe, it can cause numbness and paralysis. Those who are desiccated have little water and much fire. As stated in the &quot;Xi Ci&quot; (a text in the &quot;I Ching&quot;): nothing dries living things more than fire. Hence, when fire is extremely hot, moisture is depleted and fails to hydrate the body, causing the skin to crack, and the hands and feet to suffer deep wounds as if struck by an axe. This condition is worse in winter and less severe in summer. Thus, the principle states: cold can gather and constrict, which leads to dryness and cracking; heat can relax and expand, which results in nourishing and moisturizing. All of these belong to the transformation of dry metal. The commentary notes: living things are moist and smooth, while dead things are dry and withered.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>In governance, one should open and connect roads, nurture Yin and retreat Yang, use cool herbs to harmonize, and ensure the flow of blood; all ailments of numbness, insensitivity, and fatigue should find their place. Caution is advised against taking medicines containing lead. According to the principles of the five elements and the interactions of cold, heat, dryness, humidity, fire, and wind, the ways of Heaven can be seen, and the sickness of the people can be adjusted. All ailments stem from the ways of the five elements and the balance of the six Qi, through victory and restoration, as well as the alternation between prosperity and decline. Wang Zhu commented: Life has form, and one cannot be without afflictions. Once there are afflictions, there are also means of escape and transformation, manifesting beyond Yin and Yang. Thus, it is said: Carefully guard against the mechanisms of illness, each attending to their own domain. Some seek treatment, others don’t; some are criticized for being excessive, while others are criticized for being deficient. One must first ensure the dominance of the five elements, unclog the blood and Qi to achieve harmony and peace. This is what is meant. </p>
<p>Dryness and desiccation are the basis of the metal lung; the lung stores air, for when blood damages the internal Qi, or in the presence of wind, it leads to fatigue. Wind can overcome moisture, and heat can consume liquid, both leading to dryness. Thus, the classics say: Wind, heat, and fire all belong to Yang, whereas cold, dryness, and humidity belong to Yin.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Dryness and dampness are indeed different. Though dry metal belongs to the autumnal yin, its nature differs from that of cold dampness, as dry yin prevails over the warmth of wind, heat, and fire. Therefore, when wind and heat are strong, they can similarly lead to dryness alongside cold dampness. Furthermore, internal cold may cause vomiting and diarrhea, depleting fluids and resulting in dryness, which is also explained by this principle. Hence, the classics state: all that is withered, dried up, or cracking belongs to dryness. </p>
<p>Dryness is the root of the metal-lung; dry metal transforms into dryness and withering upon receiving heat. Accompanied by heat, it leads to a weakening of metal, depleting fluids and diminishing blood, causing stagnation that results in dryness. Thus, the classics say: wind, heat, and fire all belong to yang; cold, dampness, and dryness all belong to yin. Moreover, dryness and dampness are also distinct. Although dry metal belongs to autumnal yin, its nature is different from cold dampness, and in fact, it aligns more with wind, heat, and fire. Additionally, if there is dry stool, it indicates that the large intestine is heated, transforming it into dryness and withering.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The classics say that all dryness and withering, like paralysis from a stroke, occur due to the consumption of blood by heat and fire, leading to the obstruction of the original cavities and the inability to nourish. The metal affected by fire becomes stagnant and cannot produce sound. </p>
<p>When limbs ache and feel weak, it is due to the attack of wind, heat, and dampness, resulting in local withering, hoarse voice, and limbs that do not follow commands. Similarly, internal cold causing vomiting and diarrhea can lead to loss of fluids and dryness. There are also instances of cold and dampness obstructing the flow of nutrients and defense, which often results in local atrophy. The classics state: all dryness and withering, roughness and peeling, relate to dryness.</p>
<p>Excessive heart fire from wild yang dries the three yang vessels and the stomach, causing stagnation and preventing water and fluids from circulating. As a result, the entire body lacks moisture, leading to emaciation and a yellow-black complexion, as well as dry heat and thirst. Even though one may drink extensively, the fluids cannot be absorbed into the stomach. Soups cannot settle the situation, leading to frequent urination. Common understanding has not been clarified; mistakenly attributing it to cold in the lower cavity has misled many.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Dryness</strong></p>
<p>Dryness causes stasis of blood, which cannot nourish and moisten; thus, it is necessary to nourish yin. The five flavors nourish the organs, while thirst due to yang concerns relates to the large intestine, which governs expulsion without retention. Now, if there is accumulation and obstruction, why is it unable to be resolved? This has its reasons. If pathogens invade internally, the stomach has dry feces; if there is heat in the three burners, bodily fluids are dried up, hence the large intestine harbors heat. In those with deficiency, the organs are cold and blood vessels are desiccated; in the elderly, the organs are cold and the pathways of qi are obstructed, thus the large intestine harbors cold. There are also cases of the intestines and stomach being affected by wind, leading to dryness and difficulty in excretion—this condition arises from accumulated wind and qi. If qi does not descend and the pathway for food becomes difficult, with nausea and fullness, there will certainly be corresponding symptoms. </p>
<p>When the skin cracks and splits, leading to severe pain and possible blood loss, or if the skin is dry and itchy, it is indicative of fire damaging the lung metal, which is extreme dryness. It is advisable to use a decoction of Four Substances, adding Chuanxiong, wheat, tianmen dong, ginseng, tianhua fen, huangbo, and wuweizi among other herbs to treat it.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Discourse on Dryness</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: all that is withered, dry, and parched belongs to dryness. The &quot;Original Disease Formulas&quot; indicates: the classics say that wind, heat, and fire are all Yang, while cold, dryness, and dampness are all Yin. Moreover, although dryness and dampness are slightly different, dry metal, though belonging to the autumn Yin, differs from cold dampness. Therefore, it is akin to wind and heat. Thus, when fire and heat are excessive, metal weakens and wind arises, because wind can overcome dampness and heat can consume fluids, leading to a condition where Yang is strong and Yin is deficient. As a result, wind and heat surpass water and dampness, causing dryness. In general, people suffering from wind diseases often have this condition due to excessive heat and dryness, with heat as the dominant factor. The liver governs the tendons, and when the wind is excessive, and dryness and heat are added, the tendons become overly dry. Dry metal governs contraction; its pulses are tight and constrained, resulting in injuries to the tendons making them tense and leading to a stiff mouth.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>If someone suffers from intense dryness and heat, resulting in extreme thirst, or if there is excessive wind-heat causing stagnation in the exterior while the internal energy is balanced, or if there is a deficiency in the extending tendons with tightness in the muscles, or if one occasionally feels cold with tense limbs, or if both wind and heat combine and cause severe internal stagnation, leading to heat and possible constipation; additionally, if wind-cerebral convulsions arise due to intense heat and dry wind transforming together, with phlegm overflowing and dryness irritating the chest and diaphragm, causing confusion and stiffness leading to collapse. All these symptoms originate from excess heat creating dry wind, with each illness being different because of varying degrees of wind-heat dryness. The so-called &quot;wind-stroke with loose tendons&quot; occurs when wind-heat prevails over dampness and leads to excessive dryness. Hence, when the tendons are loose and not retracted, it results in weakness and paralysis, thus conditions such as fullness and stagnation that lead to weakness relate to the lung&#39;s metal element, which is dryness transformed. Just as in deep autumn when dryness is excessive, plants wither and do not bear fruit, reflecting the symptoms of illness. Therefore, when blood is adequate, one can maintain strength; if blood is deficient, it cannot nourish the entire body, leading to such conditions.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> 【Ming, Li Zhan】</p>
<p><strong>Drought: Internal and External Factors</strong></p>
<p>External Causes: When the season of Yangming drought arrives, prolonged sunny weather without rain leads to yellow dust blocking the sky, causing confusion and madness in people, and skin becomes dry and scaly. Internal Causes: The seven emotions can generate heat and dryness, or constipation can lead to loss of body fluids, or dryness from metal and stone affects the blood, or overexertion in intimate relations can deplete essence, or disruptions from hunger, fullness, or fatigue harm the stomach, or consuming excessively roasted, alcoholic, thick-flavored foods can all intensify the fire evil, consuming and scorching the blood. </p>
<p>The six Qi: Wind, heat, and fire belong to Yang; cold, dryness, and dampness belong to Yin. Although dryness is linked to the autumn Yin, it negatively interacts with wind, heat, and fire. When the fire is vigorous, the metal is harmed by heat, wood cannot regulate and gives rise to wind, wind overcomes dampness, and heat diminishes body fluids. When it enters the liver, it causes the muscles and tendons to tighten and become stiff, leading to conditions like muscle spasm or paralysis of hands and feet, or numbness in the fingers making it impossible to scratch an itch, or causing visual impairments. When it enters the heart, it causes fainting, rigidity, and slurred speech; entering the spleen leads to fullness and a lack of appetite, or extreme hunger resulting in thinness, or causing stagnation that transforms into abdominal swelling; when it enters the lungs, it leads to dry skin and coughs; when it reaches the kidneys, it depletes fluids leading to thirst and bone steaming with secretive blockages. Overall, all these conditions relate to the lung metal, corresponding closely to the Yangming and the lungs.</p>
<p>For external ailments such as skin dryness and scaling, modify the Si Wu Decoction by removing Chuanxiong and combining it with Sheng Mai San while adding Zhimu, Bohe, and tianhuafen, or simply use tiandimenggao. If there&#39;s muscle spasm resulting in immobility, prescribe Daqin Jiao Decoction. For internal illnesses like diabetes, employ formulas that activate blood, moisten dryness, and generate fluids.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Dryness arises from the overactivity of the liver&#39;s wood element, or from wind entering the large intestine, termed &quot;wind dryness&quot;; for this, use Soothing Wind and Regulating Qi Pill. If it is due to heat accumulation in the organs or long-standing illness with stagnant heat, it is called &quot;heat dryness&quot;; for this, use Si Shun Qing Liang Drink or Dang Gui Long Hui Pill. If it is from hidden fire in the spleen and stomach leading to constipation and loss of appetite, it is termed &quot;blood dryness&quot;; for this, use Si Wu Decoction plus Da Huang and Tao Ren, or take it in pill form; for constipation, use Dao Zhi Tong You Decoction; for dysuria, use Dao Qi Chu Zao Decoction. If there is yin deficiency with fire dryness, it is termed &quot;deficiency dryness&quot;; for this, use Dan Huang Bo Pill, Bu Yin Pill, or Shen Qi Pill. For those who are exhausted and have qi deficiency and dryness, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. Generally, modify Si Wu Decoction by removing Chuanxiong, with Tian Men Dong and Mai Dong as the main ingredients, (Cao She) Lou as an assistant, and Sheng Ma, Hong Hua, and Gan Cao as aides. Add Qin Jiao or Niu Xi for wind-related issues, Huang Qin for heat-related problems, increase Di Huang for blood conditions, Tian Hua Fen and Wu Wei Zi for thirst, Da Huang, (Mu Yu) Li Ren, and Ma Ren for constipation, and increase Ren Shen and Huang Qi for qi deficiency, or add Zhi Mu and Huang Bo for yin deficiency. In general, it is advisable to use sweet, cool, and moistening agents, and to avoid pungent and aromatic herbs that stir up fire, as well as any diaphoretics. The classics state: &quot;To alleviate dryness, moisten it; this is called nourishing blood.&quot; For when dryness occurs, the blood thickens and the qi and fluids become stagnant; moisture encourages blood vitality and promotes the unblocking of qi and fluids, leading to a flourishing internal spirit and external radiance. Accumulated fluids can generate qi, and accumulated qi can produce fluids. For those with qi deficiency, use Qiong Yu Gao; for those with fluid deficiency, use Dan Wu Wei Zi Gao; for blood deficiency, use Di Huang Gao. Whenever illness encounters dryness from the environment, it is advisable to increase these moistening agents. </p>

<h3>On Autumn Drought</h3>
<p>The distinction between dryness and humidity is like the difference between heaven and earth. Dryness is the essence of heaven; humidity is the essence of earth. Water flows with humidity, while fire corresponds to dryness; each follows its nature, where one conquers the other, and they do not balance. In spring, the energy of the earth stirs and humidity prevails, allowing plants to flourish; in autumn, the energy of heaven is austere and dryness prevails, causing plants to yellow and fall. Thus, the humidity after the spring equinox and the dryness after the autumn equinox each have their own role. </p>
<p>Now, to refer to the dryness of the autumn moon as humidity must imply that the heat of the summer months is understood as cold for it to make sense. However, the Inner Canon lists nineteen causes of disease but omits dry air, while all other mentions of autumn injuries refer to injuries from humidity. Scholars of all ages have interpreted the text literally without discerning this error, so it is imperative to correct it. The general understanding suggests that spring is injured by wind, summer by heat, late summer by humidity, autumn by dryness, and winter by cold, aligning with the principles of the six energies corresponding to the four seasons and not contradicting the cycles of five movements; thus, the great doubts of the ages finally begin to unravel.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>Can autumn dryness be disregarded? Autumn does not become dry hastily; it follows great heat and then is accompanied by coolness. When coolness arises, heat dissipates, gradually leading to greater coolness and the onset of dryness. The scripture states that where the Yangming reaches, it first brings dryness and ultimately results in coolness, which is a misinterpretation. Is it possible that amidst the new autumn&#39;s moonlight and dew sparkling, the stars shimmering over serene depths, the fragrance of heaven pervading the fields, the myriad treasures bearing fruit, dryness is the cause? Until the mountains are empty, the moon is small, the waters recede revealing the stones, the heavens release abundant frost, and the earth solidifies into white salt, such a transformation that seems harsh and urgent should be regarded as the onset of coolness, not dryness. Some may doubt that dryness stems from fire, thus suggesting it is dry first and then cool; this reasoning lacks merit. Indeed! The &quot;Essentials of Ancient Pulses&quot; states: Spring does not sink, summer does not straighten, autumn does not number, winter does not clog; this is called the four blockages. It indicates that if the pulse of the seasons does not follow a gradual progression, it becomes blocked and unable to circulate. Thus, the pulses of the months in spring, summer, autumn, and winter should still adhere to the established norms of the respective months of winter, spring, summer, and autumn, without alteration.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>After the double division and double arrival, one begins to turn towards the royal energy of the original decree, thus forming the pulse of ordinary people. Therefore, the heavenly way does not separate and does not warm in spring, nor reaches but does not heat in summer; the movement of nature is long-lasting and boundless. If in the pulse of humans, spring corresponds with strings, and summer corresponds with numbers, haste and urgency add up, not three seasons and the year finishes, how can it last for long? Indeed, this is the reason why in autumn, the moon is avoided in the number of pulses, because the new autumn is vanquished by dryness, hence it is to be avoided. If a person is not ill, and in the new autumn has a pulse with slight numbers, this is the genuine pulse of heaven, why then should it be avoided? Furthermore, initial dryness leads to cooling, and when cooling occurs, it should naturally turn to cold; why then does it return to warmth in October? When cooling returns to warmth, the order of time is lost; does not the heavenly way stagnate? Not understanding that the warmth of October does not turn from cooling, it actually arises from dryness. Below the position of metal, the energy of fire supports it, therefore early winter is often warm. The response of the pulse still derives from the dryness of metal.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>From the moist to the stagnant, its moisture is the gold of living water, and its stagnation is indeed the gold in water. The brilliance of pearls and the luster of jade, could they harm dryness? Yet, the coolness of early autumn serves to ward off the summer heat, and the heat suffered during summer is indeed released by the coolness. The classics say: when one sweats not during heat, autumn brings forth wind-epidemics. One epidemics, and all who take coolness through the wind and use water to wash away sweat, until sweat is no more and harm is done within, will have illnesses arising like those treated in the case of epidemics. Internal harm resulting from cold stagnation may also be compared to epidemics. Since their origin is all the pathogenic dampness of summer, despite the different external and internal dominions, they all arise from the autumn wind. However, when we speak of deep autumn&#39;s dry metal dominating ailments, it is quite different. The classics state: dryness overcomes, therefore it is dry. The harms of dryness are not merely vast, barren lands. There is dryness externally causing chapping; there is dryness internally exhausting essence and blood; there is dryness in bodily fluids causing a decline in protective energy, with flesh scorched and skin adhering to bones. Each illness is affected by the larger channels and smaller collaterals, related to their respective top, bottom, middle, outside, front, and back. Where dryness prevails, it is also called burning. As for the injuries, they are even more severe.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>The dryness of metal injures, primarily harming the liver wood; if severe, it can even lead to self-harm of the lung metal. The lung metal is responsible for qi and regulates the circulatory pathways. This situation only arises with metal born from earth, which is strong and unyielding, thus allowing for freedom in life and death, maintaining order without disorder. If the illness arises in autumn and is caused by dryness, the metal suffers from the punishment of fire, transforming its rigidity into softness, becoming round and compliant to shape, desiring to retain its previous clarity and solemnity—how can this be achieved?</p>
<p>Classically, it is stated that persistent coughs resulting in white blood signify death; this white blood is described as light red, resembling flesh or lung. If there is no self-consumption of the lung metal, how could this occur? Consider the essence of grasses and trees which can be gathered; when exposed to the essence of metal, it suddenly alters its appearance, scorching its upper part, while the dry qi first harms the upper burner. Isn’t this clear?</p>
<p>Upon thorough examination, all the pathogenic qi related to lung issues relates to the lung; conditions such as weakness, shortness of breath, and vomiting all pertain to the upper part. These two lines distinctly illustrate the dryness-related illnesses. The theory of living qi ascending to the heavens states: autumn harms through dryness, leads to upward rebellion and cough, resulting in weakness and collapse. The essence of dry illness, succinctly stated, aligns perfectly with the two aspects of pathogenic mechanism.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The misunderstanding of dryness as dampness has led to confusion in the principles of treatment. Thus, I will discuss the nature of dryness so that its definition is clear. Symptoms of dryness include pain in the left side, inability to turn over, a dry throat, a dusty face, lack of moisture in the body, heat in the feet, lower back pain, muscle spasms, hernias in men, abdominal pain in women, and eye problems. These signs indicate that dryness originates in the liver and manifests in various ways. According to the Inner Canon, dryness is overcome by moisture, and its treatment must involve bitter and cold remedies to counteract its supremacy. If the condition requires supplementation, one should add sour elements; if it requires purging, then add pungent elements. When administering laxatives, the use of bitter and warm substances is advised. If excessive cold is present, then cold laxatives should be avoided in favor of warm ones. Even when there is excess energy, one should only use pungent purgatives, not cold ones. It is essential to understand that the metal (lung) element fears heat, while dryness also fears cold. Thus, remedies that are neutral to cold and supplemented with bitter and sweet are ideal. A harmonious balance of hot and cold is the best approach to treatment.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Moreover, when encountering the lower descending Qi of the six energies, it is advisable to make slight changes accordingly. For instance, when fire Qi is underneath gold, it is necessary to reduce the attributes of bitterness and warmth, for fear that fire may strengthen fire. When using these methods, one should also transform bitterness and warmth to align with the cooling nature. This reflects the essence of treating dryness and excess from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and could be endorsed as a principle.</p>
<p>As for lung Qi being oppressed, causing weakness, wheezing, vomiting, and coughing, these are serious ailments caused by intense dryness, and cannot be resolved by a single method of treatment. Therefore, it is included under the category of dryness and should be carefully deliberated for effective treatment. Scholars should diligently seek understanding in this area, and they will inevitably find success. If one only uses moistening to treat dryness without considering the condition of the illness or its suitability to the symptoms, it would still be coarse and inadequate.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Bi&quot; states: Yin Qi, when still, preserves the spirit; when agitated, it dissipates. Below, it merely notes that excessive eating harms the intestines and stomach, and does not pertain to the lungs. The reasons for agitation and the dissipation of Yin Qi have been touched upon but not fully explored. As the &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; mentions, exposure to cold drinks harms the lungs, establishing that lung injury is related to cold.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>It can be seen that the lung Qi manifests outwardly through the skin and hair, and internally it travels through the waterways. When exposed to cold, the external chill enters through the skin; when drinking cold, the cold water rises from the chest, restricting the lung Qi and preventing it from spreading outward and descending. This stagnation disrupts its regulation, resulting in the body&#39;s Qi being unable to rise and support the lungs, leading to lung disease. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the lungs are delicate organs; about 20-30% suffer from cold damage, while 70-80% are harmed by heat. Cold mainly constricts the exterior, while heat consumes within, causing more severe harm. When the lungs are injured by heat, it results in stagnant Qi, leading to various symptoms like weakness, coughing, and vomiting, resulting in dryness. </p>
<p>Most herbal formulas, such as those containing Wu Yao, Xiang Fu, Zi Su, Ban Xia, Fu Ling, Hou Po, Ding, Chen, He, Gao, Jiang, Gui, Peng, Ling, Bing Lang, and Yi Zhi, follow traditional patterns. This is due to the &quot;Nei Jing&quot; neglecting dry symptoms, leading later practitioners to mistakenly treat dryness with dryness, being complacent in their methods and ignoring the depletion of Yin Qi. </p>
<p>Even the great sage of Dongyuan, in addressing dry conditions, only focuses on nourishing the blood and enriching the liver and kidney, dealing only with issues of constipation, without considering the lungs.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Is it said that the middle and lower jiaos suffer from dryness, while the upper jiao is unaffected? This is merely a misunderstanding of the essential teachings regarding dampness, which leads to oversight. The various qi stagnations associated with the lungs pertain to lung dryness, not lung dampness. If lung qi is not dry, then the various qi can be clear and dispersive, circulating throughout the body; how then could there be stagnation? The conditions of weakness, coughing, and vomiting that pertain to the upper jiao refer to the lungs and not the heart. If one speaks of the upper jiao as encompassing both heart and lungs, then illnesses of the heart do not cause weakness, coughing, or vomiting; only severe lung dryness can lead to lung atrophy and unresponsiveness, lung qi rebellion causing wheezing, and difficulty in passing food through the diaphragm resulting in vomiting—these three are all manifestations of extreme dryness.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The scripture initially states that when faced with autumn’s chilling qi, the Taiyin cannot absorb it. It discusses the condition of the lungs being filled with heat and whether this can be called a damp disease. Further examination of Dongyuan’s treatment for lung consumption shows the use of cardamom and bitter herbs, along with aromatic and qi-regulating medicines, indicating a lack of awareness regarding the harm of dryness. </p>
<p>Moreover, Danxi’s eclectic approach, which later generations have adopted, does not suggest any single method concerning lung dryness. In the discussion of the heat-accumulating decoction, it mentions that some cases arise from yin deficiency and others from gastric weakness due to consuming cold food, which restrains the yang qi within the spleen. The treatment methods are seen in the fever-related sections.</p>
<p>This treatment is neither for yin deficiency, nor for yang collapse, nor does it indicate fever, yet the persistent steam-like feeling remains unresolved. Such persistence may imply that the lung qi is internally steamed by heat, unable to express outwardly. Thus, a formula is constructed using eight ingredients: forsythia, mint, scutellaria, gardenia seeds, ophiopogon, licorice, curcuma, and bamboo leaves as a guide. </p>
<p>Afterwards, it poses a question regarding the absence of actions involving angelica and cyperus. The response is that fire exacerbates dryness, and drying medicines can facilitate fire; therefore, they are not used. This formula indicates a reluctance to use drying agents that amplify heat in the context of heat accumulation, suggesting a cautious avoidance of further damaging the lung’s metal element, as can be subtly inferred.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>What is the reason for not establishing a particular doctrine for the treatment of dryness diseases, and to express its meaning freely? Similarly, the methods used by Miao Zhongchun to treat diseases mainly involve the Four Gentlemen, Four Substances, Two Winters, Two Mothers, various herbs such as Sha Shen, Yuan Shen, Huang Qi, Shan Yao, Su Zi, Ju Hong, Sang Ye, Pi Pa Ye, Xing Ren,zao Ren, Bian Dou, Lian Xin, (Cao She) Lou, Wu Wei, Sheng, Ge, Chai, Qian, Qin, Lian, Zhi, Bo, Hua Shi, Shi Gao, Ju Hua, Gou Qi, Niu Xi, Xu Duan, Yi Yi, Mu Guo, Hu Ma, Shou Wu, Dou Chi, Shuang Mei, and others like them. The recipes, totaling in the thousands, mostly involve the selection from these, with the addition of one or two items for matching, forming their own distinct school of thought. Those in the know remark that it does not fully rely on the formulas recorded in classics, yet yields results when applied, uniquely opening a new path. Others claim that it excels in materia medica, opting for fifty or sixty reliable herbs, repeatedly achieving extraordinary outcomes, providing no further means. Chang disagrees. Many in the world suffer from dryness diseases; Zhongchun prefers to use moistening agents, which seems to uniquely open a new path to treating dryness.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>However, it is also clever and coincidental, yet there has yet to be a discovery that can treat internal dryness but cannot address external dryness, let alone the effects of wind, cold, heat, and humidity. One should select the beneficial aspects. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: when the heart moves heat to the lungs, it results in dysphoria. The source of lung dryness is quite distant! If a person&#39;s kidney water is sufficient and ascends to engage with the heart, then the heart fire descends to connect with the kidney, and does not transmit to the lungs. If the heart fire does not affect the lungs, then how could there be concerns about dryness? Even if the kidney water appears insufficient, the fluids and blood in the intestines and stomach are enough to support upward, so the lungs would not suffer excess harm. If, however, the lower moisture is completely depleted, but the high source of water is still able to remain without spilling, then there would certainly be no matter at all. Therefore, the scriptures further state: &quot;The two yangs connected are referred to as dysphoria.&quot; The hand yangming large intestine experiences heat accumulation where fluids do not moisten, and the foot yangming stomach has heat accumulation where blood is not nourished, leading to the formation of thirst syndrome, with a red and cracked tongue and extreme thirst prompting drinking. This is related to the heart transferring heat to the lungs, resulting in dysphoria; though the wording is different, the meaning is the same. To treat dysphoria, use the White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng to support the lungs, alleviating various symptoms such as qi stagnation, weakness, cough, and vomiting; all will be addressed accordingly.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Can scholars not draw analogies and broaden their understanding in pursuit of this path? The discussion of Yin and Yang states: When both Yang conditions affect the heart and spleen, there are hidden obstacles; for men, there is a deficiency of essence, and for women, a lack of menstrual flow. This results in conditions such as &quot;wind consumption&quot; or &quot;breath and oppression,&quot; which lead to death if untreated. This also arises from dryness in the lungs, which has not yet been uncovered. Dryness diminishes male essence and produces deficiencies in female fluids, leading to severe conditions. Initially, this primarily affects concealed matters. Subsequently, the dryness of the stomach transfers to the spleen, resulting in &quot;wind consumption.&quot; &quot;Wind consumption&quot; refers to the heat of wind causing depletion of muscle and flesh. The dryness in the large intestine moves to the lungs, resulting in &quot;breath and oppression.&quot; &quot;Breath and oppression&quot; refers to breath that flows upward without descending. Thus, the intestines and stomach, along with the heart and spleen, contribute to the dryness of the lung&#39;s metal element. When the three organs and two bowels suffer from such a depletion of Yin energy, is there still hope for treatment? The heart and lungs have already succumbed to the realm of death&#39;s Yin. However, the spleen disperses the essence of the two Yangs upward to the lungs, still allowing for some slight recovery.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Now, the harm of dryness causes those who give life to turn completely to seek my life, hence the direct diagnosis is death without treatment. Previously, I was confused, but now I clarify. </p>
<p>The nineteenth clause of the disease mechanism states: all drought, withered and drained, dryness of energy and cracked skin, all belong to dryness. Although dry metal is associated with autumn and belongs to the yin channels, it differs from cold dampness and resembles fire heat. When fire heat dominates, metal weakens; when fire heat prevails, wind becomes fierce. Wind can overcome dampness, and heat can consume fluids, turning the situation into a manifestation of excess yang and deficiency of yin, hence the qi of wind, fire, and heat overcomes water and earth, resulting in dryness.</p>
<p>The liver governs the tendons. When wind qi prevails, combined with dryness and heat, fluids accumulate in the chest and diaphragm, failing to nourish the tendons, which leads to dryness in the tendons. Thus, they become rigid and tense, resulting in a closed mouth, or possibly convulsions, fainting, stiffness, and collapse. </p>
<p>When wind and heat are excessively dry, causing stagnation on the surface while the internal qi is balanced, they stretch and contract inappropriately, with the tendons feeling tight, accompanied by occasional chills or spasms. The pulse is rapid and tense. However, if wind, heat, and dryness combine with severe internal stagnation, it will surely lead to distressing fullness and blockage, indicating that dryness discriminates between external and internal qi and blood.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>As for the condition of loose tendons not contracting and the loss of sensation, it is due to the prevailing influence of wind-heat overcoming dampness, leading to prolonged dryness, which results in severe dryness disease. Regarding the various conditions of oppression and fullness, along with weakness, coughing, and vomiting, all belong to the lungs. The metal element transforms through dryness, and the lungs themselves suffer, leading to a gradual decline in lung qi; what more can be said about weakness and paralysis?</p>
<p>The five organs and their corresponding emotions are nourished by true fluids, thus remaining still and unchanging. True fluids, in particular, rely on the kidney&#39;s yin essence and the stomach&#39;s fluid, which flow together without ceasing. If the water from the kidney and stomach is not replenished, the true yin of the five organs will be depleted, causing the fires of the five emotions to stir within, resulting in the diseases of the three areas of upper, middle, and lower. As Hejian states, excessive dryness leading to the desiccation of the spleen and stomach results in thirst, which is also one manifestation. </p>
<p>Dryness diseases inevitably cause thirst, yet the causes of thirst differ significantly.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>There is thirst due to heart and lung deficiency, liver stagnation, spleen heat, kidney heat, and excessive heat in the stomach and intestines. Thirst may also arise from illness such as malaria, from indulging in rich foods, from drunkenness and overindulgence, from the fatigue of long journeys in the heat, from injury to the stomach due to dryness, or from wind. The five organs are affected differently, and the conditions they encounter vary, but the result is the same: dryness and heat lead to the loss of fluids. </p>
<p>To treat dryness-related diseases, one should nourish the kidney’s water and cool the deficient yin, while purging the excess fire from the heart and alleviating the severe dryness and heat in the intestines, thereby replenishing the fluids in the stomach. This ensures that pathways are unobstructed, fluids are generated and not depleted, and that qi and blood flow freely, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>The kidneys dislike dryness, so one should quickly consume spicy foods to moisten them. The kidneys govern the five fluids; if they are full, then defecation remains normal. However, if one experiences hunger, fullness, overexertion, or consumes overly spicy and heavy foods, it can exacerbate the fire evil, depleting true yin and causing a deficiency in fluids, leading to dry stools. </p>
<p>Zhongjing stated: if a person has slight diarrhea but constipated stools, one should not forcibly purge it; instead, use pills to moisten the spleen. Be cautious of excessive purging, which can severely damage the fluids. However, there are distinctions between yang and yin stagnation in the organs: yang stagnation should be treated with cool, spicy remedies, while yin stagnation requires warm, spicy treatments; the distinctions are subtle.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>In treating diseases caused by dryness in autumn, mistaking it for humidity is a matter of grave error. In the past, it could be excused due to a lack of understanding. Now that it is clearly known, those who knowingly make the mistake will inevitably cause harm. Facing the consequences of one&#39;s actions, regret will come too late.</p>
<p>When treating dryness diseases, if the dryness is related to qi, then blood should be treated; if related to blood, then qi should be treated; if it appears on the surface, then the inner condition should be treated; if it lies within, then the surface should be treated. If the medicine used is inappropriate for the illness, the fault lies with the physician.</p>
<p>In treating mixed diseases with accompanying dryness symptoms, mistakenly using dry medicines can lead to an exacerbation of the condition, resulting in danger and difficulty, which is the physician’s fault.</p>
<p>When treating dryness diseases, it is essential to distinguish between the liver and lung conditions. If the liver shows symptoms, one can treat the dryness of the lungs. However, if the lungs exhibit symptoms but the liver is treated instead, that would be a gross error, and the fault lies with the physician. When the liver shows dryness, immediate attention should be given to the liver to prevent it from suffering further harm. Nevertheless, clearing the lungs and eliminating the root of dryness should be prioritized. If the lung condition is self-contained and does not affect the liver, focusing solely on the lungs is not only risky due to potential damage but should be approached with caution.</p>
<p>In essence, when treating dryness diseases, failing to grasp the true intention behind treating dryness and merely using lubricating agents may not cause severe harm, but it still wastes time and shows a lack of skill, which should be avoided.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>On the Clearing and Moistening Lung Decoction</strong></p>
<p>It is noted that the various forms of Qi stagnation related to the lungs are due to dryness in the lungs. Historically and in modern times, treatments for Qi stagnation use pungent and aromatic herbs to promote Qi flow, but there has been no method aimed specifically at treating lung dryness. Conditions like weakness, coughing, and vomiting that pertain to the upper body are also linked to lung dryness. Yet, treatments have classified weakness and vomiting under the Yangming channel, and coughing under the lung, which means that vomiting and weakness are classified among the middle and lower parts, while coughing is placed in the upper. Therefore, among countless prescriptions, there isn&#39;t a single one that addresses lung dryness. Even with coughs related to the lung, treatments tend to either release the exterior, drain downward, or promote Qi movement. Occasionally, there are a few prescriptions that use moistening agents, but they fail to address the root cause effectively. In summary, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions the six energies but mistakenly attributes the autumn&#39;s dryness to an error, conflating it with the humidity of late summer mistaking it for autumn dryness.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Later generations dare not alter this discourse, neglecting this one principle. Even when clearly knowing the dryness of the principle, they use overly complex remedies, like shooting at flying insects without a definite method. Now I propose a formula named Clear Dryness to Rescue the Lung Decoction, primarily based on stomach qi, as the stomach is the mother of lung metal. Although Asparagus root can protect the lungs, it is bitter and can cause qi stagnation, which may harm the stomach and obstruct phlegm, so it is not used. Similarly, Rehmannia can nourish kidney water and clear lung metal, but it is also bitter and thus not used. Regarding bitter cold herbs that lower fire, they are especially to be avoided. Indeed, the lung metal succumbs to dryness, and the remaining yin essence is just a thin thread. If further bitter cold herbs are used to lower qi, it will damage the stomach; can the person still have vitality? Truly, adjustments made in this way can alleviate lung dryness and various derived symptoms, akin to dousing a fire to quench a burn, not shunning frequent application, so there may be hope for recovery.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>The Complete Text of Jingyue</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jiebin)</p>
<p><strong>The Difference Between Internal and External Dryness</strong></p>
<p>Although dryness is also a type of external pathogen, it contains both yin and yang aspects. The yang aspect is associated with heat, while the yin aspect arises from cold. Heat damages yin, which is necessarily linked to the organs; cold damages yang, which is necessarily linked to the channels. This is why it is important to discern and treat the internal and external manifestations. </p>
<p>The signs of dryness can be differentiated as internal and external. The text states: when pure qi increases, dryness prevails. When the wind and wood are affected by pathogens, liver disease arises. This pertains to the influence of wind. Excess dryness leads to yin deficiency, and with yin deficiency, blood diminishes. Therefore, symptoms may manifest as pulling sensations, tightness, skin issues like wind rash, or internal organ dryness. These symptoms arise from yang transformation of dryness and insufficient nourishing qi damaging the internal organs, so treatment should primarily focus on nourishing yin and replenishing qi. </p>
<p>In the event that autumn is excessively severe, and the metallic energy prevails with accompanying wind, the lungs will be the first to be affected, which pertains to wind damage. When external cold binds the wind, the qi responds in the skin, leading to symptoms like body heat without sweating, cough, shortness of breath, nasal congestion, hoarseness, or a dry throat. In this case, dryness is caused by yin deficiency impacting the protective qi at the surface. Treatment should focus on light, warming dispersing remedies to warm the lungs and dispel cold.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo (Qing Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dryness Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>When dryness reaches its extreme and has already led to symptoms of stagnation, one may not be able to get out of bed; this is an untreatable condition. Stagnation refers to a fullness and distention in the sides, making it impossible to lie down on either side, and one cannot get out of bed. This condition arises from liver channel deficiency and dry stomach qi, and over time, it also exhausts kidney qi, leading to a lack of marrow in the bones, gradually resulting in atrophy. How can this be treated? This syndrome arises from the heat of summer, which burns out the lung&#39;s essence, preventing the generation of kidney water. Consequently, kidney water fails to nourish liver wood, wood cannot produce heart fire, and fire cannot generate spleen earth, thus causing stagnation. Therefore, by focusing on supporting the lungs and kidneys, while leaving the spleen and stomach to naturally recover. </p>
<p>The prescription is the Two Resources Decoction: 5 qian of Shan Zhuyu, 2 qian each of Bei Wuwei, and 1 liang each of Ren Shen, Bai Shao, Mai Dong, and Shu Di, decocted in water to be taken. Although this formula is called the Two Resources, it actually treats the kidney, liver, and lung channels simultaneously. The key is that by nourishing the lungs and kidneys, the source of their essence is established, and the dryness syndrome naturally becomes moistened. If the liver wood is not balanced, it will be difficult to generate stomach qi, and difficult to produce fluids and essence; thus, strong bones and the ability to walk, as well as a restful state for the sides, become hard to achieve.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Therefore, in the treatment of the kidneys and lungs, one must not neglect the sacred medicine for the liver. White peony is especially effective in pacifying the liver and can also nourish the blood. When used in the supplementation of the kidneys and lungs, it further enhances balance and works wonders. Long-term use naturally brings vitality, but one should not expect immediate results.</p>
<p>In cases of extreme dryness, where the body lacks flesh, the throat is dry, the face is dusty, and the body has no moisture while the soles of the feet feel hot, this is also not a treatable condition. Here, the blood is dry and cannot nourish from the outside, and essence is depleted and cannot provide internal moisture. I have an extraordinary formula that can save such cases, named Anrun Decoction: It consists of five qian each of Angelica sinensis, white peony, and Ophiopogon, one liang of prepared rehmannia, two qian of Chuanxiong, three qian each of Achyranthes bidentata and ginseng, and thirty pieces of mulberry leaves, boiled in water for consumption. This is a decoction of four ingredients with additional flavoring. </p>
<p>The brilliance lies in the addition of ginseng and mulberry leaves, making the formula even more nourishing, revitalizing all aspects of vital energy and blood, thus alleviating the suffering of dryness. </p>
<p>Dryness conditions often accompany fear, make it difficult to bend or stretch the waist, and are linked to hernias in men and abdominal pain in women, as well as protruding eyes. These are conditions that are not easily treated. However, I believe they can be treated, as all these symptoms are related to kidney issues.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Kidney deficiency can be replenished. When the kidneys are replenished, there is blood in the heart, which can stop shock; when the kidneys are replenished, there is essence in the waist, allowing for movement; when the kidneys are replenished, there is fluid in the Ren and Du channels, enabling men to eliminate hernias and women to alleviate pain. What worries are there about minor ailments like blindness or protruding eyes? </p>
<p>I now particularly pass on a formula called Capital Moistening Decoction: two taels of cooked rehmannia, thirty pieces of mulberry leaves, five qian of cornelian cherry, one tael each of sand ginseng and white atractylodes, three qian of sweet chrysanthemum, prepared in water for consumption. This formula solely replenishes the kidneys, with a slight addition to strengthen the spleen. Why is this? Dryness must lead to thirst, and thirst must lead to a lot of drinking; excessive water creates dampness in the waist and cannot be dispelled. White atractylodes is most beneficial for the lower abdomen, and combined with cooked rehmannia, which replenishes the kidneys, makes sure it is not too dry, thus assisting each other successfully. This is the brilliance of the formula. If faced with such ailments, using this formula has never resulted in failure.</p>
<p>Once the dryness disease is eliminated, the subsequent plan is to greatly replenish kidney water. When the water is sufficient, the lung&#39;s metal will be nourished, and then the Six Flavor Decoction, plus Mai Dong (Ophiopogon) and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandra), can be used for treatment.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>In treating conditions, one should not use cooling medicines, nor warming tonics, but rather employ neutral, balancing remedies, hence the term &quot;balancing treatment.&quot; These ailments stem from dryness of the lung qi. When the lung&#39;s metal qi becomes too dry, it poses unforeseen risks; if not treated urgently, it can lead to conditions like lung atrophy or lung abscess. Extreme dryness can generate heat, which ideally requires cooling medicines. Why not cooling medicines, you ask? The lungs are located in the upper part of the body; using cooling medicines might chill the lungs, or the medicine may not swiftly reach the lungs but instead affect the spleen and stomach. If the lung&#39;s heat is not cleared, the stomach might develop symptoms of vacuity and cold, leading to diarrhea. Prolonged diarrhea will deplete the stomach&#39;s vitality. If the stomach lacks vitality, how can it produce lung metal and nourish lung qi? Therefore, it is better to use neutral, balancing flavors to gently nourish the stomach and simultaneously clear the lung&#39;s metal qi. The prescription includes three qian of Yuanshen (literal translation: &quot;original ginseng&quot;), five qian of Mai Dong (ocean flower), one qian each of Jie Geng (platycodon root), Tian Men Dong (asparagus root), Gan Cao (licorice), Zi Wan (aster), Dong Hua (winter flower), Bei Mu (fritillaria), and Su Zi (perilla seed), boiled in water to take. This formula constitutes a purely neutral, balancing type of tonic and specifically targets the lung&#39;s metal qi. With long-term use, the stomach will not be cold, and the lung metal will be nourished; thus, conditions like lung atrophy and lung abscess will not arise. Therefore, if one has a prolonged cough, they should earnestly take this formula and must not be swayed by seasonal practitioners to use excessively cold medicines.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety&quot; states: A man named Dai visited his relative in the south of Cao, who was suffering from severe constipation. He had no other symptoms but was often afraid to eat fully, as this would make his bowel movements extremely difficult, with stools as hard as iron or stone, sometimes only occurring once every three to five days, accompanied by bleeding from the nose and pain in the rectum and large intestine. The pain was so intense that it caused dizziness. Taking medicine would worsen his condition; he had tried various drastic remedies, including croton seeds, cassia flowers, and others. If taken in excess, he felt lethargic, and stopping would return him to dryness. After several years of this, he grew fearful of the violent nature of the medicine and refused to take any, choosing instead to lie in bed awaiting the end.</p>
<p>When Dai visited, he examined the pulses in both hands, which were slippery yet strong. He administered a large dose of the Da Chengqi Decoction and followed up with Shen Gong Wan and Ma Ren Wan, instructing him to eat dishes made with water chestnuts, amaranth, and pig or sheep’s blood in soup. After more than a hundred days of this regimen, he regained strength, astonishing his family.</p>
<p>Alas! Coarse practitioners do not know that dryness can be of four kinds: external dryness causing the skin to crack and peel, internal dryness leading to a depletion of essence and blood, upper dryness resulting in a dry throat and nose, and lower dryness causing constipation in bowel movements. The condition of dryness arises from the yangming transforming, which is due to cold water and a deficiency of fluids. However, one can use purging methods, selecting remedies accordingly. For instance, croton seeds can purge cold, cassia and gardenia can purge dampness, and rhubarb and natron can purge dryness. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;Use acrid substances to moisten, and salty substances to soften.&quot; The &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; states: &quot;Use slippery substances to nourish the openings.&quot;<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>In the Eastern region, a woman suffered from severe constipation and dribbling urination, having been unable to conceive for half her life. Whenever she took laxatives, her constipation would relieve; however, it would recur if she stopped. Suddenly, she became pregnant, and around the fourth or fifth month, the doctor prohibited laxatives, making her bowel issues return. She strained greatly when trying to defecate, resulting in a miscarriage. This happened three times. Later, she became pregnant again at three or four months, experiencing urinary issues, and subsequently miscarried again. She then sought the advice of a healer.</p>
<p>The healer examined her pulse, finding it slippery and strong in both wrists. Although the pulse was strong, due to her pregnancy, he dared not use aggressive methods. Instead, he employed dietary therapy, making a broth with flower alkali and boiled wild taro greens, adding plantain seeds mixed with pig and sheep&#39;s blood. After half a year, she successfully gave birth, and her condition improved.</p>
<p>The healer remarked that he had often seen pregnant women suffer from bleeding due to excessively forcing, leading to miscarriages, yet treatment in this way had healed many without counting. Those who strictly adhere to traditional medical practices and do not adapt are not true physicians, nor true scholars. It is rare to find knowledgeable physicians; this is difficult to discuss.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Traditions&quot; states: My elder brother, Huai De, a recluse, aged forty-five, has always been thin and has had a low blood supply. During the year of Geng Zi, when metal was overly abundant, the autumn became particularly dry, leading to dryness illnesses. His skin cracked, his hands and feet became parched, itching caused flakes to rise, and painful bleeding occurred, yet he could not relieve the itch even with thickened nails. I prepared a prescription, named &quot;Blood Generating and Skin Moistening Drink,&quot; and after taking a few doses, his illness drastically improved. Subsequently, I treated over ten others with similar success.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

<p>Dryness overcomes wind.<br><strong>[Note: Dryness belongs to the metal qi of the west; in seasonal and five-element qi, there are interactions of mutual generation and mutual restraint.]</strong> The west generates dryness.<br><strong>[Note: The west governs the autumn&#39;s metal decree, hence its qi generates dryness.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Principles of Organ Qi and Seasonal Discussions</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys suffer from dryness; one should urgently eat spicy foods to moisten it. Opening the pores allows for the transmission of fluids and unblocks the qi.<br><strong>[Note: The kidneys are the water organ, favoring moisture and disliking dryness; thus, one should consume spices to moisten it, as spices can open the pores, facilitating the movement of fluids and unblocking qi, hence providing moisture.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Qi Convergence and Change</strong></p>
<p>When the annual metal is excessive, the dry qi flows, causing the liver wood to be harmed, resulting in the people suffering from pain in the lower abdomen and flanks, red and painful eyes, eye sores, and deafness; if the killing influence is severe, one feels body heaviness, chest pain radiating to the back, fullness and pain in the flanks and lower abdomen.<br><strong>[Note: When the annual metal is excessive and the dry qi flows, the liver wood is afflicted. Pain in the lower abdomen and flanks indicates liver disease. The liver opens to the eyes, hence the eye pain and sores. If the liver is weak, one may experience deafness. Heaviness of the body results from severe killing influence, lacking vital energy. Distress arises when the liver qi is stagnant and cannot flow.]</strong> When the annual wood is insufficient, dryness becomes predominant.<br><strong>[Note: When the seasonal qi is insufficient, it is overpowered and thus subjected to it. Therefore, when the wood movement of the year is insufficient, the metal’s dryness becomes predominant.]</strong><a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Great Discussion on the Five Constants and Governance</h3>
<p>To examine the year of balanced harmony, its command is dryness.<br><em>Note: The year of balanced harmony corresponds to the element of metal. In the heavens, it represents dryness, which reflects the command of metal.</em>  </p>
<p>In the year of firm completion, dryness governs its governance.<br><em>Note: The year of excessive metal corresponds to firm completion. Autumn is the season of harvest; thus, dryness governs its governance.</em>  </p>
<h3>The Great Discussion on the Six Origins and Correct Governance</h3>
<p>The governance of the sun and the heavens operates when the three energies are present; heavenly governance spreads, coolness comes forth, and dryness and heat intertwine, leading to extreme dryness and moisture, causing the people to suffer from cold and heat.<br><em>Note: The influence of metal energy comes down from heaven, thus the heavenly governance spreads and coolness manifests. The three dominant energies indicate the lesser yang fire, hence dryness and heat intertwine. The culmination of these energies transitions to the cold, wet earth of the fourth season, resulting in extreme dryness and moisture. The interplay of dryness, moisture, water, and fire causes the populace to suffer from cold afflictions.</em>  </p>
<p>The governance of the great yin and the heavens operates when the five energies are present; the dominance of moisture over dryness becomes stronger, heavy阴 energy manifests, cold energy affects the body, and wind and rain arise.<br><em>Note: The guest energy of the five corresponds to the great yin, damp earth, while the dominant energy reflects the sun&#39;s dry metal; therefore, moisture prevails over dryness. The heavy yin manifests with cold affecting the body, as both energies predominantly influence coolness. The arrival of the great yin concludes with rain, while the sun brings desolation, hence the advent of wind and rain.</em>  </p>
<p>When metal congestion occurs, dryness enables its governance. The people suffer from coughing, reverse flow, fullness in the chest and side, severe pain making it difficult to turn, dry throats, and a pale complexion.<br><em>Note: This indicates that the return of metal energy, when coupled with liver wood, leads to illness.</em>  <a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

The meridian section states: nausea with bitterness, frequent sighing, pain in the chest, unable to change sides, severe cases showing a dusty face and lack of bodily moisture, with feet feeling hot externally, indicative of a lesser Yang condition.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Spiritual Pivot: The Chapter on the Nine Palaces and Eight Winds</strong></p>
<p>The wind comes from the west and is called the Strong Wind. Its harm manifests internally in the lungs and externally on the skin. Its nature is to be drying. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Dryness</strong></p>
<p>Drought causes things to wither, to become dry and cracked, which is all related to dryness. The Yangming (Lung) is characterized by Dry Metal, which pertains to the energies of the lungs and large intestine. When something is dry, it becomes sluggish; when moist, it becomes smooth and supple. Thus, dryness and moisture are opposed. When the body is entirely dry and sluggish, it is related to the transformation of Dry Metal, hence autumn is characterized by dryness. </p>
<p>Conditions such as numbness can also arise from dryness, caused by a deficiency of fluid leading to dryness and stagnation, obstructing the smooth flow of energy. Strong forces that invade can lead to numbness as well. However, the six energies do not necessarily act independently in causing illness; they can combine. For instance, if fluids are lost leading to dryness or numbness without heat signs, one should use herbs like Wufu (Piper) to clear the pathways for beneficial flow. </p>
<p>If wind and heat prevail over dampness leading to dryness, one should dispel the wind, disperse the heat, invigorate the blood, nourish the fluids, and use cool herbs to alleviate dryness—then numbness can heal. This principle applies to all cases of dryness and stagnation. </p>
<p>Withering signifies a lack of nourishment. Drought signifies an absence of fluids.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Dryness does not bring moisture. Rigor is not gentle. The oppositions of spring and autumn and the differences of dryness and moisture are the reasons for this. The great principle: external heat manifests as heat on the surface, while thirst for water indicates internal heat. When the body is warm and one drinks water, both external and internal are heated; when the body is cool and not thirsty, both external and internal have no heat. Therefore, the classics do not take fire to alleviate thirst, stating that thirst is not only caused by heat. For instance, in cases of illness from cold leading to vomiting or diarrhea, excessive loss of fluids can also cause dryness and thirst. Even if illness presents with wind-heat but the fluids have not yet diminished, there may still be no thirst. Can one say that thirst is only caused by heat and not by cold? The condition of dry thirst is often accompanied by heat, hence the Yi says: &quot;What dries all things, nothing is more intense than fire.&quot; Thus, when stating that thirst is due to dryness, this encompasses all aspects. As for the principle that when the body is cool and there is no thirst, it indicates that both external and internal lack heat, hence it is not described as cold.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is said that if there is a slight warmth inside and out, there may also be a body that is not hot yet does not feel thirsty; this cannot be inappropriate. Cracking and peeling refer to the skin’s rifts. The dry corresponds to heaven and represents dry metal, while the wet corresponds to earth and represents damp soil. Heaven and earth are opposites, and dry and wet have different functions. Thus, dry metal governs tightness and contraction, so autumn pulses are tight, fine, and subtle; while wet soil governs relaxation and expansion, leading to the June pulse being relaxed, large, and long. When the earth is moist, it is relaxed, smooth, and slippery; when dry, it is tight, constricted, and parched; the principle of cracking and peeling is clearly observable. It is commonly said that cracking and peeling are due to wind, as wind can overcome moisture and cause dryness. The classics state that the jue yin point is where the wind resides, leading to cracks; thus, the wind prevails over moisture and causes dryness. The saying that the cold months are severe while the hot months decline is because cold can gather and constrict, closing the pores tight, leading to no sweat and dryness, thus intensifying illness.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When heat prevails, the skin becomes relaxed, the pores open and sweat moistens, thus leading to illness and debilitation. If one experiences dryness and cracking due to water dampness on the skin, it is because water dampness invites wind and cold. </p>
<p>Excessive heat overcomes dryness, as dryness arises from metal, while heat transforms. When metal is abundant, it is restrained by fire; if the lungs are deficient, they are treated with bitterness. It is also said that the energy of metal is below, while the energy of fire supports it. When internal dryness prevails, it is treated with warm bitterness and assisted with sweet and pungent flavors to descend the bitterness. If lung energy ascends and reverses, quickly consume bitter to release it. </p>
<p>Wang notes that to restrain the excessive dryness, it must be done with warm bitterness; therefore, dry and withered conditions arise from this ailment. Hence, metal governs in autumn and belongs to yin, its energy being cool. When this coolness is extreme, the weather becomes clear and all things become dry, thus dryness resembles fire, indicating metal has reached its peak and now involves fiery transformation, leading to the ailment of depleted blood and fluids. When dryness of metal is extreme, it causes vexation, heat stagnation, and weakness of limbs, which cannot grasp or hold. </p>

Therefore, the skin becomes cracked and dry, and when severe, it can cause numbness and paralysis. Those who are desiccated have little water and much fire. As stated in the &quot;Xi Ci&quot; (a text in the &quot;I Ching&quot;): nothing dries living things more than fire. Hence, when fire is extremely hot, moisture is depleted and fails to hydrate the body, causing the skin to crack, and the hands and feet to suffer deep wounds as if struck by an axe. This condition is worse in winter and less severe in summer. Thus, the principle states: cold can gather and constrict, which leads to dryness and cracking; heat can relax and expand, which results in nourishing and moisturizing. All of these belong to the transformation of dry metal. The commentary notes: living things are moist and smooth, while dead things are dry and withered.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

All ailments stem from the ways of the five elements and the balance of the six Qi, through victory and restoration, as well as the alternation between prosperity and decline. Wang Zhu commented: Life has form, and one cannot be without afflictions. Once there are afflictions, there are also means of escape and transformation, manifesting beyond Yin and Yang. Thus, it is said: Carefully guard against the mechanisms of illness, each attending to their own domain. Some seek treatment, others don’t; some are criticized for being excessive, while others are criticized for being deficient. One must first ensure the dominance of the five elements, unclog the blood and Qi to achieve harmony and peace. This is what is meant. </p>
<p>Dryness and desiccation are the basis of the metal lung; the lung stores air, for when blood damages the internal Qi, or in the presence of wind, it leads to fatigue.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Dryness and dampness are indeed different. Though dry metal belongs to the autumnal yin, its nature differs from that of cold dampness, as dry yin prevails over the warmth of wind, heat, and fire. Therefore, when wind and heat are strong, they can similarly lead to dryness alongside cold dampness. Furthermore, internal cold may cause vomiting and diarrhea, depleting fluids and resulting in dryness, which is also explained by this principle. Hence, the classics state: all that is withered, dried up, or cracking belongs to dryness. </p>
<p>Dryness is the root of the metal-lung; dry metal transforms into dryness and withering upon receiving heat. Accompanied by heat, it leads to a weakening of metal, depleting fluids and diminishing blood, causing stagnation that results in dryness. Thus, the classics say: wind, heat, and fire all belong to yang; cold, dampness, and dryness all belong to yin. Moreover, dryness and dampness are also distinct. Although dry metal belongs to autumnal yin, its nature is different from cold dampness, and in fact, it aligns more with wind, heat, and fire.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Dryness</strong></p>
<p>Dryness causes stasis of blood, which cannot nourish and moisten; thus, it is necessary to nourish yin. The five flavors nourish the organs, while thirst due to yang concerns relates to the large intestine, which governs expulsion without retention. Now, if there is accumulation and obstruction, why is it unable to be resolved? This has its reasons. If pathogens invade internally, the stomach has dry feces; if there is heat in the three burners, bodily fluids are dried up, hence the large intestine harbors heat. In those with deficiency, the organs are cold and blood vessels are desiccated; in the elderly, the organs are cold and the pathways of qi are obstructed, thus the large intestine harbors cold. There are also cases of the intestines and stomach being affected by wind, leading to dryness and difficulty in excretion—this condition arises from accumulated wind and qi. If qi does not descend and the pathway for food becomes difficult, with nausea and fullness, there will certainly be corresponding symptoms. </p>
<p>When the skin cracks and splits, leading to severe pain and possible blood loss, or if the skin is dry and itchy, it is indicative of fire damaging the lung metal, which is extreme dryness.

<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: all that is withered, dry, and parched belongs to dryness. The &quot;Original Disease Formulas&quot; indicates: the classics say that wind, heat, and fire are all Yang, while cold, dryness, and dampness are all Yin. Moreover, although dryness and dampness are slightly different, dry metal, though belonging to the autumn Yin, differs from cold dampness. Therefore, it is akin to wind and heat. Thus, when fire and heat are excessive, metal weakens and wind arises, because wind can overcome dampness and heat can consume fluids, leading to a condition where Yang is strong and Yin is deficient. As a result, wind and heat surpass water and dampness, causing dryness. In general, people suffering from wind diseases often have this condition due to excessive heat and dryness, with heat as the dominant factor. The liver governs the tendons, and when the wind is excessive, and dryness and heat are added, the tendons become overly dry. Dry metal governs contraction; its pulses are tight and constrained, resulting in injuries to the tendons making them tense and leading to a stiff mouth.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

All these symptoms originate from excess heat creating dry wind, with each illness being different because of varying degrees of wind-heat dryness. The so-called &quot;wind-stroke with loose tendons&quot; occurs when wind-heat prevails over dampness and leads to excessive dryness. Hence, when the tendons are loose and not retracted, it results in weakness and paralysis, thus conditions such as fullness and stagnation that lead to weakness relate to the lung&#39;s metal element, which is dryness transformed. Just as in deep autumn when dryness is excessive, plants wither and do not bear fruit, reflecting the symptoms of illness.

<p><strong>Drought: Internal and External Factors</strong></p>
<p>External Causes: When the season of Yangming drought arrives, prolonged sunny weather without rain leads to yellow dust blocking the sky, causing confusion and madness in people, and skin becomes dry and scaly. Internal Causes: The seven emotions can generate heat and dryness, or constipation can lead to loss of body fluids, or dryness from metal and stone affects the blood, or overexertion in intimate relations can deplete essence, or disruptions from hunger, fullness, or fatigue harm the stomach, or consuming excessively roasted, alcoholic, thick-flavored foods can all intensify the fire evil, consuming and scorching the blood. </p>
<p>The six Qi: Wind, heat, and fire belong to Yang; cold, dryness, and dampness belong to Yin. Although dryness is linked to the autumn Yin, it negatively interacts with wind, heat, and fire. When the fire is vigorous, the metal is harmed by heat, wood cannot regulate and gives rise to wind, wind overcomes dampness, and heat diminishes body fluids. When it enters the liver, it causes the muscles and tendons to tighten and become stiff, leading to conditions like muscle spasm or paralysis of hands and feet, or numbness in the fingers making it impossible to scratch an itch, or causing visual impairments. When it enters the heart, it causes fainting, rigidity, and slurred speech; entering the spleen leads to fullness and a lack of appetite, or extreme hunger resulting in thinness, or causing stagnation that transforms into abdominal swelling; when it enters the lungs, it leads to dry skin and coughs; when it reaches the kidneys, it depletes fluids leading to thirst and bone steaming with secretive blockages. Overall, all these conditions relate to the lung metal, corresponding closely to the Yangming and the lungs.</p>
<p>For external ailments such as skin dryness and scaling, modify the Si Wu Decoction by removing Chuanxiong and combining it with Sheng Mai San while adding Zhimu, Bohe, and tianhuafen, or simply use tiandimenggao. If there&#39;s muscle spasm resulting in immobility, prescribe Daqin Jiao Decoction. For internal illnesses like diabetes, employ formulas that activate blood, moisten dryness, and generate fluids.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Dryness arises from the overactivity of the liver&#39;s wood element, or from wind entering the large intestine, termed &quot;wind dryness&quot;; for this, use Soothing Wind and Regulating Qi Pill. If it is due to heat accumulation in the organs or long-standing illness with stagnant heat, it is called &quot;heat dryness&quot;; for this, use Si Shun Qing Liang Drink or Dang Gui Long Hui Pill. If it is from hidden fire in the spleen and stomach leading to constipation and loss of appetite, it is termed &quot;blood dryness&quot;; for this, use Si Wu Decoction plus Da Huang and Tao Ren, or take it in pill form; for constipation, use Dao Zhi Tong You Decoction; for dysuria, use Dao Qi Chu Zao Decoction. If there is yin deficiency with fire dryness, it is termed &quot;deficiency dryness&quot;; for this, use Dan Huang Bo Pill, Bu Yin Pill, or Shen Qi Pill. For those who are exhausted and have qi deficiency and dryness, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. Generally, modify Si Wu Decoction by removing Chuanxiong, with Tian Men Dong and Mai Dong as the main ingredients, (Cao She) Lou as an assistant, and Sheng Ma, Hong Hua, and Gan Cao as aides. Add Qin Jiao or Niu Xi for wind-related issues, Huang Qin for heat-related problems, increase Di Huang for blood conditions, Tian Hua Fen and Wu Wei Zi for thirst, Da Huang, (Mu Yu) Li Ren, and Ma Ren for constipation, and increase Ren Shen and Huang Qi for qi deficiency, or add Zhi Mu and Huang Bo for yin deficiency. In general, it is advisable to use sweet, cool, and moistening agents, and to avoid pungent and aromatic herbs that stir up fire, as well as any diaphoretics. The classics state: &quot;To alleviate dryness, moisten it; this is called nourishing blood.&quot; For when dryness occurs, the blood thickens and the qi and fluids become stagnant; moisture encourages blood vitality and promotes the unblocking of qi and fluids, leading to a flourishing internal spirit and external radiance. Accumulated fluids can generate qi, and accumulated qi can produce fluids. For those with qi deficiency, use Qiong Yu Gao; for those with fluid deficiency, use Dan Wu Wei Zi Gao; for blood deficiency, use Di Huang Gao. Whenever illness encounters dryness from the environment, it is advisable to increase these moistening agents. </p>

<p>　　燥之与湿，有霄壤之殊。燥者，天之气也；湿者，地之气也。水流湿，火就燥，各从其类，此胜彼负，两不相侔。春月地气动而湿胜，斯草木畅茂；秋月天气肃而燥胜，斯草木黄落。故春分以后之湿，秋分以后之燥，各司其政。今指秋月之燥为湿，是必指夏月之热为寒然后可。奈何《内经》病机一十九条，独遗燥气，他凡秋伤于燥，皆谓秋伤于湿。历代诸贤，随文作解，弗察其讹，昌特正之。大意谓春伤于风，夏伤于暑，长夏伤于湿，秋伤于燥，冬伤于寒，觉六气配四时之旨，与五运不相背戾，而千古之大疑，始一抉也。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On Autumn Drought</h3>
<p>The distinction between dryness and humidity is like the difference between heaven and earth. Dryness is the essence of heaven; humidity is the essence of earth. Water flows with humidity, while fire corresponds to dryness; each follows its nature, where one conquers the other, and they do not balance. In spring, the energy of the earth stirs and humidity prevails, allowing plants to flourish; in autumn, the energy of heaven is austere and dryness prevails, causing plants to yellow and fall. Thus, the humidity after the spring equinox and the dryness after the autumn equinox each have their own role. </p>
<p>Now, to refer to the dryness of the autumn moon as humidity must imply that the heat of the summer months is understood as cold for it to make sense. However, the Inner Canon lists nineteen causes of disease but omits dry air, while all other mentions of autumn injuries refer to injuries from humidity. Scholars of all ages have interpreted the text literally without discerning this error, so it is imperative to correct it. The general understanding suggests that spring is injured by wind, summer by heat, late summer by humidity, autumn by dryness, and winter by cold, aligning with the principles of the six energies corresponding to the four seasons and not contradicting the cycles of five movements; thus, the great doubts of the ages finally begin to unravel.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>然则秋燥可无论乎？夫秋不遽燥也，大热之后，继以凉生，凉生而热解，渐至大凉而燥令乃行焉。经谓阳明所至，始为燥，终为凉者，亦误文也。岂有新秋月华露湛，星润渊澄，天香遍野，万宝垂实，归之燥政，迨至山空月小，水落石出，天降繁霜，地凝白卤，一往坚急劲切之化，反谓凉生，不谓燥乎？或者疑燥从火化，故先燥而后凉，此非理也。深乎！《上古脉要》曰：春不沉，夏不弦，秋不数，冬不濇，是谓四塞。谓脉之从四时者，不循序渐进，则四塞而不通也。所以春夏秋冬孟月之脉，仍循冬春夏秋季月之常，不改其度。<a id="orig-20p" href="#trans-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Can autumn dryness be disregarded? Autumn does not become dry hastily; it follows great heat and then is accompanied by coolness. When coolness arises, heat dissipates, gradually leading to greater coolness and the onset of dryness. The scripture states that where the Yangming reaches, it first brings dryness and ultimately results in coolness, which is a misinterpretation. Is it possible that amidst the new autumn&#39;s moonlight and dew sparkling, the stars shimmering over serene depths, the fragrance of heaven pervading the fields, the myriad treasures bearing fruit, dryness is the cause? Until the mountains are empty, the moon is small, the waters recede revealing the stones, the heavens release abundant frost, and the earth solidifies into white salt, such a transformation that seems harsh and urgent should be regarded as the onset of coolness, not dryness. Some may doubt that dryness stems from fire, thus suggesting it is dry first and then cool; this reasoning lacks merit. Indeed! The &quot;Essentials of Ancient Pulses&quot; states: Spring does not sink, summer does not straighten, autumn does not number, winter does not clog; this is called the four blockages. It indicates that if the pulse of the seasons does not follow a gradual progression, it becomes blocked and unable to circulate. Thus, the pulses of the months in spring, summer, autumn, and winter should still adhere to the established norms of the respective months of winter, spring, summer, and autumn, without alteration.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>After the double division and double arrival, one begins to turn towards the royal energy of the original decree, thus forming the pulse of ordinary people. Therefore, the heavenly way does not separate and does not warm in spring, nor reaches but does not heat in summer; the movement of nature is long-lasting and boundless. If in the pulse of humans, spring corresponds with strings, and summer corresponds with numbers, haste and urgency add up, not three seasons and the year finishes, how can it last for long? Indeed, this is the reason why in autumn, the moon is avoided in the number of pulses, because the new autumn is vanquished by dryness, hence it is to be avoided. If a person is not ill, and in the new autumn has a pulse with slight numbers, this is the genuine pulse of heaven, why then should it be avoided? Furthermore, initial dryness leads to cooling, and when cooling occurs, it should naturally turn to cold; why then does it return to warmth in October? When cooling returns to warmth, the order of time is lost; does not the heavenly way stagnate? Not understanding that the warmth of October does not turn from cooling, it actually arises from dryness. Below the position of metal, the energy of fire supports it, therefore early winter is often warm. The response of the pulse still derives from the dryness of metal.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From the moist to the stagnant, its moisture is the gold of living water, and its stagnation is indeed the gold in water. The brilliance of pearls and the luster of jade, could they harm dryness? Yet, the coolness of early autumn serves to ward off the summer heat, and the heat suffered during summer is indeed released by the coolness. The classics say: when one sweats not during heat, autumn brings forth wind-epidemics. One epidemics, and all who take coolness through the wind and use water to wash away sweat, until sweat is no more and harm is done within, will have illnesses arising like those treated in the case of epidemics. Internal harm resulting from cold stagnation may also be compared to epidemics. Since their origin is all the pathogenic dampness of summer, despite the different external and internal dominions, they all arise from the autumn wind. However, when we speak of deep autumn&#39;s dry metal dominating ailments, it is quite different. The classics state: dryness overcomes, therefore it is dry. The harms of dryness are not merely vast, barren lands. There is dryness externally causing chapping; there is dryness internally exhausting essence and blood; there is dryness in bodily fluids causing a decline in protective energy, with flesh scorched and skin adhering to bones. Each illness is affected by the larger channels and smaller collaterals, related to their respective top, bottom, middle, outside, front, and back. Where dryness prevails, it is also called burning. As for the injuries, they are even more severe.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The dryness of metal injures, primarily harming the liver wood; if severe, it can even lead to self-harm of the lung metal. The lung metal is responsible for qi and regulates the circulatory pathways. This situation only arises with metal born from earth, which is strong and unyielding, thus allowing for freedom in life and death, maintaining order without disorder. If the illness arises in autumn and is caused by dryness, the metal suffers from the punishment of fire, transforming its rigidity into softness, becoming round and compliant to shape, desiring to retain its previous clarity and solemnity—how can this be achieved?</p>
<p>Classically, it is stated that persistent coughs resulting in white blood signify death; this white blood is described as light red, resembling flesh or lung. If there is no self-consumption of the lung metal, how could this occur? Consider the essence of grasses and trees which can be gathered; when exposed to the essence of metal, it suddenly alters its appearance, scorching its upper part, while the dry qi first harms the upper burner. Isn’t this clear?</p>
<p>Upon thorough examination, all the pathogenic qi related to lung issues relates to the lung; conditions such as weakness, shortness of breath, and vomiting all pertain to the upper part. These two lines distinctly illustrate the dryness-related illnesses. The theory of living qi ascending to the heavens states: autumn harms through dryness, leads to upward rebellion and cough, resulting in weakness and collapse. The essence of dry illness, succinctly stated, aligns perfectly with the two aspects of pathogenic mechanism.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The misunderstanding of dryness as dampness has led to confusion in the principles of treatment. Thus, I will discuss the nature of dryness so that its definition is clear. Symptoms of dryness include pain in the left side, inability to turn over, a dry throat, a dusty face, lack of moisture in the body, heat in the feet, lower back pain, muscle spasms, hernias in men, abdominal pain in women, and eye problems. These signs indicate that dryness originates in the liver and manifests in various ways. According to the Inner Canon, dryness is overcome by moisture, and its treatment must involve bitter and cold remedies to counteract its supremacy. If the condition requires supplementation, one should add sour elements; if it requires purging, then add pungent elements. When administering laxatives, the use of bitter and warm substances is advised. If excessive cold is present, then cold laxatives should be avoided in favor of warm ones. Even when there is excess energy, one should only use pungent purgatives, not cold ones. It is essential to understand that the metal (lung) element fears heat, while dryness also fears cold. Thus, remedies that are neutral to cold and supplemented with bitter and sweet are ideal. A harmonious balance of hot and cold is the best approach to treatment.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, when encountering the lower descending Qi of the six energies, it is advisable to make slight changes accordingly. For instance, when fire Qi is underneath gold, it is necessary to reduce the attributes of bitterness and warmth, for fear that fire may strengthen fire. When using these methods, one should also transform bitterness and warmth to align with the cooling nature. This reflects the essence of treating dryness and excess from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and could be endorsed as a principle.</p>
<p>As for lung Qi being oppressed, causing weakness, wheezing, vomiting, and coughing, these are serious ailments caused by intense dryness, and cannot be resolved by a single method of treatment. Therefore, it is included under the category of dryness and should be carefully deliberated for effective treatment. Scholars should diligently seek understanding in this area, and they will inevitably find success. If one only uses moistening to treat dryness without considering the condition of the illness or its suitability to the symptoms, it would still be coarse and inadequate.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Bi&quot; states: Yin Qi, when still, preserves the spirit; when agitated, it dissipates. Below, it merely notes that excessive eating harms the intestines and stomach, and does not pertain to the lungs. The reasons for agitation and the dissipation of Yin Qi have been touched upon but not fully explored. As the &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; mentions, exposure to cold drinks harms the lungs, establishing that lung injury is related to cold.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It can be seen that the lung Qi manifests outwardly through the skin and hair, and internally it travels through the waterways. When exposed to cold, the external chill enters through the skin; when drinking cold, the cold water rises from the chest, restricting the lung Qi and preventing it from spreading outward and descending. This stagnation disrupts its regulation, resulting in the body&#39;s Qi being unable to rise and support the lungs, leading to lung disease. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the lungs are delicate organs; about 20-30% suffer from cold damage, while 70-80% are harmed by heat. Cold mainly constricts the exterior, while heat consumes within, causing more severe harm. When the lungs are injured by heat, it results in stagnant Qi, leading to various symptoms like weakness, coughing, and vomiting, resulting in dryness. </p>
<p>Most herbal formulas, such as those containing Wu Yao, Xiang Fu, Zi Su, Ban Xia, Fu Ling, Hou Po, Ding, Chen, He, Gao, Jiang, Gui, Peng, Ling, Bing Lang, and Yi Zhi, follow traditional patterns. This is due to the &quot;Nei Jing&quot; neglecting dry symptoms, leading later practitioners to mistakenly treat dryness with dryness, being complacent in their methods and ignoring the depletion of Yin Qi. </p>

If lung qi is not dry, then the various qi can be clear and dispersive, circulating throughout the body; how then could there be stagnation? The conditions of weakness, coughing, and vomiting that pertain to the upper jiao refer to the lungs and not the heart.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The scripture initially states that when faced with autumn’s chilling qi, the Taiyin cannot absorb it. It discusses the condition of the lungs being filled with heat and whether this can be called a damp disease. Further examination of Dongyuan’s treatment for lung consumption shows the use of cardamom and bitter herbs, along with aromatic and qi-regulating medicines, indicating a lack of awareness regarding the harm of dryness. </p>
<p>Moreover, Danxi’s eclectic approach, which later generations have adopted, does not suggest any single method concerning lung dryness. In the discussion of the heat-accumulating decoction, it mentions that some cases arise from yin deficiency and others from gastric weakness due to consuming cold food, which restrains the yang qi within the spleen. The treatment methods are seen in the fever-related sections.</p>
<p>This treatment is neither for yin deficiency, nor for yang collapse, nor does it indicate fever, yet the persistent steam-like feeling remains unresolved. Such persistence may imply that the lung qi is internally steamed by heat, unable to express outwardly. Thus, a formula is constructed using eight ingredients: forsythia, mint, scutellaria, gardenia seeds, ophiopogon, licorice, curcuma, and bamboo leaves as a guide. </p>
<p>Afterwards, it poses a question regarding the absence of actions involving angelica and cyperus. The response is that fire exacerbates dryness, and drying medicines can facilitate fire; therefore, they are not used. This formula indicates a reluctance to use drying agents that amplify heat in the context of heat accumulation, suggesting a cautious avoidance of further damaging the lung’s metal element, as can be subtly inferred.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, it is also clever and coincidental, yet there has yet to be a discovery that can treat internal dryness but cannot address external dryness, let alone the effects of wind, cold, heat, and humidity. One should select the beneficial aspects. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: when the heart moves heat to the lungs, it results in dysphoria. The source of lung dryness is quite distant! If a person&#39;s kidney water is sufficient and ascends to engage with the heart, then the heart fire descends to connect with the kidney, and does not transmit to the lungs. If the heart fire does not affect the lungs, then how could there be concerns about dryness? Even if the kidney water appears insufficient, the fluids and blood in the intestines and stomach are enough to support upward, so the lungs would not suffer excess harm. If, however, the lower moisture is completely depleted, but the high source of water is still able to remain without spilling, then there would certainly be no matter at all. Therefore, the scriptures further state: &quot;The two yangs connected are referred to as dysphoria.&quot; The hand yangming large intestine experiences heat accumulation where fluids do not moisten, and the foot yangming stomach has heat accumulation where blood is not nourished, leading to the formation of thirst syndrome, with a red and cracked tongue and extreme thirst prompting drinking. This is related to the heart transferring heat to the lungs, resulting in dysphoria; though the wording is different, the meaning is the same. To treat dysphoria, use the White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng to support the lungs, alleviating various symptoms such as qi stagnation, weakness, cough, and vomiting; all will be addressed accordingly.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Can scholars not draw analogies and broaden their understanding in pursuit of this path? The discussion of Yin and Yang states: When both Yang conditions affect the heart and spleen, there are hidden obstacles; for men, there is a deficiency of essence, and for women, a lack of menstrual flow. This results in conditions such as &quot;wind consumption&quot; or &quot;breath and oppression,&quot; which lead to death if untreated. This also arises from dryness in the lungs, which has not yet been uncovered. Dryness diminishes male essence and produces deficiencies in female fluids, leading to severe conditions. Initially, this primarily affects concealed matters. Subsequently, the dryness of the stomach transfers to the spleen, resulting in &quot;wind consumption.&quot; &quot;Wind consumption&quot; refers to the heat of wind causing depletion of muscle and flesh. The dryness in the large intestine moves to the lungs, resulting in &quot;breath and oppression.&quot; &quot;Breath and oppression&quot; refers to breath that flows upward without descending. Thus, the intestines and stomach, along with the heart and spleen, contribute to the dryness of the lung&#39;s metal element. When the three organs and two bowels suffer from such a depletion of Yin energy, is there still hope for treatment? The heart and lungs have already succumbed to the realm of death&#39;s Yin. However, the spleen disperses the essence of the two Yangs upward to the lungs, still allowing for some slight recovery.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Now, the harm of dryness causes those who give life to turn completely to seek my life, hence the direct diagnosis is death without treatment. Previously, I was confused, but now I clarify. </p>
<p>The nineteenth clause of the disease mechanism states: all drought, withered and drained, dryness of energy and cracked skin, all belong to dryness. Although dry metal is associated with autumn and belongs to the yin channels, it differs from cold dampness and resembles fire heat. When fire heat dominates, metal weakens; when fire heat prevails, wind becomes fierce. Wind can overcome dampness, and heat can consume fluids, turning the situation into a manifestation of excess yang and deficiency of yin, hence the qi of wind, fire, and heat overcomes water and earth, resulting in dryness.</p>
<p>The liver governs the tendons. When wind qi prevails, combined with dryness and heat, fluids accumulate in the chest and diaphragm, failing to nourish the tendons, which leads to dryness in the tendons. Thus, they become rigid and tense, resulting in a closed mouth, or possibly convulsions, fainting, stiffness, and collapse. </p>
<p>When wind and heat are excessively dry, causing stagnation on the surface while the internal qi is balanced, they stretch and contract inappropriately, with the tendons feeling tight, accompanied by occasional chills or spasms. The pulse is rapid and tense. However, if wind, heat, and dryness combine with severe internal stagnation, it will surely lead to distressing fullness and blockage, indicating that dryness discriminates between external and internal qi and blood.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

The metal element transforms through dryness, and the lungs themselves suffer, leading to a gradual decline in lung qi; what more can be said about weakness and paralysis?</p>
<p>The five organs and their corresponding emotions are nourished by true fluids, thus remaining still and unchanging. True fluids, in particular, rely on the kidney&#39;s yin essence and the stomach&#39;s fluid, which flow together without ceasing. If the water from the kidney and stomach is not replenished, the true yin of the five organs will be depleted, causing the fires of the five emotions to stir within, resulting in the diseases of the three areas of upper, middle, and lower.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There is thirst due to heart and lung deficiency, liver stagnation, spleen heat, kidney heat, and excessive heat in the stomach and intestines. Thirst may also arise from illness such as malaria, from indulging in rich foods, from drunkenness and overindulgence, from the fatigue of long journeys in the heat, from injury to the stomach due to dryness, or from wind. The five organs are affected differently, and the conditions they encounter vary, but the result is the same: dryness and heat lead to the loss of fluids. </p>
<p>To treat dryness-related diseases, one should nourish the kidney’s water and cool the deficient yin, while purging the excess fire from the heart and alleviating the severe dryness and heat in the intestines, thereby replenishing the fluids in the stomach. This ensures that pathways are unobstructed, fluids are generated and not depleted, and that qi and blood flow freely, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>The kidneys dislike dryness, so one should quickly consume spicy foods to moisten them. The kidneys govern the five fluids; if they are full, then defecation remains normal. However, if one experiences hunger, fullness, overexertion, or consumes overly spicy and heavy foods, it can exacerbate the fire evil, depleting true yin and causing a deficiency in fluids, leading to dry stools. </p>
<p>Zhongjing stated: if a person has slight diarrhea but constipated stools, one should not forcibly purge it; instead, use pills to moisten the spleen. Be cautious of excessive purging, which can severely damage the fluids.

<p>It is noted that the various forms of Qi stagnation related to the lungs are due to dryness in the lungs. Historically and in modern times, treatments for Qi stagnation use pungent and aromatic herbs to promote Qi flow, but there has been no method aimed specifically at treating lung dryness. Conditions like weakness, coughing, and vomiting that pertain to the upper body are also linked to lung dryness. Yet, treatments have classified weakness and vomiting under the Yangming channel, and coughing under the lung, which means that vomiting and weakness are classified among the middle and lower parts, while coughing is placed in the upper. Therefore, among countless prescriptions, there isn&#39;t a single one that addresses lung dryness. Even with coughs related to the lung, treatments tend to either release the exterior, drain downward, or promote Qi movement. Occasionally, there are a few prescriptions that use moistening agents, but they fail to address the root cause effectively.

Although Asparagus root can protect the lungs, it is bitter and can cause qi stagnation, which may harm the stomach and obstruct phlegm, so it is not used. Similarly, Rehmannia can nourish kidney water and clear lung metal, but it is also bitter and thus not used. Regarding bitter cold herbs that lower fire, they are especially to be avoided. Indeed, the lung metal succumbs to dryness, and the remaining yin essence is just a thin thread. If further bitter cold herbs are used to lower qi, it will damage the stomach; can the person still have vitality?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Complete Text of Jingyue</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jiebin)</p>
<p><strong>The Difference Between Internal and External Dryness</strong></p>
<p>Although dryness is also a type of external pathogen, it contains both yin and yang aspects. The yang aspect is associated with heat, while the yin aspect arises from cold. Heat damages yin, which is necessarily linked to the organs; cold damages yang, which is necessarily linked to the channels. This is why it is important to discern and treat the internal and external manifestations. </p>
<p>The signs of dryness can be differentiated as internal and external. The text states: when pure qi increases, dryness prevails. When the wind and wood are affected by pathogens, liver disease arises. This pertains to the influence of wind. Excess dryness leads to yin deficiency, and with yin deficiency, blood diminishes. Therefore, symptoms may manifest as pulling sensations, tightness, skin issues like wind rash, or internal organ dryness. These symptoms arise from yang transformation of dryness and insufficient nourishing qi damaging the internal organs, so treatment should primarily focus on nourishing yin and replenishing qi. </p>
<p>In the event that autumn is excessively severe, and the metallic energy prevails with accompanying wind, the lungs will be the first to be affected, which pertains to wind damage. When external cold binds the wind, the qi responds in the skin, leading to symptoms like body heat without sweating, cough, shortness of breath, nasal congestion, hoarseness, or a dry throat. In this case, dryness is caused by yin deficiency impacting the protective qi at the surface. Treatment should focus on light, warming dispersing remedies to warm the lungs and dispel cold.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo (Qing Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dryness Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>When dryness reaches its extreme and has already led to symptoms of stagnation, one may not be able to get out of bed; this is an untreatable condition. Stagnation refers to a fullness and distention in the sides, making it impossible to lie down on either side, and one cannot get out of bed. This condition arises from liver channel deficiency and dry stomach qi, and over time, it also exhausts kidney qi, leading to a lack of marrow in the bones, gradually resulting in atrophy. How can this be treated? This syndrome arises from the heat of summer, which burns out the lung&#39;s essence, preventing the generation of kidney water. Consequently, kidney water fails to nourish liver wood, wood cannot produce heart fire, and fire cannot generate spleen earth, thus causing stagnation. Therefore, by focusing on supporting the lungs and kidneys, while leaving the spleen and stomach to naturally recover. </p>
<p>The prescription is the Two Resources Decoction: 5 qian of Shan Zhuyu, 2 qian each of Bei Wuwei, and 1 liang each of Ren Shen, Bai Shao, Mai Dong, and Shu Di, decocted in water to be taken. Although this formula is called the Two Resources, it actually treats the kidney, liver, and lung channels simultaneously. The key is that by nourishing the lungs and kidneys, the source of their essence is established, and the dryness syndrome naturally becomes moistened. If the liver wood is not balanced, it will be difficult to generate stomach qi, and difficult to produce fluids and essence; thus, strong bones and the ability to walk, as well as a restful state for the sides, become hard to achieve.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, in the treatment of the kidneys and lungs, one must not neglect the sacred medicine for the liver. White peony is especially effective in pacifying the liver and can also nourish the blood. When used in the supplementation of the kidneys and lungs, it further enhances balance and works wonders. Long-term use naturally brings vitality, but one should not expect immediate results.</p>
<p>In cases of extreme dryness, where the body lacks flesh, the throat is dry, the face is dusty, and the body has no moisture while the soles of the feet feel hot, this is also not a treatable condition. Here, the blood is dry and cannot nourish from the outside, and essence is depleted and cannot provide internal moisture. I have an extraordinary formula that can save such cases, named Anrun Decoction: It consists of five qian each of Angelica sinensis, white peony, and Ophiopogon, one liang of prepared rehmannia, two qian of Chuanxiong, three qian each of Achyranthes bidentata and ginseng, and thirty pieces of mulberry leaves, boiled in water for consumption. This is a decoction of four ingredients with additional flavoring. </p>
<p>The brilliance lies in the addition of ginseng and mulberry leaves, making the formula even more nourishing, revitalizing all aspects of vital energy and blood, thus alleviating the suffering of dryness. </p>
<p>Dryness conditions often accompany fear, make it difficult to bend or stretch the waist, and are linked to hernias in men and abdominal pain in women, as well as protruding eyes. These are conditions that are not easily treated. However, I believe they can be treated, as all these symptoms are related to kidney issues.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Kidney deficiency can be replenished. When the kidneys are replenished, there is blood in the heart, which can stop shock; when the kidneys are replenished, there is essence in the waist, allowing for movement; when the kidneys are replenished, there is fluid in the Ren and Du channels, enabling men to eliminate hernias and women to alleviate pain. What worries are there about minor ailments like blindness or protruding eyes? </p>
<p>I now particularly pass on a formula called Capital Moistening Decoction: two taels of cooked rehmannia, thirty pieces of mulberry leaves, five qian of cornelian cherry, one tael each of sand ginseng and white atractylodes, three qian of sweet chrysanthemum, prepared in water for consumption. This formula solely replenishes the kidneys, with a slight addition to strengthen the spleen. Why is this? Dryness must lead to thirst, and thirst must lead to a lot of drinking; excessive water creates dampness in the waist and cannot be dispelled. White atractylodes is most beneficial for the lower abdomen, and combined with cooked rehmannia, which replenishes the kidneys, makes sure it is not too dry, thus assisting each other successfully. This is the brilliance of the formula. If faced with such ailments, using this formula has never resulted in failure.</p>
<p>Once the dryness disease is eliminated, the subsequent plan is to greatly replenish kidney water. When the water is sufficient, the lung&#39;s metal will be nourished, and then the Six Flavor Decoction, plus Mai Dong (Ophiopogon) and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandra), can be used for treatment.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In treating conditions, one should not use cooling medicines, nor warming tonics, but rather employ neutral, balancing remedies, hence the term &quot;balancing treatment.&quot; These ailments stem from dryness of the lung qi. When the lung&#39;s metal qi becomes too dry, it poses unforeseen risks; if not treated urgently, it can lead to conditions like lung atrophy or lung abscess. Extreme dryness can generate heat, which ideally requires cooling medicines. Why not cooling medicines, you ask? The lungs are located in the upper part of the body; using cooling medicines might chill the lungs, or the medicine may not swiftly reach the lungs but instead affect the spleen and stomach. If the lung&#39;s heat is not cleared, the stomach might develop symptoms of vacuity and cold, leading to diarrhea. Prolonged diarrhea will deplete the stomach&#39;s vitality. If the stomach lacks vitality, how can it produce lung metal and nourish lung qi? Therefore, it is better to use neutral, balancing flavors to gently nourish the stomach and simultaneously clear the lung&#39;s metal qi. The prescription includes three qian of Yuanshen (literal translation: &quot;original ginseng&quot;), five qian of Mai Dong (ocean flower), one qian each of Jie Geng (platycodon root), Tian Men Dong (asparagus root), Gan Cao (licorice), Zi Wan (aster), Dong Hua (winter flower), Bei Mu (fritillaria), and Su Zi (perilla seed), boiled in water to take. This formula constitutes a purely neutral, balancing type of tonic and specifically targets the lung&#39;s metal qi. With long-term use, the stomach will not be cold, and the lung metal will be nourished; thus, conditions like lung atrophy and lung abscess will not arise. Therefore, if one has a prolonged cough, they should earnestly take this formula and must not be swayed by seasonal practitioners to use excessively cold medicines.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety&quot; states: A man named Dai visited his relative in the south of Cao, who was suffering from severe constipation. He had no other symptoms but was often afraid to eat fully, as this would make his bowel movements extremely difficult, with stools as hard as iron or stone, sometimes only occurring once every three to five days, accompanied by bleeding from the nose and pain in the rectum and large intestine. The pain was so intense that it caused dizziness. Taking medicine would worsen his condition; he had tried various drastic remedies, including croton seeds, cassia flowers, and others. If taken in excess, he felt lethargic, and stopping would return him to dryness. After several years of this, he grew fearful of the violent nature of the medicine and refused to take any, choosing instead to lie in bed awaiting the end.</p>
<p>When Dai visited, he examined the pulses in both hands, which were slippery yet strong. He administered a large dose of the Da Chengqi Decoction and followed up with Shen Gong Wan and Ma Ren Wan, instructing him to eat dishes made with water chestnuts, amaranth, and pig or sheep’s blood in soup. After more than a hundred days of this regimen, he regained strength, astonishing his family.</p>
<p>Alas! Coarse practitioners do not know that dryness can be of four kinds: external dryness causing the skin to crack and peel, internal dryness leading to a depletion of essence and blood, upper dryness resulting in a dry throat and nose, and lower dryness causing constipation in bowel movements. The condition of dryness arises from the yangming transforming, which is due to cold water and a deficiency of fluids. However, one can use purging methods, selecting remedies accordingly. For instance, croton seeds can purge cold, cassia and gardenia can purge dampness, and rhubarb and natron can purge dryness. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;Use acrid substances to moisten, and salty substances to soften.&quot; The &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; states: &quot;Use slippery substances to nourish the openings.&quot;<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the Eastern region, a woman suffered from severe constipation and dribbling urination, having been unable to conceive for half her life. Whenever she took laxatives, her constipation would relieve; however, it would recur if she stopped. Suddenly, she became pregnant, and around the fourth or fifth month, the doctor prohibited laxatives, making her bowel issues return. She strained greatly when trying to defecate, resulting in a miscarriage. This happened three times. Later, she became pregnant again at three or four months, experiencing urinary issues, and subsequently miscarried again. She then sought the advice of a healer.</p>
<p>The healer examined her pulse, finding it slippery and strong in both wrists. Although the pulse was strong, due to her pregnancy, he dared not use aggressive methods. Instead, he employed dietary therapy, making a broth with flower alkali and boiled wild taro greens, adding plantain seeds mixed with pig and sheep&#39;s blood. After half a year, she successfully gave birth, and her condition improved.</p>
<p>The healer remarked that he had often seen pregnant women suffer from bleeding due to excessively forcing, leading to miscarriages, yet treatment in this way had healed many without counting. Those who strictly adhere to traditional medical practices and do not adapt are not true physicians, nor true scholars. It is rare to find knowledgeable physicians; this is difficult to discuss.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Traditions&quot; states: My elder brother, Huai De, a recluse, aged forty-five, has always been thin and has had a low blood supply. During the year of Geng Zi, when metal was overly abundant, the autumn became particularly dry, leading to dryness illnesses. His skin cracked, his hands and feet became parched, itching caused flakes to rise, and painful bleeding occurred, yet he could not relieve the itch even with thickened nails. I prepared a prescription, named &quot;Blood Generating and Skin Moistening Drink,&quot; and after taking a few doses, his illness drastically improved. Subsequently, I treated over ten others with similar success.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>
