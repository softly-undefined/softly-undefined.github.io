<p><strong>Pediatric Internal Organs and Symptoms</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct Instructions for Children</strong> (Song Dynasty, Qian Yi)</p>
<p><strong>Five Organs: Deficiency and Excess, Cold and Heat</strong></p>
<p>The heart governs surprise. In cases of excess, the child cries and has a fever, and may twitch when drinking water; in cases of deficiency, the child feels weak and has palpitations. If there is excess heat in the heart, the child may sleep with their face up or grind their teeth; this is treated with Daohong San. If the heart qi is excessive and the child prefers to lie on their back, this is treated with Xiexin Tang.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>[Note: If there are signs of excess heat in the heart and small intestine, treat with previous medicines. If there is deficiency in the heart and spleen blood, use Wumei Yigong San combined with Angelica. If due to insufficient heart blood, use Mi Zhi An Shen Wan. For dryness of liver and heart blood, use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San. If there is deficiency of liver and heart blood, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If due to spleen deficiency causing food stagnation and phlegm leading to fright and unrest, use Si Jun Zi to strengthen the spleen, Shen Qu and Mai Ya to aid digestion, and Shan Zhi and Chai Hu to clear heat. If the above formulas are used and the illness persists, promptly adjust to replenish the vital energy; or if symptoms worsen, urgently warm and replenish the vital energy. This often results from pregnancy with rich flavors and emotional fluctuations, or from improper breastfeeding in infants, or from the nursing mother&#39;s diet and emotional disturbances. Once the illness manifests and vital energy is deficient, one must trace the causes and primarily support the stomach to strengthen energy, complemented by medicines to treat the disease. I will follow this approach.]</p>
<p>The liver governs wind; if there is excess, the face will turn green, eyes will be straight, and there will be loud crying and strong heat with neck tightness and restlessness; if there is deficiency, there will be teeth grinding and yawning. </p>
<p>When there is heat in the liver, the hands grasp at clothing and fidget with objects; use Xie Qing Wan for this. For intense heat, drinking water causes wheezing; use Xie Bai San for this.</p>
<p>[Note: If there are symptoms of liver wood excess heat causing wind and self-illness, and if lung metal is in excess heat affecting wood, use the previous two medicines to dispel the excess evil qi.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>If there is wind-heat in the liver channel with symptoms like straightening of the eyes, use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San to clear liver fire, and add Wei Si Wu Tang to nourish liver blood. If there is kidney deficiency with symptoms like teeth grinding, use Liu Jun Zi Tang to strengthen the spleen, and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water. If one does not carefully examine the signs of deficiency or excess and improperly uses the above medications, the dangers of deficiency will be unavoidable. Be cautious!</p>
<p>If there is wind in the liver, the eyes are linked with disturbance; if there is heart heat, it leads to convulsions, or the tendons and veins are pulled leading to direct vision. Use Xie Qing Wan to treat the liver and Dao Chi San to clear the heart.</p>
<p>If there is liver heat, the eyes are red, and if accompanied by convulsions, also use the above two medications. If the wind is severe, the body becomes stiff and tense; use Di Huang Wan to tonify the kidneys and Xie Qing Wan to treat the liver.</p>
<p>Note: For the previous symptoms, if there is excess heat in the liver channel, Xie Qing Wan is appropriate. If the blood in the liver channel is dry and causes diseases, then Yi Gan San should be used. If kidney water is insufficient to nourish the liver, then Di Huang Wan is suitable. If the spleen soil is weak and cannot strengthen the wood, Liu Jun Zi Tang should be employed. </p>
<p>In cases where the liver channel is already affected, the clash of wind and fire leads to damage to the spleen. If the fundamental is not secured, other symptoms will inevitably emerge.</p>
<p>The spleen governs worries; if there is excess, the body heat leads to thirst, use Xie Huang San; if deficient, vomiting and diarrhea lead to wind, use Yi Gong San.</p>
<p>Facial pallor, abdominal pain, cold qi in the mouth, loss of appetite, or vomiting clear water—use Yi Huang San for warming and supplementation. For spleen deficiency with diarrhea, use Tiao Zhong Wan. </p>
<p>Frequent yawning and sleepiness indicate spleen qi deficiency that may provoke fright.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>According to previous evidence, if there is fever with thirst, a preference for cold food and drink, or diarrhea with yellow color, and the person sleeps with their eyes open, this indicates a condition of both heat and fullness in the body, and it is advisable to use the Xie Huang San to drain and guide it. If there is fever with dry mouth, aversion to cold food and drink, or diarrhea with white color, and the person sleeps with their eyes closed, this indicates a condition of both cold and deficiency in the body, and it is appropriate to use the Yi Gong San to adjust and tonify it. If the spleen qi is sinking, the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang should be used for elevation and tonification. If cold water insults the earth element, the Yi Huang San should be applied for warming and supplementation. If the liver wood overcomes the earth element, the Liu Jun Cha Hu Ping Bu should be used for balancing and tonifying. If there are slight eye movements, tidal heat, convulsions, vomiting, and diarrhea with loss of appetite, it is recommended to use the Mi Zhi Bao Pi Tang. For pediatric ailments, one should first regulate and tonify the spleen and stomach to solidify the foundation, leading to the resolution of all diseases.</p>
<p>The lungs govern喘 (asthma), and if there is fullness, it leads to obstruction, turmoil, and rapid breathing with difficulty when drinking water; if there is deficiency, it results in a choking sensation and difficulty exhaling. </p>
<p>If there is lung heat, one can use the Gan Ju Tang for treatment, which involves using the hands to touch the eyebrows, eyes, nose, and facial area. </p>
<p>If lung excess is further affected by wind and cold, it leads to fullness in the chest, qi obstruction, wheezing, and distressing breaths. First, use the Xie Bai San to clear lung qi, followed by the Da Qing Gao to disperse wind and cold.</p>
<p>If the lung organ is weak, resulting in pale lips, the Ejiao San should be employed to tonify. Conditions of obstruction, turmoil, coarse breathing, rapid shallow breaths, and choking sensations are difficult to treat, indicating severe lung deficiency.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>【Note: If the pores are not closed tightly and external pathogens affect the lungs, use Clear Lung Pills. If there is a deficiency of spleen and stomach qi, which cannot nourish the lungs, use Six Gentlemen Decoction. If there is excess spleen and stomach qi leading to constipation and lung disease, use Yellow Drainage Powder. If heart fire is scorching the lung metal, use Rehmannia Pills.】 The kidneys govern deficiency; if the fetal essence is weak and the spirit insufficient, with lackluster eyes and pale complexion, these are signs of difficulty in nurturing; even if one conceives, life will not be long. If desires further complicate the situation, many varied symptoms will arise, making recovery more challenging. If one is sensitive to light and feels a sinking sensation, it is due to heavy bones and a contracted body; if one grinds their teeth, it is because kidney fluid is insufficient to control heart fire; both should use Rehmannia Pills. 【Note: According to Mr. Jie Gu, the sinking sensation indicates insufficient kidney qi, resulting in heat in the lower limbs, hence the dislike of clothing covering them. Below the navel is governed by the kidneys, as heart qi descends to the kidney area, thus it is appropriate to use Rehmannia Pills to bolster water, control fire, and nourish the kidneys. Therefore, one must ensure that essence and blood are fully established before marriage, in order to avoid previous issues. The Essence and Blood section states: If a man&#39;s essence is not fully developed and he engages with a woman, to share his essence, then there will be deficiencies in various parts of the body, and there may be troublesome conditions. Now, if a child’s endowment is insufficient, isn’t this derived from the same cause?】<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>The Treatment of Organ Interactions</strong></p>
<p>When liver disease appears in autumn, the liver is strong and overtakes the lungs, causing lung weakness. It is advisable to use Ejiao San to nourish the lungs, Yiyuang San to strengthen the spleen, and Xieqing Wan to treat the liver. </p>
<p>[Note: According to Mr. Jie Gu Zhang, when the liver overpowers the lungs, the body feels hot, leading to spasms, shortness of breath, and symptoms appearing during the periods of Shen, You, and Xu. This is described as true strength, unable to conquer due to external constraints. If the heart takes control of the liver as a real pathogenic factor, there is strong heat and significant spasms. For this situation, Li Jing and Liang Jing Wan can be administered. When the lungs take control of the liver as a thief&#39;s evil, the patient experiences yawning and weak spasms. For this, Di Huang Wan is used to nourish the liver, while Xie Bai San is employed to treat the lungs. </p>
<p>When the liver overcomes the spleen as a thief&#39;s evil, the patient feels sleepy, heavy in body, and experiences spasms, with Xieqing Wan being the treatment of choice. If the kidneys overcome the liver as a vacuous evil, the patient experiences a dislike of cold, yawning, and spasms; in this case, Qiang Huo Gao is indicated. Generally, in cases of liver disease, one must first examine the condition of the lungs and kidneys. The kidneys are the mother of the liver, and metal is the thief of wood; without kidney water, they cannot nourish each other, leading to the lung metal&#39;s spirit evil attacking. Therefore, when the source is in the lungs, one must first treat the lungs to dispel the spirit evil; if the source is in the kidneys, one should first nourish the kidneys to support their foundation. Then, one should assess the vacuity or repletion of the root organ and determine whether warming or cooling treatments are necessary. This approach aligns with the views of Liang Baoren as well.**<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Heart disease in winter manifests when the heart is stronger than the kidneys. In severe cases, there may be a descent causing lack of speech. One should use the Di Huang Wan to tonify the kidneys and Dao Chi San to treat the heart.</p>
<p>Note: According to Jie Gu, if there is wheezing with strong heat, this indicates the lungs invading the heart, which is a slight evil, treated with Xie Bai San. If there is a clash of wind and heat, this indicates the liver invading the heart, representing a deficiency evil, treated with Da Qiang Huo Tang and Da Qing Wan. If there is vomiting and diarrhea with body heat, this indicates the spleen invading the heart, representing a solid evil, treated with Xie Huang San. If there is fear accompanied by chills, this indicates the kidneys invading the heart, representing a thief evil, treated with An Shen Wan. </p>
<p>Generally, when there is heart disease, one must first regulate the liver. The kidneys are the spirit of the heart. When the liver’s qi is smooth, the heart’s qi is harmonious; when the liver’s qi is weak, the heart’s qi is deficient. Thus, for heart ailments, first address the liver to clear the source. When the five organs are ill, it must be transmitted to those they conquer; therefore, when the kidneys are afflicted, it will inevitably affect the heart. Hence, first treat the kidneys to expel the evil. If the liver and kidneys are balanced and there is still heart illness, then one should examine the deficiency and fullness for treatment.</p>
<p>Lung disease manifests in spring when the lungs are stronger than the liver, treated with Xie Bai San for the lungs. If the eyes are pale blue or red, there may be convulsions, indicating liver deficiency, treated with Di Huang Wan to tonify the liver.</p>
<p>Note: According to Jie Gu, if lung disease presents with wheezing and strong qi, appearing at the times of Yin, Mao, and Chen, one should tonify the liver and drain the lungs. If lung disease persists with cough, it is advisable to tonify the spleen and clear the heart. If the heart invades the lungs, representing a thief evil, with heat and wheezing, use Di Huang Wan, Dao Chi San, and E Jiao San.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>If the liver affects the lungs as a subtle pathogen, leading to symptoms like dizziness and confusion caused by evil wind, use Qianghuo Powder. If the kidneys affect the lungs as a solid pathogen, causing chills and a clear cough, use Baibu Pill. If the spleen affects the lungs as a vacuous pathogen, resulting in heaviness, phlegm, and diarrhea with cough, use Ginseng and Atractylodes Powder. Generally, when the lungs are ill, one must first examine the heart and spleen to treat them. If heart fire is excessive and burns the lungs, leading to lung disease, it is necessary to first suppress heart energy. If lung energy is insufficient and the pores are not tight, resulting in sensitivity to wind pathogens, it is essential to first bolster spleen energy. If there is fullness and stagnation in the middle jiao and heat vapor rises, one should first regulate spleen energy. If heart and spleen are balanced, then treat the primary channels.</p>
<p>When kidney illness presents in summer, when water overwhelms fire, the kidneys affect the heart, which may lead to severe palpitations and spasms, and the remedy is to disperse the wind.</p>
<p>(Note: According to Jiegugu, if the heart influences the kidneys, it is a subtle pathogen, causing fever without aversion to wind or cold; use Cinnamon Twig Pill. If the lungs influence the kidneys as a vacuous pathogen, causing wheezing and cold dampness on the skin, use Baibu Pill. If the liver affects the kidneys as a solid pathogen, causing rigidity and spasms with cold body symptoms, use Lihong Pill. If the spleen influences the kidneys as a thief pathogen, resulting in heaviness, diarrhea, and aversion to cold, use Lihong Pill. Generally, among the five elements, the kidneys are the only organ where the mother is strong and the offspring suffers from pathogens. However, the nature of things can’t be generalized, notably with the lungs and kidneys.)<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>What does this mean? The lungs govern qi; if there is heat in the lungs, it generates heat and upward steam, preventing it from nourishing the kidneys, thus causing evil to affect the kidneys. Hence, the source of kidney disease lies in the lungs. Furthermore, dampness from the spleen channel can harm the kidneys; therefore, it is necessary to clear lung heat and remove spleen dampness. If the disease arises from this channel itself, it should be nourished and supplemented.</p>
<p>Spleen diseases manifest nearby; they should be treated similarly. Those that present normally are easy to treat, while those that present abnormally are difficult to treat. If the spleen is deficient, the complexion will appear yellow. The five organs interact; treatment should follow the symptoms.</p>
<p>Note: According to ancient texts, when diseases of the spleen arise, one must first examine the deficiency or excess of the liver and heart and treat accordingly. The liver is the spleen&#39;s thief, while the heart is the spleen&#39;s mother. If liver qi is strong, it hinders the spleen; if heart qi is deficient, the spleen becomes weak. Thus, when the liver overacts on the spleen, it leads to wind-dampness causing vomiting; in such cases, the method of administering Fu Ling and Ban Xia decoction is appropriate. If heart qi is robust and there is strong heat, leading to heaviness and diarrhea, one should resort to Qiang Huo, Huáng Qín, Cāng Zhú, and Gān Cǎo decoction. If the lungs overact on the spleen causing coughing and constipation while diet is normal, then Chefing and Dà Huáng decoction should be administered, along with the use of Téng Li Wán. If the kidneys overact on the spleen resulting in aversion to cold and diarrhea, methods like the Rì Zhōng Wán should be used.</p>
<p>I humbly believe that the symptoms of the five organs interact in ways that are concealed and unpredictable, yet the mechanism of disease does not stray from the principles of the five elements of generation, overcoming, and transformation. Furthermore, since children do not have the seven emotions fully developed, their ailments often arise from weak and frail constitutions and incomplete blood and qi, leading to diseases where the five organs overpower each other. Therefore, one should prioritize treating the mother (root cause) rather than focusing solely on the child (symptoms), as this often leads to mistakes.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Secret of Infant Care</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on the Diagnosis and Treatment of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>All diseases arise from the five organs; if one does not understand the organs and bowels, it is futile. By carefully combining color and pulse for diagnosis, it is not difficult to adapt prescriptions and treat ailments. When the five organs are in harmony, no disease arises. Whether it be due to imbalances from cold and heat or disruptions in diet, maladies arise: wind injures the liver, heat affects the heart, cold harms the lungs, dampness injures the kidneys, and dietary issues damage the spleen. Correspondingly, the colors are as follows: the liver is green, the heart red, the spleen yellow, the lungs white, and the kidneys black. For the pulses: the liver is string-like, the heart is surging, the spleen is slow, the lung is fine, and the kidneys are deep. In terms of symptoms, the liver governs wind, the heart is associated with fright, the spleen deals with fatigue, the lungs are linked to wheezing, and the kidneys signify deficiency. Regarding treatment: the heart, lungs, and spleen may have both tonifying and reducing methods, while the liver solely has reducing techniques, and the kidneys have only tonification without reduction. The assessment of color, pulse, symptoms, and treatment is fundamentally based on the five organs; understanding this deeply is termed superior skill. Among the five organs, the liver is often excessive, the spleen commonly insufficient, and the kidneys frequently deficient. The heart&#39;s heat equates it with fire, akin to the liver, while the delicate lungs, once injured, do not easily recover. People often say the liver is easily excessive and the spleen often deficient; I also say the heart is often excessive and the lungs often deficient. Excess indicates fullness, while deficiency indicates emptiness.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; says: When pathogenic Qi is strong, there is fullness; when the true Qi is depleted, there is emptiness. This refers to what is in excess and what is insufficient, not merely the distinction between fullness and emptiness as stated in the classics. The liver, when in excess, belongs to wood, thriving in spring, which is the season of the lesser yang energy, the source for all things to flourish. The newborn is called a sprout because it is like the buds of grass and trees, which are initially nourished by the vital energy and are at their most vigorous stage; hence, it is said that the liver is in excess. Excess indicates a natural surplus of yang.</p>
<p>The spleen is often deficient because it governs the energy of earth. In infancy, the only nourishment is breast milk; since solid food has not yet been ingested, the spleen has not yet been engaged in its function, and thus its energy remains weak. Therefore, it is said to be insufficient. Insufficiency indicates a natural deficiency of dietary energy.</p>
<p>The heart is also described as having an excess; it belongs to fire and thrives in summer, which is the manifestation of vigorous fire energy. The kidney, however, signifies deficiency, as it refers to the lack of vital essence inherited from the parents after birth. The lungs too are often deficient; they are delicate organs, difficult to regulate and easily injured. Both the spleen and the lungs belong to the greater yin, and can be harmed by the extremes of cold and heat in nature; should one be affected, the lungs are the first to suffer; similarly, the cold and heat in food can harm the spleen first when in excess. Thus, it is said that both the spleen and the lungs are deficient.</p>
<p>The liver is associated with wind and wood, governing the generation of wind, with manifest symptoms clearly observable in the eyes.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Although purging is of no use to tonify, the energy of the lesser yang is akin to spring. </p>
<p>The liver, associated with the foot Jueyin and the wood element, generates wind, and thus it governs wind. According to the Qian family, the liver governs wind; in fact, it manifests through the eyes with straight gazes, loud calls, yawning, irritability, and a tight neck. If deficient, there may be teeth grinding and excessive yawning; if heat is present, symptoms manifest externally, while damp qi arises internally. These are indications of liver disease. The liver’s orifice is the eyes, so when ill, one often observes symptoms through the eyes. If there is wind in the liver, the eyes may twitch; if there is heat, the gaze may be direct; if there is liver disease, conditions such as a white membrane covering the eyes may occur. Furthermore, the liver governs the tendons, and if diseased, the tendons may be tight, leading to a stiff neck and spasms. The liver governs anger; if afflicted, one may display a hasty temperament, loud cries, and severe cases may lead to testicular swelling, commonly referred to as &quot;qi lump.&quot; When the liver is in the lower jiao, heat can cause difficulty in urination and bowel movements. The liver houses the soul; if liver heat is present, one may search for clothing, fidget with objects, or in severe cases, grasp at empty space and touch the bed, indicating a loss of soul.</p>
<p>The Qian family notes a formula called &quot;Xieqing Pill&quot; for liver disease but does not suggest tonification, declaring that liver qi is excessive. However, the liver belongs to the lesser yang; thus, it is essential for nurturing life. A healthy liver should not be purged to diminish vital energy, nor should it be tonified to promote growth.</p>
<p>The liver and gallbladder were originally treated with fire; within wood, there is fire that no one recognizes.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Water cannot overcome the fire of the dragon thunder; only sweet and warm differences can control it. Diseases of the liver and gallbladder treated by fire stem from the existence of fire within wood. The &quot;Records of the Fire Man&quot; states: knowing that there is fire in the void, when wood is pleasing, it becomes bright. This is its verification. The fire of the liver and gallbladder cannot be extinguished by water or subdued by cold; it is also called the fire of the dragon thunder. Only sweet and warm remedies, such as ginseng and licorice, can control it. Therefore, it is said that sweetness can drain fire. The &quot;Internal Classic&quot; states: pungent substances disperse it, such as Chuanxiong and Fangfeng. It also states: pungent and sweet disperse for the yang. Using pungent and sweet medicines together, the so-called fire stagnation can be released. This is the general principle for treating liver diseases.</p>
<p>For liver heat, one may drain it with Qingpian pills or Danggui and Aloe pills. For a firm liver, the same method applies. For liver deficiency, it is replenished with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. The liver is the child of the kidney; when deficient, one should nourish its mother. For liver cold, one uses the Wendan Decoction along with Wu Zhu Yu and ginger.</p>
<p>In children’s diseases, if they cannot focus their gaze, or if their eyes do not move or cannot close, or if they open their eyes but cannot close them, or if they cry without tears, or do not cry but tears flow, all indicate a severe liver condition.</p>
<p>The heart is the dwelling of the spirit, easily startled, with colors and pulses intertwined, suffering from the invasion of heat. In reality, one should avoid suspicion by draining the bowels. If there is deficiency and anxiety, one must calm the spirit.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The heart is the official of the sovereign, from which spirit and clarity emerge. At birth, a child’s awareness is not yet developed; their perception is easily stirred, hence their spirit is timid and prone to fright. Qian&#39;s perspective indicates: the heart governs fright. In actuality, this manifests as crying and fever, or restlessness after drinking water. In deficiency, there is fatigue, palpitations, and unease—this indicates a heart ailment. The heart governs blood vessels; color reflects the essence of blood, while pulse indicates the heart&#39;s condition. If the complexion appears rosy and the pulse is strong and frequent, it signifies an excess of heart qi, making the child easier to nurture. Conversely, if the complexion appears dull and the pulse is weak and fine, it indicates deficiency, leading to illness and making the child difficult to care for. Observing the shape, color, and pulse reveals the heart&#39;s true state. The heart dislikes heat; when it contends with wind, it leads to convulsions, hence the liver produces wind, which, when heated by the heart, results in convulsions. The heart is associated with fire; when fire is intense, body fluids become depleted, causing thirst. The heart houses the spirit; in heat, the spirit becomes chaotic, leading to restlessness in sleep. If a child prefers to sleep with their face covered, it indicates that heart qi is hot and the chest feels warm, making it hard to speak yet desiring coldness, thus they cover their face when sleeping. When heart qi is abundant, it moves freely; covering the face can obstruct qi flow, hence the preference for sleeping on the back. If the body is stretched upwards, this is termed &quot;ascending,&quot; which also indicates heart heat. The tongue is the sprout of the heart.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>When overheated, the tongue becomes ulcerated, leading to conditions such as heavy and wooden tongue, and an elongated tongue that does not retract. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all pains, itching, sores, and ulcers relate to heart heat. Conditions in children such as tumors, red spots, rashes, and skin ailments are all attributed to heart heat.</p>
<p>The Qian family treats heart heat diseases with Daohong San, which is a laxative for the small intestine. The heart is the sovereign and should not be disturbed; laxatives are used to avoid suspicion. If the heart is deficient, the ruler is uneasy, hence Anshen Wan is used to nourish it.</p>
<p>The heart is the organ of fire; it often suffers from dispersion without consolidation. Master Sun&#39;s Shengmai San is to be taken in summer; its sourness from Schisandra can consolidate the dissipated energy. For treating children&#39;s heart conditions, one can expand and fill the heart. Therefore, for internal heart heat diseases, remedies like Daohong San, Xuanshen Decoction, and Dongyuan Anshen Wan are appropriate; for external manifestations like sores in the mouth or tongue, Xixin San is indicated. For those with deficient heart Qi, Qian&#39;s Anshen Wan is recommended; for those who easily startle, Hupo Baolong Wan is suitable. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: to purge with bitterness, take Huanglian; to supplement with saltiness, take Zexie and Cheqianzi.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Excessive spirit leads to more fright; it is advisable to use vermilion, red resin, and dragon bones to calm it. If the heart condition persists, sweating may emerge; the tongue may protrude and not retract, or a sudden loss of voice may occur, or confusion of the mind, or purplish rashes turning black. These all indicate a severed heart condition, which cannot be treated.</p>
<p>In pediatric prescriptions, many spleen diseases arise simply from excessive dairy and food intake, leading to persistent ailments. Whether from hunger or fullness, both can create illness, as cold and heat invade, disrupting the qi.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the spleen and stomach are the officials of storage, where food and grains are gathered. At birth, the spleen is thin and weak, and can easily be harmed by food, hence it is said that the spleen is often insufficient. Qian says: the spleen governs heaviness; when it is full, there is tiredness and warmth followed by thirst; when it is deficient, it produces vomiting and diarrhea leading to wind. This indicates spleen disease.</p>
<p>The spleen belongs to earth, which is stable, hence spleen diseases favor heaviness. Earth governs dampness. When dampness damages, it leads to swelling, bloating, jaundice, and persistent vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in chronic convulsions. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: under the energy of earth, wood energy supports it. Earth represents the earth itself, and this relates to the abdomen; therefore, spleen diseases may manifest as abdominal pain, and spleen-related conditions result in a distended abdomen and blue veins.</p>
<p>The orifice of the spleen is the lips; if there is wind in the spleen, the mouth may twitch and the lips move; if there is heat, there may be bad breath and sores on the lips; if there is cold, drooling at the corners of the mouth occurs, known as stagnation of the lips. When the qi is not harmonized, the mouth may frequently pucker.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The spleen governs the tongue; when there is heat, it causes the tongue to be thrust out and moved about. The spleen governs flesh; when the spleen is deficient, one becomes thin, and the flesh breaks down. The spleen governs taste; when the spleen is deficient, one lacks appetite, while excess heat in the spleen means that food does not produce muscle tissue. Injury from food may lead to accumulation, and prolonged accumulation can result in habitual disorders. The spleen governs body fluids; heat in the spleen causes dry mouth and a need for water. In deficiency, body fluids do not generate, leading to sores.</p>
<p>Regarding the differences and similarities between the spleen and stomach, it is said that the stomach receives grains, while the spleen transforms them. To regulate the spleen and stomach, one must adapt to their respective cold and warmth and manage their diet. Therefore, overeating damages the stomach, while hunger harms the spleen; heat injures the stomach, while cold affects the spleen.</p>
<p>The stomach prefers coolness, while the spleen enjoys warmth; thus, one cannot treat them the same. Yin and yang must harmonize for balance, and one must not rely solely on either extreme of heat or cold.</p>
<p>The spleen prefers warmth and dislikes cold, while the stomach enjoys coolness and shuns heat; their preferences differ, making it difficult to adhere to a single method. The spleen and stomach belong to the earth element, located centrally to respond to their surroundings. Hence, the principles must include the four seasonal qi and the harmony of the five tastes. The four qi are cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. The five tastes are sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salty. Pungent and sweet represent yang, while sour, bitter, and salty represent yin. When qi and taste combine, it is termed yin-yang harmonization, achieving balance. An excess of heat damages the stomach, while an excess of cold harms the spleen; this is not the middle path.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>The Qian family&#39;s method of treating conditions is to use Yi Huang San to nourish the spleen. The Elder Dongyuan stated that this method is too heating, and he replaced it with Yi Gong San, demonstrating deep consideration. The ancestral teaching emphasizes that the various methods of the Qian family should be followed. However, regarding the stomach and spleen, for spleen heat, use Xie Huang San; for stomach heat, use Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang; for cold in the spleen and stomach, use Li Zhong Tang Wan; for deficiency of the spleen and stomach, employ Yi Gong San, Tiao Yuan Tang, Ren Shen Bai Shu San, and Yang Pi Wan; for food stagnation, use Xiao Ji Wan and Bao He Wan; for lingering food accumulation, use Zhi Po Da Huang Wan; for dampness prevailing, use Wei Ling Wan; for evolving sores, use Fei Er Wan; and for already formed sores, use Ji Sheng Wan. This is a secret method of our family and should not be disclosed lightly.</p>
<p>If the disease of the spleen persists for a long time, there may be noticeable weight loss, swollen abdomen, visible blue veins, inability to open the mouth, or the mouth and lips may be excessively opened, or there could be generalized swelling, swelling of the tops of the feet, swelling under the eyes, or incessant vomiting and diarrhea with an inability to take in food. Sleep may be disturbed with the eyes remaining open and the mouth not closing, or there may be excessive eating with weight loss, a craving for sweets, or worms emerging from the mouth, or the lips may be pulled tight - all these signs indicate a severe state of the spleen and are untreatable.</p>
<p>The lung is a delicate organ and the primary source of qi; both cold and heat can invade and cause its qi to rebel.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>Heat clogs the chest, causing high panting and unrest; weakness and shortness of breath make it hard to return to tranquility. The lungs are the most elevated, serving as the crown of the organs. The mouth and nose are interconnected, and the inhalation and exhalation of breath, as well as the rise and fall of energy, must pass through them, thus they govern breath. According to the Qian family, the lungs control panting, which indeed manifests as disordered and rapid breathing; some may drink water, while others may not; if deficient, there’s prolonged difficulty in exhaling. This is a symptom of lung disease. The Nanjing states: cold harms the lungs. If a child wears clothing that is too thin, it may lead to cold injury. The Neijing states: heat harms the lungs. If a child is overdressed, it may lead to heat injury. Cold and heat injury the lungs causes reversed qi, resulting in panting and coughing. The nose is the orifice of the lungs; if the lungs are affected by wind, sneezing and a runny nose occur; if affected by cold, it results in nasal congestion and difficult breathing; if affected by heat, it causes dryness of the nose, or even nosebleeds; lung sores lead to red and ulcerated nostrils. The lungs govern the skin and hair; if the lungs are deficient, the skin becomes dry and the hair scorched. In cases of persistent panting and coughing, if panting does not stop, the face becomes swollen; if coughing does not stop, the sternum becomes protruded, referred to as &quot;turtle chest.&quot; Sudden shock leads to a sign of death. The lungs belong to metal, and their essence is dry; in illness, there is unquenchable thirst and a preference for drinking water, known as &quot;diaphragmatic consumption.&quot; The true diaphragm and lung qi communicate with heaven; medicinal use of clear soup is analogous to this. When the lungs are full, ephedra vigorously drains white, while donkey-hide gelatin provides extraordinary benefit for deficiency.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The weather connects to the lungs, light and clear represent the sky, and clear yang emerges from the upper orifices; what comes from the heavens is closest to the top. Therefore, for treating lung diseases, one should use pungent and sweet medicines that promote elevation and dispersion. If it&#39;s bitter and sour, it must be stir-fried with alcohol to encourage ascent. According to Qian&#39;s established prescriptions, for excess lung conditions, one should use Xie Bai San or Ting Li Wan; for deficiency, use Ejiao San. The ancestral teachings say the method is too simple. The lungs govern panting and coughing; if due to cold, use Ma Huang Tang; if due to heat, use Xie Bai San. If lung heat is in the chest, use Dong Yuan Liang Ge San; for thirst, use Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang; for sore throat, use Gan Ju Niu Bang Zi Tang; if there&#39;s a cough with phlegm, use Yu Ye Wan; if lung deficiency is severe, use Tiao Yuan Tang. The lung is the child of the spleen; if deficient, one should replenish its mother. Sometimes, simply use Sheng Mai San. Thus, the method is initially complete.</p>
<p>If the lung has been ill for a long time, with persistent coughing, unceasing panting, or shoulder breathing, or if the chest is sunken, coughing up blood that does not stop, or coughing that causes fright, or if the nose is dry and blackened, or the nostrils are flaring and panting, or if there is persistent diarrhea, loud roaring like a barrel, or if the face appears emaciated with reverse panting—these are all signs of lung exhaustion; without treatment, they would worsen.</p>
<p>Heaven is the true essence concentrated at the Gate of Life; without the celestial pulse, a person is rootless like a tree without roots.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The essence of the kidneys should be strong, for water cannot withstand the burning of two fires. The kidneys belong to water, and they arise from the true essence of heaven. A person has kidneys just as a tree has roots. The pulse is checked at the wrist; the state of the kidneys can be observed through the wrist pulse. The life gate is situated between the kidneys, where the original qi gathers with sincerity. The strength or weakness, longevity or premature death of a child is especially connected to this. A complete mastery requires no deficiency.</p>
<p>If the kidney qi is insufficient, it will sink down, as the heavy bones desire to drop and retract the body. Kidney water is of the yin; if the kidneys are deficient, the eyes fear light. The child is fundamentally weak and timid, stemming from a failure of the prenatal qi which leads to insufficient spirit. The whites of the eyes are abundant, and the skull becomes relaxed; the complexion appears pale and white, all of which are difficult to nourish. Sometimes, this could be due to illness rather than kidney deficiency; this belongs to the signs of illness.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bones; if the kidneys are deficient, the marrow is not full. Children are particularly afraid of the cold, often suffering from maladies involving weakness. If the coccyx is undeveloped, they cannot sit; if the kneecaps are undeveloped, they cannot walk. Teeth are the surplus of bones; if bones are insufficient, teeth emerge slowly. The fluid of the kidneys is blood, and hair is the surplus of blood; if the kidneys are deficient, the hair is sparse and not black. The openings of the kidneys are in the ears; if the kidneys are deficient, the ears become thin, and heat may lead to the discharge of pus from within. </p>
<p>The kidneys open to the two yin, and if the kidneys are hot, there will be obstruction in urination; if cold, urination will resemble rice water.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>The second fire refers to the fire of the ruler and minister. The classic states: &quot;One water cannot withstand two fires.&quot; This is exactly the meaning. The yin is always insufficient, and the kidneys are often deficient; therefore, the tendons and bones cannot fully develop, leading to emaciation. The Qian clan&#39;s treatment mainly focuses on replenishment. The classic mentions that sores and rashes require purgation and the rest. Water represents yin, and fire represents yang; when one water cannot withstand two fires, it indicates excess yang and insufficient yin, clearly showing the deficiency at the root of the kidneys. Therefore, the Qian clan only uses the Replenishing Kidney Dihuang pill. They dare not purge, due to a lack of concrete evidence. Some claim that for rashes, the kidneys should not be nourished but instead purged. This statement is quite erroneous. The kidneys govern fluids; the blood transformed in rashes becomes water, and this water transforms into pus, all of which are derived from the kidney&#39;s fluids. If the kidney water is absent, the sores would dry up, turn black, and lead to death. How could one possibly purge? The sickness of rashes labeled as returning to the kidneys indicates that the poison of the sores and rashes arises from the marrow and manifests externally on the skin; when it turns black and sinks back into the marrow, it becomes harmful. This is not harm caused by the surface but a disease of excess fire and diminished water. The Qian clan treats blackened and sunken issues with Baixiang pills and Niuli paste to purge the evil within the kidneys, not the true yin of the kidneys. This is elaborated in &quot;Essentials of Rashes.&quot; For kidney heat and constipation, it is advisable to guide it with pig bile.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>The pig is an aquatic animal. For those who have difficulty with urination, it is advisable to use Wuling Powder to drain the bladder. Dongyuan’s Ziyin Pill is used to dispel kidney fire. If kidney disease persists, leading to downward sinking of the body, and one perceives ghost-like images in the eyes, or experiences weakness in the bones, unable to rise from bed, or suffers from loss of bowel and bladder control, these are signs of kidney depletion and are difficult to treat. </p>
<p>The discussion of the internal organs is based on the mental/spiritual aspect, distinguishing clear methods of supplementation and draining. If they are seen to share coexisting diseases, it is more appropriate to consider their interrelation and modify the approach accordingly. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Nanjing&quot;, there are discussions about five evils: The genuine condition involves the internal organs themselves, while the external pathologies that come from the front are considered real; those that come from behind are seen as empty; evils that arise from being overpowered are termed subtle evils, and those that do not hold power over are referred to as thieves. This aligns with the theory of the five elements of generation and overcoming. </p>
<p>Qian’s assessment states that the liver governs wind, the heart governs fright, the spleen governs obstruction, the lungs govern wheezing, and the kidneys govern emptiness. All of these pertain to primary internal diseases, termed genuine and evil, thus establishing methods of five supplements and six drains. Mr. Jiegu took the words of the Nanjing to elucidate the evidence of transformation in the five organs, supplementing aspects that Qian’s theory did not cover, ensuring a complete method. Hence, wind harms the liver, heat harms the heart, dampness harms the lungs, cold harms the kidneys, and exhaustion from food intake injures the spleen. These pertain to evils that afflict the five organs themselves, marking them as the primary illness.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The liver is responsible for wind, and the wind in this context refers to the primary illness, known as true and false pathogens. If the condition is due to injury from heat, the true pathogen is the heart invading the liver; if it arises from injury by dampness, the false pathogen is the kidney invading the liver; if it results from dietary strain and fatigue, the minor pathogen is the spleen overcoming the liver. The other organs resemble this pattern. For detailed understanding, refer to the &quot;Forty-Nine Difficulties.&quot;</p>
<p>In the discussion of treatment methods for the five organs, if the liver is directly affected, the treatment should focus solely on the liver, using Qing Wan for drainage. If the heart is invading the liver, the appropriate remedy is to use Dao Chi to drain the heart, which effectively addresses the root issue. If the kidney injures the liver, one should use Jiang Fu Si Ni Tang to strengthen the kidney deficiency, thereby nourishing its mother. If the lung transmits to the liver, the recommended approach is to use Xie Bai San to drain the lung and Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver, first nourishing and then draining. If the spleen burdens the liver, it is advisable to use Tiao Yuan Tang to benefit the spleen and regulate the liver. The same reasoning applies to the other organs.</p>
<p>For other methods, there is no need for rigid adherence; they can be understood and applied flexibly. These all address the initial onset of the illness. </p>
<p>Moreover, when one organ&#39;s illness affects another, it is termed a &quot;concurrent syndrome,&quot; and the treatment should consider the urgency of the primary and secondary conditions. The initially observed condition is termed the &quot;root&quot; and is treated as less urgent, while the subsequent condition is called the &quot;branch&quot; and is treated as more urgent.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>If there is difficulty in urination or defecation, persistent vomiting or diarrhea, swollen throat and pain, inability to eat, or urgent pain in the heart and abdomen, even if these symptoms appear later, they should be treated first. Therefore, it is said that in emergencies, one treats the symptoms. If there are no urgent symptoms, one should treat the initial illness first, and then address subsequent ailments based on their manifestations, which is known as treating the root when the situation allows.</p>
<p>In general, a child’s spleen issues are often due to improper balancing of milk and food. Knowing that other organ problems require harmonizing the stomach is vital; otherwise, it can lead to malnutrition and suffering. The stomach governs the intake of grains, while the spleen is responsible for their digestion. Hunger can harm the stomach, and overfeeding can insult the spleen. Children often suffer from overeating. If a mother is robust and has abundant milk, seeking to prevent the child from crying can lead to excessive breastfeeding, which can damage the milk&#39;s properties. Conversely, if the mother is weak and thin, her milk will be scarce, and to soothe the child’s cries, she may resort to giving them grains, meats, pastries, and fruits, leading to overindulgence and harm from food.</p>
<p>Thus, children&#39;s ailments are mostly related to the stomach. The five organs rely on the stomach&#39;s qi for nourishment. The stomach represents a balance of vital energy, unlike the individual weaknesses of the five organs. If any of the organs are affected, whether through purging or tonifying, one must be cautious not to disturb the stomach&#39;s qi. If the stomach&#39;s qi is damaged, it may lead to inability to eat and weight loss, or good appetite with weight loss, resulting in malnutrition which cannot be treated. As the classic says: “Whole grains lead to prosperity; absence of grains leads to demise.&quot; This is indeed a critical insight in the medical field.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p>
<h3>Five Zang Organs and Their Related Diseases</h3>
<p>These are diseases arising from the movement of qi within the five zang organs, indicating illnesses that originate internally. The liver governs wind; when abundant, it leads to straight vision, yawning, loud crying, and a feeling of tension and discomfort in the neck. When deficient, it causes teeth clenching and yawning. If qi is warm, it internally generates wind; if qi is hot, it generates external wind as well. Qi here refers to the breath in the mouth. In cases of excess, use Xieqing pills or Danggui Longhui pills to purge; in cases of deficiency, use Dihuang pills to tonify. </p>
<p>All wind-related symptoms, convulsions, and distortions are indicative of liver disease and should be treated with Xieqing pills. Diseases originating from the liver, such as dizziness due to wind, belong to the wood element of the liver. The &quot;Pulse Canon&quot; states: heat generates wind. If there is a concurrent heart condition, it can result in fever and convulsions. If there is wind in the liver, it can cause the eyes to twitch lightly; if there is also heat in the heart, it can lead to blockage. If there is heat in the liver, the eyes may see straight without twitching; if heat in the heart is present, twitching occurs. Use Xieqing pills to purge the liver and Daochi powder to purge the heart.</p>
<p>If there are also symptoms from the spleen, mild cases may result in drowsiness and lack of appetite; one should observe the state of the stool. If the stool is dry, use honey-based remedies to gently guide it out, being careful not to propose purgation, for fear it may lead to spleen deficiency and worsen the condition. If the stool is moist, use Hupo Baolong pills as the treatment.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>When there are also lung symptoms, with rapid breathing and a feeling of tightness, phlegm and mucous blockages must be resolved through urination and defecation. If the breathing sounds are audible, shoulders are raised, and the chest is high, with phlegm noises in the throat, it should not be treated. The Qingning Powder is prescribed.</p>
<p>When there are also kidney symptoms, with sudden hoarseness and loss of voice, along with stiff limbs, this should be treated for wind. In mild cases, the Dihuang Pill is used; in severe cases, it becomes a chronic condition that cannot be treated.</p>
<p>The heart governs shock; if it is real, there will be crying and fever, and a tendency to convulse after drinking water; if it is empty, there will be fatigue, insomnia, and restless palpitations. For real conditions, the Daohong Pian herbal decoction is prescribed; for empty conditions, the Er An Shen Pill is used.</p>
<p>Various manifestations of heat, shock, and agitation with frequent crying indicate a primary heart condition. The Daohong Powder with朱砂 (cinnabar) is suitable for treatment. In severe cases, the Liangjing San Huang Xie Xin Wan should be used.</p>
<p>Diseases arising from the heart, as the texts say: all pains, itching, sores, and ailments belong to heart fire.</p>
<p>When there are also liver symptoms, there may be fever and convulsions, in which case the Mutong Powder should be administered.</p>
<p>When there are also spleen symptoms, with excessive sleep, dreaming of grinding teeth, and frequent shock, the Qian Family An Shen Pill should be prescribed.</p>
<p>When there are also lung symptoms, with fever, convulsions, and wheezing, the Qingning Powder should be administered.</p>
<p>When there are also kidney symptoms, there may be sudden fainting, teeth grinding, convulsions, and cold hands and feet upon onset; after the episode, one wakes up in a daze. This is because the heart houses the spirit; shock harms the spirit; the kidneys store will; fear harms will.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>When a child is mentally timid and fearful, their spirit becomes unsettled and can lead to convulsions. As mentioned in the scriptures, when a monk is asked to recite mantras while touching the child&#39;s head, if the child becomes frightened, they may develop convulsions and later react when they see someone in dark clothing. Some may experience prolonged fear leading to convulsions; if treated early, they can be cured using the Ding Zhi Wan. If parents are negligent and do not treat it for long, it becomes a lifelong issue.</p>
<p>The heart fire represents the sovereign fire, which ought to cultivate virtue and not be toxic; when it causes itchiness or sores, it is the result of the ming men fire. Any sores on children stem from fetal toxins.</p>
<p>The spleen governs dampness, resulting in true fatigue or sleepiness, and a warm body prompting the need for water; if this leads to vomiting or diarrhea, it generates wind. If dampness is excessive, it can be treated with Xie Huang San or San Huang Wan; if it&#39;s deficient, it&#39;s treated with Yi Huang San, Yi Gong San, Xiao Jian Zhong Tang, or Tiao Yuan Tang, and Fei Er Wan for nourishment.</p>
<p>Sleepiness without appetite, along with vomiting and diarrhea, are all root issues of the spleen. For heavy sleep and fever, Wei Ling Wan or Hu Po Bao Long Wan should be used. For vomiting and diarrhea, if cold, the person will not feel thirsty, and Li Zhong Wan is appropriate; if hot, they will crave cold water, with Wu Ling San or Tiao Tian Shui San advised.</p>
<p>The diseases arising from the spleen, as stated in the classics, indicate that all dampness and swelling are related to the spleen&#39;s soil.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>When symptoms of the liver are present, initially caused by wind, with vomiting and diarrhea, accompanied by aversion to wind and fever, along with restlessness and anxiety, one should disperse these symptoms using the Xingsheng San. If vomiting and diarrhea occur first, followed by a transformation to slow and startled responses, it is untreatable.</p>
<p>When symptoms of the heart are present, such as fever and drowsiness, with frightful dreams, one should use the Dongyuan Anshen Wan to treat it. If there is thirst and a desire to drink water, one should use the Chen Sha Wuling San.</p>
<p>When symptoms of the lungs appear, with fever and drowsiness, and difficulty breathing accompanied by wheezing, one should use the Tingli Wan to address it.</p>
<p>When symptoms of the kidneys are evident, such as emaciation and weakness, with a propensity to lie down and an inability to rise, one should supplement both the spleen and kidneys. To replenish the kidneys, one should use the Dihuang Wan; to replenish the spleen, the Yangpi Wan should be used. If diarrhea persists and results in bloody pus, it is fatal. The kidneys are the source of vital energy; if they are deficient, the constitution will be insufficient. The spleen is responsible for the production of qi; if it is weak, this leads to a deficiency of fluids. Therefore, among children’s diseases of the five organs, the spleen and kidneys are most affected, followed by the liver and heart, with the lungs being the least affected.</p>
<p>The lungs govern wheezing; in cases of excess, there will be chaotic wheezing and difficulty breathing, accompanied by a desire for water, or even refusal to drink; in cases of deficiency, there may be constricted breathing and prolonged exhalation. In cases of excess, the Xie Bai San and Tingli Wan should be used to purge, while in cases of deficiency, Ejiao San and Sheng Mai San combined with Gan Ju Tang should be used to supplement.</p>
<p>All wheezing and shortness of breath, coughing, and facial swelling, are fundamental diseases of the lungs and should be treated with the modified Xie Bai San.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Two qian of balloon flower root and windbreak herb, one qian of licorice, and one qian and two fen of earth bone bark. </p>
<p>Diseases of the lungs, according to the classics, say: all ascending qi and reverse breath belong to the lungs. If liver signs are also present, caused by wind stroke, with clear nasal discharge and aversion to wind along with cough and wheezing, it is advisable to disperse, using a modified Shen-Su decoction. If there is a chronic cough that transforms into a wind disease, it should not be treated. As referred to by the Qian family, three purges of the liver will not alleviate liver disease, and three tonifications of the lungs will still leave lung symptoms particularly deficient.</p>
<p>If there are also heart symptoms, with fever, thirst, and chaotic breathing, this indicates excessive heart fire. It is advisable to use Cool Diaphragm Powder with added Zhimu and gypsum. For a persistent cough, a recipe of Huanglian and Ejiao pills is suitable. Huanglian and red Poria can suppress heart fire, leading to liver purification.</p>
<p>If there are also spleen symptoms, causing cough and expectoration, this indicates damage from dairy and food, leading to unsettled cough. It is advisable to use Tingli pills or Little Xiantian pills with added Dahuang. </p>
<p>If there are also kidney symptoms: the kidneys are the water organ, receiving and storing the fluids from the five organs and six bowels. Fluids enter the heart as sweat, the liver as tears, the lungs as nasal discharge, the spleen as saliva, and the kidneys as essence.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Coughing with an abundance of phlegm indicates that the essence of the kidneys is not returning to the source. It is advisable to use the Rehmannia Six Formula as the main treatment, supplemented with ingredients like prepared Morinda root, stir-fried Eucommia bark, and liquor-washed Cistanche, along with stir-fried fennel and stir-fried Euphorbia herbs, ground into a powder and formed into honey pills, then taken with a decoction of Ophiopogon.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern the void, not the solid. The Rehmannia formula addresses this. However, in cases of smallpox where the kidneys are solid, this notion is not articulated by the Qian family but is an error of the record-keeper, and it is unclear. To clarify doubts for future generations, there exist formulas to drain the kidneys, such as the Baixiang pill. There are also theories for tonifying the spleen and draining the kidneys, which may lead to children&#39;s misfortunes; thus, relying entirely on books is less beneficial than having none at all.</p>
<p>The human body consists of the lungs governing the skin and hair, the heart governing blood vessels, the spleen governing muscles, the liver governing tendons, and the kidneys governing the marrow. The kidneys, among the five organs, are akin to winter among the four seasons. The poison of sores and rashes emerges from the marrow, affecting the muscles, blood vessels, and skin, similar to how seasonal goods accumulate in winter, then disperse to give rise to spring life, summer growth, and autumn storage.</p>
<p>If it turns black and returns to the kidneys, it cannot disperse outward but instead retreats inward; this reflects a deficiency of true qi in the kidneys and an excess of pathogenic qi. Hence, formulas like the Baixiang pill and Niu Li syrup are established to dispel the pathogenic qi from within the kidneys, not to deplete the true qi. Moreover, the water in the kidneys nourishes and strengthens, filled with fluids.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>For black and sunken rashes, it indicates the kidneys are primarily deficient, where water cannot overcome fire, and fluids are dried up, leading to a blackened appearance that sinks inward. The treatment of such conditions is to drain excess fluids to save fire. </p>
<p>All deficiencies and weaknesses, particularly in those with poor constitution from pregnancy, are diseases of the kidneys. After illness affecting the five organs occurs, if there is kidney deficiency, use Di Huang Wan with modifications according to symptoms. Rashes related to the kidneys may require both draining and tonifying.</p>
<p>Regarding kidney-related illnesses, Qian&#39;s theory states: the kidneys are the source of deficiency, manifesting from insufficient prenatal endowment. </p>
<p>If there are also liver symptoms, such as convulsions and limb paralysis, use Di Huang Wan with the addition of two liang each of Niu Xi, Dang Gui, and Xu Duan, and one liang of powdered cinnamon, making into honey pills for consumption. </p>
<p>If heart symptoms present, with convulsions and loss of voice, use Di Huang Wan added with two liang each of Shi Chang Pu, Bai Zi Ren, and Yuan Zhi, grinding them into powder to create honey pills. </p>
<p>For spleen symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and dysentery, employ Di Huang Wan with two liang each of Huang Lian and Huang Bai stir-fried in wine, and one liang each of stir-fried Gan Jiang, Che Qian Zi, ground Nutmeg, making into a honey pill for ingestion.</p>
<p>In cases with lung symptoms, where cough includes blood-stained phlegm, use Di Huang Wan with two liang each of Tian Men Dong, Mai Men Dong (roasted), Zhi Mu, Huang Bai prepared with honey water, and roasted Ejiao for honey pill preparation.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>According to the methods of supplementing and draining based on the strengths and weaknesses of the five organs, we interpret the classics. The classics say: when the evil qi is abundant, it is real; when the true qi is lost, it is deficient. The so-called &quot;real&quot; refers to the expelling of evil qi; the &quot;deficient&quot; refers to the replenishing of true qi. When true qi is robust, one is like a healthy child, how can there be a need to drain? If the liver is often in excess and the spleen often deficient, this indicates the inherent qi of the organs. The liver represents the lesser yang qi; at the birth of a child, like a tree budding, it embodies the growing energy of the lesser yang, gradually strengthening, hence its abundance. The intestines and stomach are delicate and thin, and the essence of grain is not yet sufficient, which accounts for the spleen&#39;s deficiency.</p>
<p>When infants exhibit bright and clear colors and have a strong, resonant voice, this indicates sufficient heart and lung qi. When they are able to consume milk and food, with regulated bowel movements, this shows adequate qi in the intestines and stomach. When the hands and feet are warm, and the muscles and bones are strong, this indicates sufficient kidney and liver qi. This is known as being easy to care for when free from illness, and indiscriminate use of medicine is unwise.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the complexion is pale and the voice is soft, this indicates insufficiency in heart and lung. If milk and food intake decreases and there are frequent vomiting and diarrhea, this shows insufficiency in the intestines and stomach. If the neck is soft, and the hands and feet are weak, this indicates insufficiency in liver and kidney. Such children are often ill and difficult to nurture. This distinguishes between the strengths and weaknesses of the five organs based on physical condition. For those who are ill, treatment should follow the specific strengths and weaknesses of the five organs.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Internal Organ Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The method of treatment is generally as follows: for liver diseases, the priority is to dispel wind and regulate qi; for heart diseases, the urgent approach is to suppress fire and tranquilize disturbances; for spleen diseases, it is necessary to warm the middle and resolve stagnation; for lung diseases, the focus is on descending qi and clearing phlegm; and for kidney diseases, the aim is to replenish true essence. This outlines the main principles of treatment. </p>
<p>If lung disease also presents with liver symptoms, where one grinds their teeth and yawns frequently, it is easier to treat, as liver deficiency can’t support the lung. However, if one is crying out sharply with a stiff neck and irritability, treatment becomes difficult. This is because prolonged lung disease leads to deficiency and coldness, while a strong liver can overpower the lung. Treatment should consider the freshness, duration, deficiency, and excess of the illness: for deficiency, nourish the mother; for excess, drain the child. </p>
<p>The liver, being primarily affected by wind, leads to yawning and irritability, along with heat in the mouth, which should be dispersed using Daqinggucao. If appetite is present and water intake is excessive, a small dose of Dahuangwan should be given, without excess purging. If there’s liver heat causing one to fidget with their clothing or twist objects, Xieqingwan is appropriate. For strong fever, excessive drinking, and wheezing, Bai San should be administered. When liver diseases overshadow the lung, particularly in autumn, where a strong liver prevails over a weak lung, it is necessary to tonify the spleen to treat the liver. Strengthening the spleen enables the mother to fortify the child. Use Bu spleen Yihuang San to treat liver with Xieqingwan.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>When the liver has wind, the eyes blink excessively without spasming; if heat arises from the heart, then spasms occur. The treatment is with Qing Wan for liver excess and Dao Chi San for heart issues. When the liver has heat, the eyes direct their gaze without spasming; the same treatment applies. When the liver is affected by wind, the body becomes stiff and straight, not spasming, and warmth does not affect the heart; in such cases, one should tonify the kidneys to treat the liver. The main treatment is with Di Huang Wan for kidney tonification and Qing Wan for liver excess. Regardless of whether the illness is new or chronic, it all stems from the movement of liver wind, which directs its action towards the head and eyes. The eyes pertain to the liver; when wind enters the eyes, they flutter lightly as if blown by wind, making it difficult for the child to remain still, hence the excessive blinking. If heat enters the eyes, it pulls on their tendons and both corners become tense, making it impossible to turn the gaze, hence the fixed stare. If accompanied by heart heat, spasms occur because both the mother (heart) and child (liver) possess real heat, leading to the clash of wind and fire. </p>
<p>In autumn, liver conditions are observed as the wood element strengthens the liver, overpowering the lungs. Therefore, it is advisable to tonify the lungs and drain the liver. In mild cases, liver issues alleviate; in severe cases, there may be pallor of the lips and death. </p>
<p>When there is heart heat, sleep is affected, and the breath feels warm within the mouth. Sometimes, there is a tendency to sleep with the face covered, and there may be grinding of teeth at night—all indicative of heart heat, for which Dao Chi San is the main treatment. When heart qi is heated, the chest also feels warm, creating an urge to speak but resulting in a desire to remain still as if feeling cold, hence the tendency to sleep face down. If heart qi is full, it creates a blockage of qi movement, and sleeping in a compact position hinders flow, thus one prefers to sleep on one’s back to allow for unobstructed upward and downward movement of qi; accordingly, Xie Xin San is the main treatment.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>Heart disease appears in winter; when fire is strong and the heart overcomes the kidney, one must tonify the kidney and treat the heart. In mild cases, the disease retreats; in severe cases, there is a descent without speech, indicating a weak and deficient kidney. </p>
<p>When the spleen and stomach are not harmonious, the face appears pale and lacks vitality, the breath is cold, there is no appetite, and one vomits water; one must tonify the spleen, using Yihuang San as the main treatment. If the spleen and stomach are deficient and cold, the face is pale, thin, and weak, with abdominal pain and loss of appetite; one must tonify the spleen, using Yihuang San. For diarrhea, use Tiaozhong Wan; if there is a cold from wind, with cold limbs, the spleen is weak; one must harmonize the spleen, then disperse the cold. Harmonizing the spleen with Yihuang San, disperse using Daqing Wan as the main treatment. For spleen diseases, address all nearby conditions in this manner. Those with a favorable disposition are easier to treat, while those with an unfavorable disposition are harder to treat. Weakness of the spleen may present with a reddened yellow face; treat the corresponding organ according to the symptoms.</p>
<p>If there is excess lung condition along with cold wind, with fullness in the chest, shortness of breath, gasping, and wheezing, one must first disperse the lung and then release the cold wind. To disperse the lung, use Xiebai San as the main treatment. If the lung is only injured by cold, there will not be fullness in the chest; if there is heat in the lung, the hands may press against the eyebrows, eyes, nose, and face, treated with Ganjiao Tang. For lung deficiency with heat, resulting in deep red lips, treat by dispersing lung deficiency heat with a smaller dose of Xiebai San. If the lung is weak and the lips are pale, one must tonify the lung, using Ejiao San as the main treatment.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If one experiences agitation, coarse breathing, and wheezing, it is difficult to treat due to lung deficiency. Chronic spleen and lung disease leads to deficiency, resulting in pale lips. The spleen is the mother of the lungs; when both are deficient, they cannot nourish each other, hence the term &quot;timid.&quot; The lungs correspond to the lips; if the lips are pale and lustrous, it is a good sign, but if they are white like dry bones, it foretells death. Lung diseases that appear in spring indicate that the lungs overpower the liver; thus, one should tonify the kidneys and liver and treat the lungs. If the liver is weak, it leads to illness. To tonify the liver and kidneys, use Di Huang Wan; for treating the lungs, use Xie Bai San. In spring, if lung ailments arise and the lungs are robust, one should purge the lungs. In mild cases, the lung disease will recede; in severe cases, pale blue eyes may indicate fright. Additionally, if redness appears, it suggests a weak liver, which is also indicated by pale blue eyes.</p>
<p>A child with kidney deficiency is originally weak and timid, due to insufficient prenatal energy resulting in insufficient vital essence. Such children have often white sclera, a reflective forehead, a wide face, and a pale complexion, all of which are difficult to nurture, typically living only up to 88 days. If one indulges excessively in desires, they may not survive beyond 40 days. Some may develop kidney deficiency due to illness, which is not part of this discourse. Furthermore, insufficient kidney energy leads to sinking; certainly, heavy bones desire to drop down and hunch the body. The kidneys represent yin; thus, kidney deficiency causes light sensitivity, so one should tonify the kidneys with Di Huang Wan. When kidney ailments present in summer, water overcomes fire; the kidneys overpower the heart, and one should purge the kidneys. In mild cases, the illness may recede; in severe cases, palpitations may occur as well.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>On the Liver</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang states: The liver governs wind. When it is full, there will be loud shouting and urgency in the neck, causing annoyance. When it is deficient, one may grind their teeth and yawn. If there is heat in the Qi, wind arises externally; if the Qi is warm, wind arises internally, to be treated with Daqing Gao. If one can continue to eat and drink without interruption, use Dahuang Wan to gently purge. If the liver is hot, the eyes will bulge without twitching, and the hands will fidget with clothing or twist items. Use Xieqing Wan to treat this. If there is strong heat, resulting in thirst and shortness of breath, Xie Bai San should be administered. </p>
<p>Liver ailments appear in autumn; if the lung is weak and cannot support the liver, benefit the spleen with Yihuang San, and Xieqing Wan should be used to treat the liver. If there is wind in the liver, the eyes will blink rapidly. If heart heat causes twitching, use Xieqing Wan for the liver, and Daohong San for the heart. In severe cases, the body may arch back, the eyes bulge without twitching, the heart is not affected by heat; use Dihuang Wan to nourish the kidneys, and Xieqing Wan to treat the liver. Those with pale lips should not be treated. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhang Jiegu states: The liver governs wind; if ill, it will cause wind to convulse and tense. If heart is strong in the liver, it is a pathogenic evil; if the lung seizes the liver, it is a thief evil; if the kidney regulates the liver, it is a deficiency evil. In all cases of liver illness, one must first examine the lungs and kidneys. The kidney is the mother of the liver; the lung is the thief of the liver. </p>
<p>Hence, if the liver is ill, and it is not due to the kidney water&#39;s inability to generate it, it is likely due to the lung&#39;s metal demon harming it. Therefore, if the cause is in the lungs, first treat the lungs and attack the demon; if the cause is in the kidneys, first nourish the kidneys to replenish the source. Then, assess the condition of the primary organ for emptiness or fullness and for cold or warmth. I secretly believe that if there are symptoms of excess heat in the liver channel leading to external wind, it is suitable to use Daqing Gao for treatment.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>If after taking the medicine the symptoms still worsen, it indicates that the evil qi has left but the spleen qi is deficient. In this case, it is advisable to use Yigong San with additional Xiangfu and Angelica for replenishment. If there is liver channel deficiency heat, or internal wind generated from oppression and constriction, Yigong San and Di Huang Wan should be used for nourishment. If wind evil has entered the organs and causes cold food intake and constipation, this indicates internal excess of evil qi; thus, it is appropriate to use Dahuang Wan to purge it. If after purging there is a reduced appetite and an abdominal distension, this indicates internal deficiency of spleen qi; hence, Baizhu San should be used for replenishment. </p>
<p>If one has naturally weak qi and blood, possibly due to a post-illness condition, or from taking purgatives, and they often seek their collar, grind their teeth, yawn, and have pale eyes, this points to severe liver channel deficiency; therefore, Di Huang Wan should be urgently used to nourish the kidney and liver. If there are symptoms of choking breath, shortness of breath, and prolonged exhalation, this indicates severe lung channel deficiency; Yigong San should be urgently utilized to nourish spleen and lung. </p>
<p>If one cries out during the Shen (3-5 PM) and You (5-7 PM) hours, stares blankly, yawns irritably, feels anxious, and has shaky hands and feet, with a fever and thirst, this is due to the clash of wind and fire overpowering lung metal. Chaihu Zhi Zi San should be used to treat liver fire and promote liver blood; Yigong San should nourish spleen earth and promote lung metal. </p>
<p>If the lips appear pale, this indicates extreme spleen deficiency and is untreatable. For infants, symptoms often arise from the mother&#39;s indulgent diet, inappropriate breastfeeding, or due to the nurse’s diet causing agitation. Once the disease qi has manifested and the physical form is deficient, one should ascertain the cause and administrate herbs including Lu Lu to treat the mother while the child takes one or two spoonfuls. Afterward, continue in this manner.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>The Heart</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang said: The heart governs fright; when it is strong, it manifests as crying, fever, drinking water, and convulsions; when it is weak, it leads to fatigue, restlessness, and palpitations. He also stated: When there is heat, the breath during sleep is warm, and one may grind their teeth or sleep with their face up, showing a tendency to cool down, which indicates heart heat; this is treated with Daohong San. If one sleeps on their back, it indicates strong heart qi, and the qi cannot circulate up and down; this requires Xiexin San for treatment. Heart issues manifest in winter, showing that fire overcomes water; one should nourish the kidneys to treat the heart, and mild cases may resolve on their own. If there is downward descent and silence, it indicates kidney deficiency and timidity. Furthermore, Zhang Jieguh stated: The heart governs heat; if the lungs invade the heart, it creates a slight pathogenic influence; if the liver invades the heart, it results in a deficiency; if the spleen invades the heart, it results in a real pathogenic influence; if the kidneys invade the heart, it leads to a thieving influence. Whenever the heart becomes ill, it is essential to first adjust the liver and kidneys. When liver qi flows smoothly, heart qi becomes harmonious; when liver qi is stagnant, heart qi becomes weak. Thus, for heart issues, one must first seek to address the liver and clear the source.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>When the five organs suffer illness, the disease will inevitably transmit to the organ it overcomes. The evil affecting the kidneys must transmit to the heart, hence one should first treat the kidneys to dispel the evil. Only when the liver and kidney channels are harmonized can one then assess the true and false conditions of the heart for treatment. I modestly believe that those who sleep on their backs do so because their chest is full of heat, thus they prefer to lie back and seek the empty space. Those who prefer to lie face down do so because their chest is deficient and hot, hence they prefer to lie prone to seek fullness. If it’s a case of fullness, one should adjust and treat the heart and liver; if it’s a case of deficiency, one should tonify the spleen and lungs. These two conditions should be distinguished clearly. Symptoms, such as teeth grinding, may share similarities and do not require rigid adherence to specifics. If one uses formulas like Xie Xin and Dao Chi, although the evil qi is dispelled, the illness persists; one must then tonify the vital qi. If the situation worsens, one must urgently warm and tonify the vital qi. If heart qi appears in winter, or if at the time of the Pig or Rat hours the illness worsens, or if there is a reluctance to speak, this indicates deficiency of kidney water and excess of heart fire; one should use Di Huang Wan. For infants under mother’s care, it is necessary for the mother to take it.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Spleen</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang states: The spleen governs the condition of being troubled; actually, it refers to trouble in sleep and body heat, whether drinking water or not. In cases of distress, vomiting and diarrhea arise from wind. If the spleen and stomach are deficient and cold, the face appears pale and weak, the eyes lack brightness, the breath from the mouth and nose is cold, the body is thin and weak, there is vomiting, abdominal pain, and a lack of desire for food; benefit can be gained from the Use of Huang San; for bowel movements, use the Tiao Zhong Wan. If there are cold hands and feet due to a wind affliction, it indicates a weakness of the spleen. First use Huang San to replenish the spleen, then use Da Qing Gao to disperse it. Spleen diseases manifest similarly across the four seasons. Those in harmony are easier to treat, while those against the flow are hard to treat. A weak spleen may present with a red or yellow face; if it also interacts with the five organs, treat according to the symptoms. Moreover, Zhang Jiegu states: The spleen governs dampness; when sick, there is often diarrhea and excessive sleep, with a heavy and lethargic body. If the liver invades the spleen, it is a thief&#39;s evil; if the heart invades the spleen, it is a void&#39;s evil; if the lung invades the spleen, it is a real evil; if the kidney invades the spleen, it is a minor evil. In all spleen diseases, one must first investigate the liver and heart organs. Indeed, the liver is the ghost of the spleen, and the heart is the mother of the spleen.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>When liver qi is excessive, ghostly evils persist; when heart qi is deficient, vitality is insufficient. One should harmonize liver qi and nourish heart qi. If the pulse indicates that both liver and heart are harmonious, then the spleen is affected, and one should assess the deficiency and excess to treat it. I suspect that in cases of actual evidence, the pathogenic qi is excessive while the vital qi is deficient. If the complexion is pallid, with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and the breath is cold from the mouth and nose, this pertains to cold water invading earth, and one should use Yi Huang San. If the complexion is bluish and lips dark, with vomiting, diarrhea, and cold in the hands and feet, this indicates spleen deficiency with cold, and one should use Gan Jiang Li Zhong Tang. If the complexion is sallow-yellow, and the hands and feet are not cold, this indicates a weak spleen, and one should use Ren Shen Li Zhong Tang. If there is a wind condition with cold in the hands and feet, expectoration, coughing, and diarrhea with abdominal distension, this indicates a deficiency in both spleen and lung qi, and one should use Wu Wei Yi Gong San to strengthen spleen qi, adding Fang Feng and Sheng Ma to expel external evils. If it arises during the time of Yin and Mao, one should use Liu Jun Zi, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma to nourish spleen earth and pacify liver wood. However, a yellow complexion is the natural color of the spleen. A red complexion indicates fire generating earth, which is harmonious; a bluish complexion indicates wood conquering earth, which is disharmonious. One should harmonize what overcomes to replenish the original qi effectively.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Lung</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang said: The lungs govern shortness of breath. When they are full, there is a sensation of fullness and rapid, chaotic breathing, sometimes accompanied by drinking water. When they are deficient, there is a feeling of blockage and shortness of breath. If the lungs are excessive and then attacked by wind-cold, there will be fullness in the chest and urgent, wheezing breath; this can be treated with Xie Bai San. If there is lung heat, pressing on the forehead, eyes, nose, and face will help; use Gan Ju Tang. If the lung deficiency causes heat, the lips will appear deep red; use Xie Bai San sparingly. If there is a weak lung, the lips will be pale; use Ejiao San. If there is a sensation of fullness and rapid, chaotic breathing leading to blockage, it is difficult to treat. If the condition is prolonged and the lips are white, it indicates deficiency in both spleen and lungs. If the lips are white like pig fat, it is auspicious; if they are white like dry bone, it indicates death. If lung disease appears in spring, the lungs are stronger than the liver. Use Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys, along with Xie Bai San to treat the lungs. If the eyes appear pale blue, it indicates imminent shock; if red, it indicates a weak liver. Moreover, Zhang Jiego stated: The lungs govern dryness; when they are affected, there is coughing and wheezing; thus, dryness must be moistened.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>If the heart dominates the lungs as a thief, the liver dominates the lungs as a mild evil, the kidneys dominate the lungs as a substantial evil, and the spleen dominates the lungs as a vacuous evil. When the lungs are afflicted, one must first observe the reality and vacuity of the heart and spleen. If heart fire scorches the metal element, one should suppress the heart and nourish the lungs. If the spleen’s qi is weak and cold, failing to support the lungs, and the lung qi is insufficient, then one is susceptible to wind evils, and it is advisable to tonify the spleen and lungs. If the spleen is solid and there is a sensation of fullness, with heat rising to the lungs, it is necessary to purge the spleen qi. If the heart and spleen are balanced yet the lungs are still ill, one must investigate the reality and vacuity for treatment. It is my view that for lung channel heat, one should use Xie Bai San; for lung qi deficiency, use Si Jun Zi Tang; for external evils invading, use Shen Su Yin; for heart fire blazing, use Ren Shen Ping Fei San; for solid fullness in the middle burner, use Da Cheng Qi; and if the spleen cannot nourish the lungs, use Yi Gong San. When lung qi is abundant, the evil qi within the lungs is also abundant; the pulse at the right inch will be superficial and strong, and it is appropriate to use Xie Bai San to drain it. If the lungs are deficient yet there is heat, clinging to the idea that lung heat injures the lungs and failing to use ginseng is a grave error; one should still apply ginseng according to certain conditions.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>The Kidney</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang said: The kidney governs the void and the real evidence; only when the pox and sores are real will they appear black and sunken. One must further differentiate between the evidence of the void and the real. For instance, if there is lung disease alongside liver symptoms, clenching teeth and yawning is easy to treat since the weakened liver cannot support the lung. However, if one stares directly, shouts, and cries, feeling restless and anxious, it is difficult to treat. This is because lung disease is cold and weak, while the liver is strong and real, overpowering the lung. </p>
<p>Assess the disease based on its new or long-standing condition, and whether it is void or real; if it is void, then nourish its mother, if it is real, then drain its child. The kidney is weakened due to insufficient prenatal energy, resulting in a diminished spirit, drooping eyelids, and a tendency for the eyes to be overly white, with a pale complexion, all of which are difficult to nourish, rarely exceeding eighty-eight years. If one indulges in sensual desires, they may perish before reaching forty. There are also cases where illness causes kidney weakness. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is said: insufficient kidney energy leads to downward descent. The weakened kidney causes heavy bones, resulting in a tendency to sag and hunch the body. Kidney water is yin; if the kidney is weak, the eyes lack luster and are sensitive to light, all of which can be treated with Rehmannia pills. Kidney disease appears in summer, as water conquers fire. For mild cases, the disease may resolve itself, but for severe cases, one should be alarmed by spasms and convulsions. </p>
<p>Zhang Jiego also stated: The kidney governs cold; from this disease, the feet and shins become cold and inversely affected. There is no real kidney condition; sores and rashes that are black and sunken represent reality and are the water controlling fire. If the heart invades the kidney, it becomes a subtle evil; if the lung invades the kidney, it is a void evil; if the liver invades the kidney, it is a real evil; if the spleen invades the kidney, it is a thieving evil.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>When the internal organs are weak and their proper functions are disrupted, harmful influences can invade, necessitating the reinforcement of the vital energy of the internal organs. If there are lung conditions like wheezing and cough arising in early spring, one should tonify the kidneys; if in summer, support the lungs; if in autumn, aid the spleen; and if in winter, tonify the heart while relieving the internal organs, which is referred to as a cold cough. Generally, when each of the five internal organs is in its rightful place, their energy is strong and no further tonification is required; while the areas affected by harmful influences should not be over-purged.</p>
<p>Among the five elements, it is only the kidneys (water) that, when strong, can suffer from external influences. This is because the lungs belong to metal, which emanates to the skin, governing the vital energy; while the kidneys belong to water, governing the bones and storing essence. The light and floating nature of qi can rise but cannot descend; the heavy and sinking nature of essence can descend but cannot rise, adhering to the properties of these substances.</p>
<p>Now, when the lung qi becomes heated and rises, it cannot descend to nourish the kidneys and is thus susceptible to harm, requiring urgent administration of cooling medicine to resolve it. The kidney qi must first seek the lungs. If dampness from the spleen affects the kidneys, it is necessary to eliminate the dampness from the spleen. However, if the spleen and lungs are balanced but the kidneys are actually diseased, one must examine the primary organ and treat it accordingly.</p>
<p>I surmise that conditions of downward sinking whereby the feet dislike being covered indicate that everything below the waist is governed by the kidneys, as the heart qi descends to the kidney region. The method is to use Rehmannia Six Formula to strengthen kidney water and control heart fire. If kidney water cannot be generated due to weakness of the spleen and lungs, one should use the Si Jun Zi Decoction and Rehmannia Six Formula to nourish the source of transformation. For sores and rashes that are dark and depressed, it indicates kidney deficiency with excess harmful qi, thus especially indicating the use of Rehmannia Six Formula.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>&quot;The Medical Mirror of Past and Present&quot; by Gong Xin (Ming Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>In the first month of pregnancy, it is referred to as &quot;white dew&quot;; in the second month, it is likened to &quot;peach blossom.&quot; When it reaches the third month, the right kidney produces a male, as the yin wraps around the yang; the left kidney produces a female, as the yang wraps around the yin. Then the kidneys give rise to the spleen, the spleen gives rise to the liver, the liver gives rise to the lungs, and the lungs give rise to the heart, thus generating those that overcome themselves. The kidneys belong to water, so the five organs are therefore yin. </p>
<p>Following this, the heart gives rise to the small intestine, the small intestine gives rise to the large intestine, the large intestine gives rise to the gallbladder, the gallbladder gives rise to the stomach, the stomach gives rise to the bladder, and the bladder gives rise to the three energizers, generating those that overcome their own nature. The small intestine belongs to fire, hence the six fu organs are therefore yang.</p>
<p>Next, the three energizers give rise to the eight vessels, the eight vessels give rise to the twelve meridians, the twelve meridians give rise to the twelve collaterals, the twelve collaterals give rise to one hundred eighty fine collaterals, the fine collaterals give rise to one hundred eighty entwined collaterals, the entwined collaterals give rise to thirty-four thousand sub-collaterals, the sub-collaterals give rise to three hundred sixty-five joints, the joints give rise to three hundred sixty-five major acupoints, and the major acupoints give rise to eighty-four thousand pores.

<p><strong>Medical Guidelines</strong> (Ming Dynasty, by Lou Ying)</p>
<p><strong>The Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The interdependence of the five organs leads to illnesses corresponding with seasonal changes. This reflects the expanded interpretations of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; on the method of conserving Qi, a concept previously unexplored. For instance, if liver disease manifests in spring or early morning, it indicates an inherent issue with the liver. If it later presents in autumn or late afternoon, corresponding to the lungs, and if the lungs are extremely deficient, the liver may prevail, thus requiring remedies for the spleen and lungs while draining the liver. I follow this principle accordingly. </p>
<p>The ancient texts state: Heat originates from the heart, cold from the kidneys, coughing rises from the lungs, wind from the liver, and diarrhea from the spleen. If diarrhea is accompanied by coughing and rising Qi, it indicates a spleen-lung condition, hence one should use a combination of Baihua and Yihuang powders. The spleen suffers from dampness, while the lungs suffer from dryness. If the Qi is reversed up and symptoms show diarrhea with a yellow complexion and rumbling intestines, one should take Lizhong Decoction. For those with diarrhea and vomiting, Fuling Banxia Decoction is advisable. If there is diarrhea with significant thirst and heat, Huangqin and Houpian Decoction is suitable. For those not thirsty but with less heat, Baizhu and Houpian Decoction should be used. Other combinations of the five organs should be extrapolated similarly. Further discussions will elaborate on seasonal approaches for medication.</p>
<p>The heart governs heat; if there is inherent or significant heat, Xiexin Decoction is prescribed. If it is excessive heat, Huanglian Xiexin Decoction is appropriate. In cases of deficiency leading to fright or palpitations, Shengxi San is used.</p>
<p>The lungs are influenced by the heart, presenting mild pathological factors such as wheezing with strong heat, in which case Xiebai Powder is utilized. The liver affects the heart with weak pathogenic factors, presenting with wind-heat; Da Qianghuo Decoction combined with Daqingwan is warranted.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The spleen dominates the heart; when it becomes excessive, it causes heat in the body, and the Yellow Scattering Powder is used to alleviate this. The kidneys affect the heart; if they bring an evil qi, it may lead to fear and aversion to cold, treated with the Anshen Pill. The lungs govern dryness; if ill, it results in coughing and wheezing; thus, dryness should be moistened. If excessive, it leads to wheezing with strong qi, treated with the White Scattering Powder. If deficient, there is wheezing with little qi, first use the Yellow Scattering Powder, followed by the Ejiao Powder.</p>
<p>The heart influences the lungs; if there is an evil qi, it brings heat and wheezing, managed first with the Dihuang Pill, then the Red Scattering Powder, followed by the Ejiao Powder. The liver affects the lungs; if slightly in disarray, it may cause aversion to wind, dizziness, and coughing, treated with the Qiang Huo Ointment. The kidneys impact the lungs; if excessive, they provoke aversion to cold and clear cough, managed with the Baibu Pill. The spleen influences the lungs; if deficient, it leads to heaviness, phlegm, diarrhea, and coughing, treated with the Ginseng and Atractylodes Powder.</p>
<p>The liver governs wind; if ill, it results in convulsions or spasms. If the liver is in distress, consuming sweet foods helps to alleviate it, combined with sour and bitter to disperse. If excessive, it produces strong convulsions, treated with the Qing Pill. If deficient, it results in weaker convulsions, managed with the Dihuang Pill.</p>
<p>The heart affects the liver; if in excess, it brings vigorous heat and convulsions, treated with the Lijing Pill and Liangjing Pill. The lungs impact the liver; if evil qi is present and qi is strong, it results in yawning and slight convulsions; lung drainage is necessary, starting with tonifying the organ. For reinforcing the liver, the Dihuang Pill is used; for draining the lungs, the White Scattering Powder is needed. The spleen influences the liver; if slightly affected, it leads to excessive sleep and heaviness, and convulsions must first be stabilized, treated with the Qing Pill. If convulsions stop and other symptoms reappear, then a separate method should be established for treatment. The kidneys affect the liver; if deficient, they bring aversion to cold and yawning with convulsions, treated with the Qiang Huo Ointment.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The spleen governs dampness; when it is ill, there is often diarrhea, excessive sleep, and a feeling of heaviness and fatigue. The spleen suffers from dampness, so bitter foods should be consumed to dry it out. In cases of excessive dampness, diarrhea appears red and yellow, with closed eyes while sleeping; for this, Ban Xia and Huang Qi Decoction is used. In cases of deficiency, diarrhea is pale, with eyes open during sleep; for this, Bai Zhu Decoction is used.</p>
<p>The liver influences the spleen, causing evildoers, wind, diarrhea, and vomiting; for this, Fu Ling and Ban Xia Decoction is used. The heart affects the spleen, resulting in deficiency and heat, with heaviness and diarrhea; for this, Qiang Huo, Huang Qin, Cang Zhu, and Gan Cao Decoction is used. The lung influences the spleen, causing excessive conditions where food is consumed but leads to no bowel movements, and vomiting and coughing occur; for this, a decoction of areca nut and rhubarb is used, along with Ding Li pills. The kidney affects the spleen, causing mild evildoers, coldness, and diarrhea; for this, formulas like Li Zhong Wan are used.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern coldness; when they are ill, the legs and shins feel cold and inverted. Among the five organs, only the kidneys do not have an excess. If a child’s rash turns black and sinks, this indicates that the kidneys have excess water, countering heart fire.</p>
<p>The heart influences the kidneys, causing mild evildoers, internal heat without aversion to cold; for this, Gui Zhi Decoction is used. The lung affects the kidneys, leading to deficiency, wheezing, coughing with cold; for this, Bai Bu pills are used. The liver influences the kidneys, causing excess conditions with tightness and cold; for this, Li Zhong Wan is used. The spleen affects the kidneys, causing evildoers, heaviness, diarrhea, and cold; for this, Li Zhong Wan is also used.</p>
<p>In cases where the five organs are weak, it signifies that the proper regulation is not functioning, thus being harmed by external evildoers. It is important to replenish the upright qi of the original organ. For instance, if there is lung disease with wheezing and coughing appearing in early spring, one should tonify the kidneys. In summer, address the lung; in autumn, involve the lung with diarrhea; and in winter, tonify the heart while addressing the original organ, also known as cold diarrhea.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>In general, when the five organs reach their natural states, the qi is abundant and cannot be further supplemented, while those that are subdued cannot be further drained. According to Jie Gu, liver disease manifests as a pale face, lung disease as a red face, spleen disease as a bluish face, kidney disease as a yellow face, and heart disease as a dark face. If liver disease presents with sudden shocks or convulsions, along with a pale face and symptoms like phlegm, saliva, and shortness of breath, these are difficult to treat. I infer similar cases from this.</p>
<p>For instance, before the spring equinox, when the wind is cold, one should use Rehmannia, Qianghuo, and Fengfeng, or take Rehmannia pills and alternate with Qingxia decoction. After the spring equinox, when the wind is warm, one should use Qianghuo, Fengfeng, and Huangqin, or take Qingxia pills and Daohong powder. After the summer begins, when it&#39;s hot, one should use Sanhuang pills and Daohong powder. After the summer solstice, when it&#39;s humid and hot, one should take a combination of Daohong powder and Xiehuang powder, or similar herbs like Huangqin, Ginseng, and Muxiang. After the autumn equinox, use Xiebai powder, and after the arrival of winter, use Rehmannia pills as a primary treatment, which is not subject to drainage.</p>
<p>Haicang states that for Liver Nourishment Pills: within the Siwu Decoction, add Fengfeng and Qianghuo in equal parts, ground into a fine powder, and then formed into honey pills. For the Liver Calming Pills: Xieqing pills, excluding Gardenia and Rhubarb, are used to treat liver deficiency. For the Kidney Draining Pills: they target a full and strong pulse, namely the aforementioned Rehmannia pills, substituting freshly prepared Rehmannia instead of the cooked version, and excluding Corni fruits. This treats the pulse of the left wrist. If the right wrist pulse is strong and full, use Fengsui Dan to drain it. The Rehmannia pills mentioned are the same as the Eight Flavor Pills by Zhang Zhongjing, minus cinnamon and aconite. If added with Schisandra, it becomes the Kidney Qi Pills, which nourish the lung&#39;s source and generate kidney water.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p>
<h3>Medical Connections Between the Organs</h3>
<p>The heart is connected to the tongue. The heart is an organ, and the small intestine is a cavity. Its color is red and it is dominant during the three months of summer. The heart tastes bitter, its fluid is sweat, it governs blood, its voice is speech, and its energy is breath. When in excess, it leads to laughter; when deficient, it results in worry. According to &quot;Qianjin,&quot; when the heart’s energy is full, one laughs incessantly; when it is empty, one weeps continuously.</p>
<p>The liver is connected to the eyes. The liver is an organ, and the gallbladder is a cavity. Its color is green, and it is dominant during the three months of spring. The liver tastes sour, its fluid is tears, it governs the tendons, its voice is weeping, and its energy is exhaled breath. When in excess, it leads to anger; when deficient, it results in sadness. According to &quot;Qianjin,&quot; anger is fullness, while sadness is emptiness.</p>
<p>The spleen is connected to the lips and mouth. The spleen is an organ, and the stomach is a cavity. Its color is yellow, and it is dominant during the four seasonal months. The spleen tastes sweet, its fluid is saliva, it governs the muscles, its voice is singing, and its energy is breath. When in excess, it leads to a feeling of fullness in the abdomen; when deficient, there is a lack of energy.</p>
<p>The lungs are connected to the nostrils. The lungs are an organ, and the large intestine is a cavity. Its color is white, and it is dominant during the three months of autumn. The lungs taste spicy, their fluid is mucus, they govern energy internally and the skin externally, their voice is weeping, and their energy is gasping. When in excess, it leads to wheezing; when deficient, it results in sighing.</p>
<p>The kidneys are connected to the ears. The kidneys are an organ, and the bladder is a cavity. Its color is black, and it is dominant during the three months of winter. The kidneys taste salty, their fluid is saliva, they govern the bones, their voice is groaning, and their energy is weakness. When in excess, it leads to diarrhea; when deficient, it results in cold extremities.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a></p>
<h3>The Five Organs and Their Pathologies</h3>
<p>When the heart is ill, the eyes become dark; the kidney injures the heart, leading to extreme deficiency of the water element (ren and gui). When the liver is ill, the skin becomes dark; the lung injures the liver, causing a deficiency of the metal element (geng and xin). When the spleen is ill, the lips turn cyan; the liver injures the spleen, resulting in deficiency of the wood element (jia and yi). When the lung is ill, the cheeks swell and the eyes turn red; the heart injures the lung, causing deficiency of the fire element (bing and ding). When the kidney is ill, the face swells and the lips turn yellow; the spleen injures the kidney, resulting in deficiency of the earth element (wu and ji).</p>
<h3>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiegugu stated: The five organs have a relationship of mother and child between deficiency and excess; the ghosts and thieves are subtle or apparent. If the intent is not reached, it becomes difficult to enter. The excess pathologies are in the front; the child can now cause the mother to be excessive, repelling the thieves that harm the mother. The child also calls for assistance from what the mother restrains, hence termed as excess pathology. The deficient pathologies are in the back; the mother brings the child’s ghost and thief, as the mother can cause the child to be deficient too. </p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: The child can cause the mother to be excessive, and the mother can cause the child to be deficient. This is what it&#39;s referring to. When the wife comes to dominate the husband, that’s termed a subtle pathology; when the husband comes to dominate the wife, that’s termed a thieving pathology. The treatment should focus on dispelling the ghosts and nourishing the root organ. When the root organ itself is ill, this is the proper and improper pathology. If it’s deficient, then nourish it; if it’s excessive, then drain it. The classic states: To nourish the sprouts, one must secure the roots; to cut from the bottom, one must dry out the top. To reverse the roots and cut at the base will ruin the true essence.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>If the liver prevails over the lungs, it leads to liver disease, with body heat causing convulsions, and signs of lung deficiency appear. When one experiences wheezing and shortness of breath, and the illness manifests during the hours of Shen, You, or Xu, this indicates a strong liver. The classics say: to be constrained and yet unable to control is termed true strength. The appropriate treatment is to tonify the spleen and lungs while draining the liver, using Daohong San and Xie Huang San as primary remedies. </p>
<p>Liu Zonghou pointed out that all of this relates to the five organs overcoming each other, with the pathological mechanisms closely tied to the principles of generation and overcoming in the five elements. Infants, upon first entering the swaddling, have not yet developed the seven emotions and six desires; they are merely physically fragile, with unsettled blood and qi, and their organ spirits are incomplete, leading to conditions of deficient and excessive organ energy. However, common practice often overlooks this principle, frequently attributing such cases to external pathogens or internal injuries and thus leading to many wrongful deaths. How tragic! The writings of the Qian family sometimes miss key points, yet fortunately, Jie Gu has supplemented them. Now, I have specifically added these discussions, which are truly of boundless benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Methods of Supplementing and Draining the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>Qian said: Whenever there is an initial deficiency, or it has already descended, one must first treat the mother organ before draining the child organ. For example, if the lungs are deficient but phlegm is excessive, this is an indication for purging; one should first benefit the spleen and then proceed to drain the lungs. The Xie Qing Wan is also known as Xie Gan Wan.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>Qian states that there are no methods to nourish the liver, thus there are no liver-nourishing medicines. Wang Haizang made a refined honey pill from the Siwu Decoction, adding Fangfeng and Qianghuo, naming it the Liver Nourishing Pill. He also created the Zhen Gan Pill by removing Zhizi and Dahuang from the Xieqing Pill to treat liver deficiency. Daohong San disperses heat in the small intestine.</p>
<p>Xiexin Decoction drains the heart.</p>
<p>Anshen Wan treats heart deficiency with symptoms of heat, causing the spirit to be confused and disoriented.</p>
<p>Haizang&#39;s Babushisan stabilizes the mind and is a proper heart tonic.</p>
<p>Yihuang San, also known as Bupi San, is said by Haizang to tonify the spleen and dry dampness. Dongyuan notes it treats cold dampness in the stomach, nausea, abdominal pain, and is a holy medicine for diarrhea with clear discharge. </p>
<p>Xiehuang San, also known as Xiepisan, is noted by Haizang to drain heat from the spleen.</p>
<p>Ejiao San, also called Bulei San, as stated by Haizang, treats the lungs. Xingren primarily drains the lungs, unlike ginseng, Asparagus adscendens, or Ophiopogon japonicus.</p>
<p>Xie Bai San, also named Xie Fei San, according to Haizang, addresses lung heat with symptoms of bone steaming and spontaneous sweating, directly draining this condition. Zhizi and Huangqin also drain the lungs, differentiating between qi and blood.</p>
<p>Dihuang Wan is simply the Jinkui Eight Ingredients Pill without Gui and Fu. Haizang claims it treats kidney deficiency leading to headaches, particularly for sallow symptoms and the pulse being weak.</p>
<p>Qian argues that there are no draining methods for the kidneys, hence no kidney-draining medicines. Haizang&#39;s Xie Shen Wan treats a full and robust pulse, similar to the prior Dihuang Wan, substituting Shudihuang for Shengdihuang and omitting Sanjue. This addresses the primary pulse of the left hand. If the right pulse is full and strong, treat it with Fengsui Dan.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Li Chen)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Symptoms of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>Liver wind: eyes fixed, hands circling and twisting.<br>[Note: Qi heat is an external injury of wind, while Qi warmness is wind produced internally. When there is heat, both canthi tighten and do not move. If the eyes are fixed and have a bluish hue, it will surely cause fright; severe teeth grinding also induces fright. The liver governs planning, which is why one circles around the collar and randomly twists objects. If the wind is strong, the body becomes resilient and tense, resulting in blue discharge. The heart is affected when wind and fire clash, causing convulsions and red dispersions. Thirst and wheezing produce white dispersions.] If there is deficiency, then there will be teeth grinding and yawning.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>&quot;Notes: When the heart does not receive heat, and there is twitching without convulsion, or the convulsion is mild, both should be treated by supplementing the kidney and treating the liver with Kidney Qi Pills. If the heart rides on the liver along with other symptoms, refer to the &#39;Essentials&#39; for more details. The term &#39;ride&#39; is like riding in a vehicle. The interactions among the five organs are unpredictable; for instance, liver disease must first treat the lungs and supplement the kidneys, and then examine the liver for deficiencies or excesses to adjust accordingly. The other organs follow this principle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heart shock is hard to express, leading to a desire to lie down.&quot;<br>&quot;Notes: Heart shock causes twitching. Frustration and heat rise, leading to a strong tongue wishing to speak but unable to, causing crying. Chest heat results in a desire to lie down to cool off. Suitable remedies include Heart-Drain Decoction, Guide Red Powder, and Small Fresh Rhinoceros Powder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In deficiency, it leads to fatigue and increased anxiety.&quot;<br>&quot;Notes: Use Warm Shock Pill as the main remedy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Spleen fatigue leads to body heat, thirst, and loss of appetite.&quot;<br>&quot;Notes: Spleen fatigue refers to exhaustion. When excessive, it causes fatigue and sleep without opening the eyes, body heat, thirst for water, and possible yellow or red urine either in retention or leakage. The remedy should be Yellow Drain Powder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In deficiency, it causes vomiting and diarrhea, yielding phlegm from wind.&quot;<br>&quot;Notes: In deficiency, there is regurgitation of a foul taste, diarrhea that is white, excessive sleeping with eyes open, and gradual onset of wind in the limbs and possibly phlegm; suitable remedies include Qian&#39;s White Atractylodes Powder, Different Effects Powder, and Regulating Middle Pill. If the liver acts on the spleen, leading to wind and vomiting, add Huangqin to Erchen Decoction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lungs dry, leading to a dry nose and pinching in the eyes.&quot;<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>**Notes: If the lungs are dry, it leads to wheezing and coughing; one should consider the symptoms of wheezing with a strong breath or thirst and use the Xie Bai San to moisten. If there is pressure in the chest due to lung cold without fullness, but a combination of heat and wind cold causing chest fullness, shortness of breath, and coughing, use Xie Bai San or Da Qing Gao.</p>
<p>If there is deficiency, there will be slight breathlessness without satisfaction. </p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> If there is deficiency, the lips will appear pale, and the breath may be obstructed, leading to long, shallow breathing; first take Yi Huang San, then Er Jiao San. </p>
<p>If the kidneys are cold, there is a fear of bright light.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> If the kidneys are insufficient, children with kidney deficiency are often hard to nurture and may have a high risk of early death; those who become deficient due to illness can be replenished. </p>
<p>If there is downward sinking accompanied by heat in the feet desiring to ascend.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> If sinking occurs, the bones feel heavy, leading to a desire to bend down. Hot feet dislike coverings, and heart fire descends to the kidneys, so root a Kidney Qi Pill or Zheng Qi Decoction. Moreover, if lung disease is heavy and follows with liver deficiency, it is easier to treat; if with liver heat, it is harder to treat. This is because prolonged lung disease leads to cold deficiency, while strong liver energy can dominate. </p>
<p>The classics say: to be controlled and yet unable to control is called true strength. Thus, the method should be to nourish the spleen and lungs first, then drain the liver. When the lungs are dominant, it is necessary to nourish the liver and drain the lungs. However, in cases of chronic cough and deficiency, Xie Bai San should not be taken; the Kidney Qi Pill is more appropriate. </p>
<p>The diseases of the five organs do not escape the principles of the five elements of generation and overcoming, leading to imbalances of deficiency and excess in the organs. The common perception does not analyze these principles, often hastily attributing them to external pathogens or internal injuries, leading to ineffective treatments and unnecessary deaths. The contributions of Qian and Jie Gu are indeed substantial!**<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br><strong>The Song of the Five Organs</strong><br><strong>By Qiao Yue, Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heart</strong>  </p>
<p>Diarrhea turns to dysentery, black blood makes one difficult to endure thirst.<br>The heart governs blood; when the heart is exhausted, blood color turns black, leading to emptiness and dryness causing thirst.<br>Muscles weaken, making it hard to walk or sit, and the tongue becomes feeble, unable to retract or hide.<br>The heart governs the tongue; when it is exhausted, it cannot retract.<br>The face is red like grease;<br>When dysentery persists, the face should lack color, yet now the complexion is like grease: the heart&#39;s exhaustion leads to yang deficiency causing outbreaks.<br>No speech, the mouth develops sores.<br>The heart governs the tongue; when exhausted, speech is impossible.<br>If one suffers this in midsummer, further contemplation is unwise.  </p>
<p><strong>Liver</strong>  </p>
<p>The eyes weep constantly, the whole body feels like a drunken person.<br>Repeatedly craving sleep, the heart is troubled and irritable.<br>When the liver is exhausted, vision cannot be clear, hence constant weeping and a desire to sleep.<br>Additionally, the liver governs the tendons; when weakened, one feels like a drunk, unable to lift oneself.<br>Also, the liver governs anger; when exhausted, one experiences continuous irritability and rage.<br>Pale lips, swollen eyes, frantic and loud cries.<br>In the east, there are signs of this condition; illness is unfit for spring.  </p>
<p><strong>Spleen</strong>  </p>
<p>The complexion is yellow at times, but must not be relayed to others.<br>The body is weak, highly intolerant of cold, and worms seek food and sustenance.<br>The spleen governs the limbs; when it is exhausted, the body weakens.<br>Moreover, when the spleen is exhausted, the kidney&#39;s energy rises against it, resulting in a dislike of cold.<br>Absence of appetite leads to heat in the stomach, causing worms to unrest and regurgitate.<br>Eating is feeble; lips lack strength, and exposed teeth are difficult to cover at times.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>The spleen governs the lips; if it fails, one cannot close them over the teeth, nor can one suckle. The eyes are directed downwards; the eye sockets belong to the spleen; if they fail, they sink. One cannot remain in the human world.</p>
<p>The lungs correspond with the color white; do not let them show signs of failure. If the nose turns bluish and the eye sockets are dark and dry, the abdomen is distended. The lungs govern the nose; if they fail, the liver will reverse and cause a bluish color. Furthermore, if the lungs fail, there will be no mucus, hence the dark and dry nostrils. The lungs also govern the eyelids; if they fail, they will sink. A straight neck with rapid breathing indicates that the lungs govern breath; if they fail, breathing becomes urgent and the neck straightens in an attempt to draw in air. When breath is exhausted, the chest will feel full and distended, producing outgoing breath without a return. In autumn, encountering this condition, one’s four directions will be estranged.</p>
<p>In the kidneys, there is cold sweat at all times, frequent night urination, causing shock. When the kidneys fail, yin and yang become separated, hence the cold sweat appears and urination cannot be controlled. Essence is where the spirit resides; if it fails, the spirit departs, causing frequent shock at night. The kidneys are associated with yin, and night also belongs to yin. The whole body breaks out in grain-like sores; the hands and feet feel as cold as ice. This is because yang cannot warm the body. The head tilts and is difficult to lift; the face is dark and lacks spirit. When the kidneys fail, the heavenly pillar and bones collapse, the face becomes dark and devoid of spirit. This condition corresponds with the elements of ren and gui; in winter, one may perish.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　五脏证治总论</p>
<p>　　是病皆从五脏生，不知脏腑亦徒然。细将色脉相参合，对证裁方治不难。　　五脏平和，则病不生。或寒暑之违和，或饮食之失节，则风伤肝、暑伤心、寒伤肺、湿伤肾、饮食伤脾而病生矣。语其色则肝青、心赤、脾黄、肺白、肾黑也。语其脉，则肝弦、心洪、脾缓、肺毛、肾沉也。语其证，则肝主风、心主惊、脾主困、肺主喘、肾主虚也。语其治，则心肺脾三脏有补有泻，肝则有泻无补，肾则有补无泻也。色脉证治，本诸五脏，心中了了，谓之上工。　　五脏之中肝有余，脾常不足肾常虚。心热为火同肝论，娇肺遭伤不易愈。　　人皆曰肝常有余，脾常不足。予亦曰心常有余，肺常不足。有余为实，不足为虚。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>《内经》曰：邪气盛则实，真气夺则虚。此所谓有余不足者，非经云虚实之谓也。盖肝之有余者，肝属木，旺于春，春乃少阳之气，万物之所资以发生者也。儿之初生曰芽儿者，谓如草木之芽，受气初生，其气方盛，亦少阳之气方长而未已，故曰肝有余。有余者，乃阳自然有余也。脾常不足者，脾司土气，儿之初生，所饮食者乳耳，水谷未入，脾未用事，其气尚弱，故曰不足。不足者，乃谷气之自然不足也。心亦曰有余者，心属火，旺于夏，所谓壮火之气也。肾主虚者，此父母有生之后，禀气不足之谓也。肺亦不足者，肺为娇脏，难调而易伤也。脾肺皆属太阴，天地之寒热伤人也，感则肺先受之；水谷之寒热伤人也，盛则脾先受之。故曰脾肺皆不足。　　肝为风木主生风，形证昭然在目中。<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>虽然泻之无用补，少阳生气与春同。　　肝者，足厥阴风木也，木生风，故主风。钱氏云：肝主风，实则目直视大叫，呵欠烦闷项急；虚则咬牙多欠，气热则外生，气湿则内生。此肝病之证也。肝之窍在目，故有病常以目候之。如肝有风则目连札，肝有热则目直视，肝疳则白膜遮睛之类是也。又肝主筋，肝病则筋急，为项强，为搐搦牵引。肝主怒，病则性急大叫哭，甚则卵肿，俗呼气卵是也。肝在下焦，热则大小便难。肝藏魂，肝热手寻衣领，胡乱捻物，甚则提空摸床，此丧魂之病也。　　肝病钱氏有泻青丸一方而无补者，谓其气有余也。然肝乃少阳之气，所以养生者也。肝无病，固不可泻以伐生气，亦不可补以助长也。　　肝胆原来从火治，木中有火无人识。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>水不能胜号龙雷，惟有甘温差可制。　　肝胆之病从火治者，木中原有火。《燧人氏传》云：知空有火，丽木则明。此其验也。肝胆之火，水不能灭，寒不能胜，又谓龙雷之火。惟甘温之剂，如人参、甘草之类，可以制之也。故曰：甘能泻火也。《内经》曰：辛以散之。如川芎、防风之类。又曰：辛甘发散为阳。以辛甘之药合而用之，所谓火郁则发之。此治肝病之大略也。　　肝热以泻青丸、当归芦荟丸泻之。肝实同法。肝虚以六味地黄丸补之。肝乃肾之子，虚则补其母也。肝寒以温胆汤及吴茱萸、生姜之类。　　儿病，目视物不转睛，或斜规不转，或目合不开，或目开不合，或哭无泪，或不哭泪自出者，皆肝绝也。　　心为神舍易生惊，色脉相通恶热侵。实则避嫌惟泻腑。如虚丛脞要安神。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>　　《内经》曰：心者君主之官，神明出焉。儿之初生，知觉未开，见闻易动，故神怯而易生惊也。钱氏云：心主惊。实则叫哭发热，饮水而搐；虚则困卧悸动不安。此心病之证也。心主血脉，色者血之萃，脉者心之合也。如色见红润，脉来大数者，此心气有余之象，其儿易养。如色见昏黯，脉来沉细者，此为不足，其儿多病难养。此观其形色脉以知其心中之虚实也。心恶热，与风相搏则发搐，故肝生风，得心热则搐也。心属火，火盛则津液干而病渴。心藏神，热则神乱而卧不安。喜合面睡卧者，心气热则胸中亦热，欲言不能，而有就冷之意，故合面卧。心气实则气上下行濇，合面则气不通，故喜仰卧。有努其身而直伸者，谓之上窜，亦心热也。舌者心之苗。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>热则舌破成疮，又为重舌木舌，舌长出不收之病。《内经》曰：诸痛痒疮疡，皆属于心火。儿病瘤丹斑疹蛇缠虎带虫疥熛疮，皆心火之病也。　　钱氏治心热病以导赤散，夫导赤乃泻小肠之药也。心为君主，不可犯之，泻其腑者，以避嫌也。心虚则主不安，故以安神丸补其脏也。　　心为君主岂容邪，客热来侵事可嗟。泻实补虚有成法，何须方外觅灵砂。　　心为火脏，常苦缓散而不收。孙真人立生脉散，夏月服之，以五味子之酸，能收耗散之气也。治儿心病者，扩而充之可也。故心热病坐于内者，宜导赤散、泻心汤、东垣安神丸之类；生于外者，如口舌生疮，洗心散主之。心气虚者，钱氏安神丸；虚易惊者，琥珀抱龙丸。《内经》曰：以苦泻之，黄连是也；以咸补之，泽泻车前子是也。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>神气浮越多惊悸者，宜朱砂赤石脂龙骨以镇之。如心病久，汗出发润，或舌出不收，或暴哑不语，或神昏愦乱，或斑疹变黑，此皆心绝之候，不治。　　幼科方中脾病多，只因乳食致沉疴。失饥失饱皆成疾，寒热交侵气不和。　　《内经》曰：脾胃者，仓廪之官。谓为水谷之所聚也。儿之初生，脾薄而弱，乳食易伤，故曰脾常不足也。钱氏云：脾主困，实则困睡，身热饮水；虚则吐泻生风。此脾病之证也。脾属土，其体静，故脾病喜困。土主湿。湿伤则为肿、为胀、为黄、为吐泻不止，则成慢惊风。《内经》曰：土气之下，木气承之。土为坤土、坤为腹，故脾病则腹中痛，脾疳则肚大筋青也。脾之窍在口唇，脾有风则口喎唇动，热则口臭唇疮，寒则口角流涎，谓之滞颐。气不和则口频撮。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>脾主舌本，热则吐舌弄舌。脾主肉，脾虚则瘦，大肉折。脾主味，脾虚则不喜食，脾热则食不作肌肤，伤于食则成积，积久则成癖。脾主津液，脾热则口干饮水。虚则津腋不生而成疳也。　　脾与胃异同论，盖胃受谷，脾消谷也。调其脾胃者，当适其寒温，节其饮食也。故饱则伤胃，饥则伤脾；热则伤胃，寒则伤脾。　　胃爱清凉脾爱温，难将脾胃一般论。阴阳相济和为贵，偏热偏寒不可凭。　　脾喜温而恶寒，胃喜清凉而恶热，喜恶不同，故难拘一法也。盖脾胃属土，居中以应四傍。其立法也，必四气俱备五味调和而后可。四气者，谓寒热温凉也。五味者，谓酸苦甘辛咸也。辛甘温热为阳，酸苦咸寒为阴。气味合而服之，谓之阴阳相济，得其中和之法也。如偏热则伤胃，偏寒则伤脾，非中道也。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>钱氏立方，以益黄散补脾。东垣老人谓其偏热，而以异功散代之，其虑深矣。祖训：钱氏诸方法当遵守，惟脾胃一条，吾于脾热者泻黄散，胃热者人参白虎汤，脾胃寒者理中汤丸，脾胃虚者异功散、调元汤、人参白朮散、养脾丸，伤食者消积丸、保和丸，宿食成积者枳朴大黄丸，湿胜者胃苓丸，欲成疳者肥儿丸，已成疳者集圣丸。此吾家秘之法也，不可轻泄。　　如脾病久，大肉消削，肚大青筋，或口噤不开，或唇口开张，或遍身虚肿，或脚背肿，眼下胞肿，或吐泻不止，饮食不入，或睡则露睛，口开不合，或多食而瘦，口馋，喜啖甜物，或虫出于口，或唇搴而缩，此皆脾绝之证也，不可治。　　肺为娇脏原主气，寒热蒸侵其气逆。<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>热壅胸高喘不宁，虚羸气短难报息。　　肺最居上，为脏腑之华盖。口鼻相通，息之出入，气之升降，必由之路，故主气。钱氏云：肺主喘，实则闷乱喘促，有饮水者，有不饮水者；虚则哽气长出气。此肺病之证也。《难经》曰：形寒则伤肺。儿之衣太薄则伤寒。《内经》曰：热伤肺。儿衣太厚则伤热。寒热伤肺则气逆，为喘为咳。鼻者肺之窍，肺受风，则喷嚏，鼻流清涕；受寒则鼻塞，呼吸不利；受热则鼻干，或为衄血；肺疳则鼻下赤烂。肺主皮毛，肺虚则皮干毛焦。病喘咳者，喘不止则面肿，咳不止则胸骨高，谓之龟胸。交惊者，死证也。肺属金，其体燥，病则渴不止，好饮水，谓之膈消。　　真膈肺气与天通，药用清汤以类从。肺实麻黄强泻白，阿胶虚补有奇功。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>　　《内经》曰：天气通于肺，轻清为天，清阳出上窍，本乎天者亲上也。故治肺病者，宜用辛甘升浮之药。如苦酸必用酒炒，使上升也。钱氏立方，肺实者以泻白散、葶苈丸，虚者以阿胶散。袓训云：其法太简。肺主喘咳，因于寒者，麻黄汤为主；因于热者，以泻白散；肺热在胸者，以东垣凉膈散；渴饮水者，人参白虎汤；咽喉痛者，甘桔牛蒡子汤；欬有痰者，玉液丸；肺虚甚者，调元汤。肺乃脾之子，虚则补其母也。或单以生脉散。其法始备。　　如肺久病，咳嗽连绵，喘息不休，或肩息，或龟胸，或咳血不止，或咳而惊，或鼻干黑燥，或鼻孔张开而喘，或泻利不休，大吼如筒，或面目虚浮，上喘气逆。此皆肺绝之候，不治。　　天一真精聚命门，人无天脉木无根。<a id="orig-20p" href="#trans-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>内行骨髓宜坚固，一水难胜二火焚。　　肾属水，乃天一真精之所生也。人之有肾，由木之有根。其脉在尺，肾之虚实，以尺脉候之。命门在肾之间，为元气聚会之虔。儿之强弱寿夭，尤系于斯。全主实无虚也。肾气不足则下窜，盖骨重惟欲下坠而缩身。肾水阴也，肾虚则目畏明，儿本虚怯，由胎气不成则神不足，目中白睛多，其颅即解，色晃白，此皆难养。或有因病而致，非肾虚也，此属病之证也。肾主骨，肾虚者，骨髓不满也。儿必畏寒，多为五软之病。尻骨不成，则不能坐；膑骨不成，则不能行。齿乃骨之余，骨不余，则齿生迟。肾之液为血，发乃血之余，肾虚则发希不黑。肾之窍在耳，肾虚则耳薄，热则其中出脓。肾主齿，热则生疳，即走马疳也。　　肾开窍于二阴，肾热则大小便不通，肾冷则小便下如米泔。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>二火者，乃君相火也。经曰：一水不胜二火。正此谓也。阴常不足肾常虚，筋骨难成貌必癯。钱氏立方惟有补，经云疮疹泻其余。　　水为阴，火为阳，一水不胜二火，此阳常有余，阴常不足，肾之本虚也明矣。故钱氏只用补肾地黄丸一方。不敢泻者，因无实证也。或谓痘疹，肾不可实，当泻之。此言甚谬。盖肾主液，痘中之血化为水，水化为脓，皆肾之津液所化也。若无肾水，则疮枯黑而死矣。岂可泻之？痘疹曰归肾者，盖疮疹之毒，内发于骨髓，外发于皮毛者为顺；变黑复陷入于骨髓之中，故为害。此非顺之为害也，乃火旺水衰之病。钱氏以百祥丸、牛李膏治黑陷者，以泻肾中之邪，非肾中之真阴也。详见《痘疹心要》。肾热大便不通者，宜以猪胆汁导之。<a id="orig-22p" href="#trans-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>猪者，水畜也。小便不利者，宜五苓散，泻其膀胱腑也。东垣滋阴丸以泻肾火。如肾病久，身下窜，目中如见鬼状，或骨痿弱，卧不能起，或二便遗失，皆肾绝之候，不治。　　本脏自病论精神，补泻分明有定方。若是相传作兼病，更宜通变互提纲。　　按《难经》有五邪之论，论本脏自病者为正，邪自前来者为实，邪自后来者为虚，邪自所胜来者为微邪，自所不胜来者为贼邪。此以五行生克之理论也。钱氏所论肝主风、心主惊、脾主困、肺主喘、肾主虚，此皆本脏自病者，谓之正邪，故立五补六泻之方以主之。洁古先生乃取《难经》之言，以明五脏传变之证，补钱氏之所未及者，其法始备。故风伤肝，热伤心，湿伤肺，寒伤肾，饮食劳倦则伤脾，此五脏自受之邪，为本病也。<a

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>[Note: If there are signs of excess heat in the heart and small intestine, treat with previous medicines. If there is deficiency in the heart and spleen blood, use Wumei Yigong San combined with Angelica. If due to insufficient heart blood, use Mi Zhi An Shen Wan. For dryness of liver and heart blood, use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San. If there is deficiency of liver and heart blood, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If due to spleen deficiency causing food stagnation and phlegm leading to fright and unrest, use Si Jun Zi to strengthen the spleen, Shen Qu and Mai Ya to aid digestion, and Shan Zhi and Chai Hu to clear heat. If the above formulas are used and the illness persists, promptly adjust to replenish the vital energy; or if symptoms worsen, urgently warm and replenish the vital energy. This often results from pregnancy with rich flavors and emotional fluctuations, or from improper breastfeeding in infants, or from the nursing mother&#39;s diet and emotional disturbances. Once the illness manifests and vital energy is deficient, one must trace the causes and primarily support the stomach to strengthen energy, complemented by medicines to treat the disease. I will follow this approach.]</p>
<p>The liver governs wind; if there is excess, the face will turn green, eyes will be straight, and there will be loud crying and strong heat with neck tightness and restlessness; if there is deficiency, there will be teeth grinding and yawning. </p>
<p>When there is heat in the liver, the hands grasp at clothing and fidget with objects; use Xie Qing Wan for this. For intense heat, drinking water causes wheezing; use Xie Bai San for this.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is wind-heat in the liver channel with symptoms like straightening of the eyes, use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San to clear liver fire, and add Wei Si Wu Tang to nourish liver blood. If there is kidney deficiency with symptoms like teeth grinding, use Liu Jun Zi Tang to strengthen the spleen, and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water. If one does not carefully examine the signs of deficiency or excess and improperly uses the above medications, the dangers of deficiency will be unavoidable. Be cautious!</p>
<p>If there is wind in the liver, the eyes are linked with disturbance; if there is heart heat, it leads to convulsions, or the tendons and veins are pulled leading to direct vision. Use Xie Qing Wan to treat the liver and Dao Chi San to clear the heart.</p>
<p>If there is liver heat, the eyes are red, and if accompanied by convulsions, also use the above two medications. If the wind is severe, the body becomes stiff and tense; use Di Huang Wan to tonify the kidneys and Xie Qing Wan to treat the liver.</p>
<p>Note: For the previous symptoms, if there is excess heat in the liver channel, Xie Qing Wan is appropriate. If the blood in the liver channel is dry and causes diseases, then Yi Gan San should be used. If kidney water is insufficient to nourish the liver, then Di Huang Wan is suitable. If the spleen soil is weak and cannot strengthen the wood, Liu Jun Zi Tang should be employed. </p>
<p>In cases where the liver channel is already affected, the clash of wind and fire leads to damage to the spleen. If the fundamental is not secured, other symptoms will inevitably emerge.</p>
<p>The spleen governs worries; if there is excess, the body heat leads to thirst, use Xie Huang San; if deficient, vomiting and diarrhea lead to wind, use Yi Gong San.</p>
<p>Facial pallor, abdominal pain, cold qi in the mouth, loss of appetite, or vomiting clear water—use Yi Huang San for warming and supplementation. For spleen deficiency with diarrhea, use Tiao Zhong Wan. </p>

If there is fever with dry mouth, aversion to cold food and drink, or diarrhea with white color, and the person sleeps with their eyes closed, this indicates a condition of both cold and deficiency in the body, and it is appropriate to use the Yi Gong San to adjust and tonify it. If the spleen qi is sinking, the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang should be used for elevation and tonification. If cold water insults the earth element, the Yi Huang San should be applied for warming and supplementation. If the liver wood overcomes the earth element, the Liu Jun Cha Hu Ping Bu should be used for balancing and tonifying. If there are slight eye movements, tidal heat, convulsions, vomiting, and diarrhea with loss of appetite, it is recommended to use the Mi Zhi Bao Pi Tang. For pediatric ailments, one should first regulate and tonify the spleen and stomach to solidify the foundation, leading to the resolution of all diseases.</p>
<p>The lungs govern喘 (asthma), and if there is fullness, it leads to obstruction, turmoil, and rapid breathing with difficulty when drinking water; if there is deficiency, it results in a choking sensation and difficulty exhaling. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Treatment of Organ Interactions</strong></p>
<p>When liver disease appears in autumn, the liver is strong and overtakes the lungs, causing lung weakness. It is advisable to use Ejiao San to nourish the lungs, Yiyuang San to strengthen the spleen, and Xieqing Wan to treat the liver. </p>
<p>[Note: According to Mr. Jie Gu Zhang, when the liver overpowers the lungs, the body feels hot, leading to spasms, shortness of breath, and symptoms appearing during the periods of Shen, You, and Xu. This is described as true strength, unable to conquer due to external constraints. If the heart takes control of the liver as a real pathogenic factor, there is strong heat and significant spasms. For this situation, Li Jing and Liang Jing Wan can be administered. When the lungs take control of the liver as a thief&#39;s evil, the patient experiences yawning and weak spasms. For this, Di Huang Wan is used to nourish the liver, while Xie Bai San is employed to treat the lungs. </p>
<p>When the liver overcomes the spleen as a thief&#39;s evil, the patient feels sleepy, heavy in body, and experiences spasms, with Xieqing Wan being the treatment of choice. If the kidneys overcome the liver as a vacuous evil, the patient experiences a dislike of cold, yawning, and spasms; in this case, Qiang Huo Gao is indicated. Generally, in cases of liver disease, one must first examine the condition of the lungs and kidneys. The kidneys are the mother of the liver, and metal is the thief of wood; without kidney water, they cannot nourish each other, leading to the lung metal&#39;s spirit evil attacking. Therefore, when the source is in the lungs, one must first treat the lungs to dispel the spirit evil; if the source is in the kidneys, one should first nourish the kidneys to support their foundation. Then, one should assess the vacuity or repletion of the root organ and determine whether warming or cooling treatments are necessary. This approach aligns with the views of Liang Baoren as well.**<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heart disease in winter manifests when the heart is stronger than the kidneys. In severe cases, there may be a descent causing lack of speech. One should use the Di Huang Wan to tonify the kidneys and Dao Chi San to treat the heart.</p>
<p>Note: According to Jie Gu, if there is wheezing with strong heat, this indicates the lungs invading the heart, which is a slight evil, treated with Xie Bai San. If there is a clash of wind and heat, this indicates the liver invading the heart, representing a deficiency evil, treated with Da Qiang Huo Tang and Da Qing Wan. If there is vomiting and diarrhea with body heat, this indicates the spleen invading the heart, representing a solid evil, treated with Xie Huang San. If there is fear accompanied by chills, this indicates the kidneys invading the heart, representing a thief evil, treated with An Shen Wan. </p>
<p>Generally, when there is heart disease, one must first regulate the liver. The kidneys are the spirit of the heart. When the liver’s qi is smooth, the heart’s qi is harmonious; when the liver’s qi is weak, the heart’s qi is deficient. Thus, for heart ailments, first address the liver to clear the source. When the five organs are ill, it must be transmitted to those they conquer; therefore, when the kidneys are afflicted, it will inevitably affect the heart. Hence, first treat the kidneys to expel the evil. If the liver and kidneys are balanced and there is still heart illness, then one should examine the deficiency and fullness for treatment.</p>
<p>Lung disease manifests in spring when the lungs are stronger than the liver, treated with Xie Bai San for the lungs. If the eyes are pale blue or red, there may be convulsions, indicating liver deficiency, treated with Di Huang Wan to tonify the liver.</p>
<p>Note: According to Jie Gu, if lung disease presents with wheezing and strong qi, appearing at the times of Yin, Mao, and Chen, one should tonify the liver and drain the lungs. If lung disease persists with cough, it is advisable to tonify the spleen and clear the heart. If the heart invades the lungs, representing a thief evil, with heat and wheezing, use Di Huang Wan, Dao Chi San, and E Jiao San.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What does this mean? The lungs govern qi; if there is heat in the lungs, it generates heat and upward steam, preventing it from nourishing the kidneys, thus causing evil to affect the kidneys. Hence, the source of kidney disease lies in the lungs. Furthermore, dampness from the spleen channel can harm the kidneys; therefore, it is necessary to clear lung heat and remove spleen dampness. If the disease arises from this channel itself, it should be nourished and supplemented.</p>
<p>Spleen diseases manifest nearby; they should be treated similarly. Those that present normally are easy to treat, while those that present abnormally are difficult to treat. If the spleen is deficient, the complexion will appear yellow. The five organs interact; treatment should follow the symptoms.</p>
<p>Note: According to ancient texts, when diseases of the spleen arise, one must first examine the deficiency or excess of the liver and heart and treat accordingly. The liver is the spleen&#39;s thief, while the heart is the spleen&#39;s mother. If liver qi is strong, it hinders the spleen; if heart qi is deficient, the spleen becomes weak. Thus, when the liver overacts on the spleen, it leads to wind-dampness causing vomiting; in such cases, the method of administering Fu Ling and Ban Xia decoction is appropriate. If heart qi is robust and there is strong heat, leading to heaviness and diarrhea, one should resort to Qiang Huo, Huáng Qín, Cāng Zhú, and Gān Cǎo decoction. If the lungs overact on the spleen causing coughing and constipation while diet is normal, then Chefing and Dà Huáng decoction should be administered, along with the use of Téng Li Wán. If the kidneys overact on the spleen resulting in aversion to cold and diarrhea, methods like the Rì Zhōng Wán should be used.</p>
<p>I humbly believe that the symptoms of the five organs interact in ways that are concealed and unpredictable, yet the mechanism of disease does not stray from the principles of the five elements of generation, overcoming, and transformation. Furthermore, since children do not have the seven emotions fully developed, their ailments often arise from weak and frail constitutions and incomplete blood and qi, leading to diseases where the five organs overpower each other. Therefore, one should prioritize treating the mother (root cause) rather than focusing solely on the child (symptoms), as this often leads to mistakes.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret of Infant Care</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on the Diagnosis and Treatment of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>All diseases arise from the five organs; if one does not understand the organs and bowels, it is futile. By carefully combining color and pulse for diagnosis, it is not difficult to adapt prescriptions and treat ailments. When the five organs are in harmony, no disease arises. Whether it be due to imbalances from cold and heat or disruptions in diet, maladies arise: wind injures the liver, heat affects the heart, cold harms the lungs, dampness injures the kidneys, and dietary issues damage the spleen. Correspondingly, the colors are as follows: the liver is green, the heart red, the spleen yellow, the lungs white, and the kidneys black. For the pulses: the liver is string-like, the heart is surging, the spleen is slow, the lung is fine, and the kidneys are deep. In terms of symptoms, the liver governs wind, the heart is associated with fright, the spleen deals with fatigue, the lungs are linked to wheezing, and the kidneys signify deficiency. Regarding treatment: the heart, lungs, and spleen may have both tonifying and reducing methods, while the liver solely has reducing techniques, and the kidneys have only tonification without reduction. The assessment of color, pulse, symptoms, and treatment is fundamentally based on the five organs; understanding this deeply is termed superior skill. Among the five organs, the liver is often excessive, the spleen commonly insufficient, and the kidneys frequently deficient. The heart&#39;s heat equates it with fire, akin to the liver, while the delicate lungs, once injured, do not easily recover. People often say the liver is easily excessive and the spleen often deficient; I also say the heart is often excessive and the lungs often deficient. Excess indicates fullness, while deficiency indicates emptiness.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; says: When pathogenic Qi is strong, there is fullness; when the true Qi is depleted, there is emptiness. This refers to what is in excess and what is insufficient, not merely the distinction between fullness and emptiness as stated in the classics. The liver, when in excess, belongs to wood, thriving in spring, which is the season of the lesser yang energy, the source for all things to flourish. The newborn is called a sprout because it is like the buds of grass and trees, which are initially nourished by the vital energy and are at their most vigorous stage; hence, it is said that the liver is in excess. Excess indicates a natural surplus of yang.</p>
<p>The spleen is often deficient because it governs the energy of earth. In infancy, the only nourishment is breast milk; since solid food has not yet been ingested, the spleen has not yet been engaged in its function, and thus its energy remains weak. Therefore, it is said to be insufficient. Insufficiency indicates a natural deficiency of dietary energy.</p>
<p>The heart is also described as having an excess; it belongs to fire and thrives in summer, which is the manifestation of vigorous fire energy. The kidney, however, signifies deficiency, as it refers to the lack of vital essence inherited from the parents after birth. The lungs too are often deficient; they are delicate organs, difficult to regulate and easily injured. Both the spleen and the lungs belong to the greater yin, and can be harmed by the extremes of cold and heat in nature; should one be affected, the lungs are the first to suffer; similarly, the cold and heat in food can harm the spleen first when in excess. Thus, it is said that both the spleen and the lungs are deficient.</p>
<p>The liver is associated with wind and wood, governing the generation of wind, with manifest symptoms clearly observable in the eyes.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although purging is of no use to tonify, the energy of the lesser yang is akin to spring. </p>
<p>The liver, associated with the foot Jueyin and the wood element, generates wind, and thus it governs wind. According to the Qian family, the liver governs wind; in fact, it manifests through the eyes with straight gazes, loud calls, yawning, irritability, and a tight neck. If deficient, there may be teeth grinding and excessive yawning; if heat is present, symptoms manifest externally, while damp qi arises internally. These are indications of liver disease. The liver’s orifice is the eyes, so when ill, one often observes symptoms through the eyes. If there is wind in the liver, the eyes may twitch; if there is heat, the gaze may be direct; if there is liver disease, conditions such as a white membrane covering the eyes may occur. Furthermore, the liver governs the tendons, and if diseased, the tendons may be tight, leading to a stiff neck and spasms. The liver governs anger; if afflicted, one may display a hasty temperament, loud cries, and severe cases may lead to testicular swelling, commonly referred to as &quot;qi lump.&quot; When the liver is in the lower jiao, heat can cause difficulty in urination and bowel movements. The liver houses the soul; if liver heat is present, one may search for clothing, fidget with objects, or in severe cases, grasp at empty space and touch the bed, indicating a loss of soul.</p>
<p>The Qian family notes a formula called &quot;Xieqing Pill&quot; for liver disease but does not suggest tonification, declaring that liver qi is excessive. However, the liver belongs to the lesser yang; thus, it is essential for nurturing life. A healthy liver should not be purged to diminish vital energy, nor should it be tonified to promote growth.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Water cannot overcome the fire of the dragon thunder; only sweet and warm differences can control it. Diseases of the liver and gallbladder treated by fire stem from the existence of fire within wood. The &quot;Records of the Fire Man&quot; states: knowing that there is fire in the void, when wood is pleasing, it becomes bright. This is its verification. The fire of the liver and gallbladder cannot be extinguished by water or subdued by cold; it is also called the fire of the dragon thunder. Only sweet and warm remedies, such as ginseng and licorice, can control it. Therefore, it is said that sweetness can drain fire. The &quot;Internal Classic&quot; states: pungent substances disperse it, such as Chuanxiong and Fangfeng. It also states: pungent and sweet disperse for the yang. Using pungent and sweet medicines together, the so-called fire stagnation can be released. This is the general principle for treating liver diseases.</p>
<p>For liver heat, one may drain it with Qingpian pills or Danggui and Aloe pills. For a firm liver, the same method applies. For liver deficiency, it is replenished with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. The liver is the child of the kidney; when deficient, one should nourish its mother. For liver cold, one uses the Wendan Decoction along with Wu Zhu Yu and ginger.</p>
<p>In children’s diseases, if they cannot focus their gaze, or if their eyes do not move or cannot close, or if they open their eyes but cannot close them, or if they cry without tears, or do not cry but tears flow, all indicate a severe liver condition.</p>
<p>The heart is the dwelling of the spirit, easily startled, with colors and pulses intertwined, suffering from the invasion of heat. In reality, one should avoid suspicion by draining the bowels. If there is deficiency and anxiety, one must calm the spirit.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: The heart is the official of the sovereign, from which spirit and clarity emerge. At birth, a child’s awareness is not yet developed; their perception is easily stirred, hence their spirit is timid and prone to fright. Qian&#39;s perspective indicates: the heart governs fright. In actuality, this manifests as crying and fever, or restlessness after drinking water. In deficiency, there is fatigue, palpitations, and unease—this indicates a heart ailment. The heart governs blood vessels; color reflects the essence of blood, while pulse indicates the heart&#39;s condition. If the complexion appears rosy and the pulse is strong and frequent, it signifies an excess of heart qi, making the child easier to nurture. Conversely, if the complexion appears dull and the pulse is weak and fine, it indicates deficiency, leading to illness and making the child difficult to care for. Observing the shape, color, and pulse reveals the heart&#39;s true state. The heart dislikes heat; when it contends with wind, it leads to convulsions, hence the liver produces wind, which, when heated by the heart, results in convulsions. The heart is associated with fire; when fire is intense, body fluids become depleted, causing thirst. The heart houses the spirit; in heat, the spirit becomes chaotic, leading to restlessness in sleep. If a child prefers to sleep with their face covered, it indicates that heart qi is hot and the chest feels warm, making it hard to speak yet desiring coldness, thus they cover their face when sleeping. When heart qi is abundant, it moves freely; covering the face can obstruct qi flow, hence the preference for sleeping on the back. If the body is stretched upwards, this is termed &quot;ascending,&quot; which also indicates heart heat. The tongue is the sprout of the heart.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When overheated, the tongue becomes ulcerated, leading to conditions such as heavy and wooden tongue, and an elongated tongue that does not retract. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all pains, itching, sores, and ulcers relate to heart heat. Conditions in children such as tumors, red spots, rashes, and skin ailments are all attributed to heart heat.</p>
<p>The Qian family treats heart heat diseases with Daohong San, which is a laxative for the small intestine. The heart is the sovereign and should not be disturbed; laxatives are used to avoid suspicion. If the heart is deficient, the ruler is uneasy, hence Anshen Wan is used to nourish it.</p>
<p>The heart is the organ of fire; it often suffers from dispersion without consolidation. Master Sun&#39;s Shengmai San is to be taken in summer; its sourness from Schisandra can consolidate the dissipated energy. For treating children&#39;s heart conditions, one can expand and fill the heart. Therefore, for internal heart heat diseases, remedies like Daohong San, Xuanshen Decoction, and Dongyuan Anshen Wan are appropriate; for external manifestations like sores in the mouth or tongue, Xixin San is indicated. For those with deficient heart Qi, Qian&#39;s Anshen Wan is recommended; for those who easily startle, Hupo Baolong Wan is suitable.

These all indicate a severed heart condition, which cannot be treated.</p>
<p>In pediatric prescriptions, many spleen diseases arise simply from excessive dairy and food intake, leading to persistent ailments. Whether from hunger or fullness, both can create illness, as cold and heat invade, disrupting the qi.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: the spleen and stomach are the officials of storage, where food and grains are gathered. At birth, the spleen is thin and weak, and can easily be harmed by food, hence it is said that the spleen is often insufficient. Qian says: the spleen governs heaviness; when it is full, there is tiredness and warmth followed by thirst; when it is deficient, it produces vomiting and diarrhea leading to wind. This indicates spleen disease.</p>
<p>The spleen belongs to earth, which is stable, hence spleen diseases favor heaviness. Earth governs dampness. When dampness damages, it leads to swelling, bloating, jaundice, and persistent vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in chronic convulsions. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: under the energy of earth, wood energy supports it. Earth represents the earth itself, and this relates to the abdomen; therefore, spleen diseases may manifest as abdominal pain, and spleen-related conditions result in a distended abdomen and blue veins.</p>
<p>The orifice of the spleen is the lips; if there is wind in the spleen, the mouth may twitch and the lips move; if there is heat, there may be bad breath and sores on the lips; if there is cold, drooling at the corners of the mouth occurs, known as stagnation of the lips.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The spleen governs the tongue; when there is heat, it causes the tongue to be thrust out and moved about. The spleen governs flesh; when the spleen is deficient, one becomes thin, and the flesh breaks down. The spleen governs taste; when the spleen is deficient, one lacks appetite, while excess heat in the spleen means that food does not produce muscle tissue. Injury from food may lead to accumulation, and prolonged accumulation can result in habitual disorders. The spleen governs body fluids; heat in the spleen causes dry mouth and a need for water. In deficiency, body fluids do not generate, leading to sores.</p>
<p>Regarding the differences and similarities between the spleen and stomach, it is said that the stomach receives grains, while the spleen transforms them. To regulate the spleen and stomach, one must adapt to their respective cold and warmth and manage their diet. Therefore, overeating damages the stomach, while hunger harms the spleen; heat injures the stomach, while cold affects the spleen.</p>
<p>The stomach prefers coolness, while the spleen enjoys warmth; thus, one cannot treat them the same. Yin and yang must harmonize for balance, and one must not rely solely on either extreme of heat or cold.</p>
<p>The spleen prefers warmth and dislikes cold, while the stomach enjoys coolness and shuns heat; their preferences differ, making it difficult to adhere to a single method. The spleen and stomach belong to the earth element, located centrally to respond to their surroundings. Hence, the principles must include the four seasonal qi and the harmony of the five tastes. The four qi are cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. The five tastes are sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salty. Pungent and sweet represent yang, while sour, bitter, and salty represent yin. When qi and taste combine, it is termed yin-yang harmonization, achieving balance. An excess of heat damages the stomach, while an excess of cold harms the spleen; this is not the middle path.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

The Elder Dongyuan stated that this method is too heating, and he replaced it with Yi Gong San, demonstrating deep consideration. The ancestral teaching emphasizes that the various methods of the Qian family should be followed. However, regarding the stomach and spleen, for spleen heat, use Xie Huang San; for stomach heat, use Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang; for cold in the spleen and stomach, use Li Zhong Tang Wan; for deficiency of the spleen and stomach, employ Yi Gong San, Tiao Yuan Tang, Ren Shen Bai Shu San, and Yang Pi Wan; for food stagnation, use Xiao Ji Wan and Bao He Wan; for lingering food accumulation, use Zhi Po Da Huang Wan; for dampness prevailing, use Wei Ling Wan; for evolving sores, use Fei Er Wan; and for already formed sores, use Ji Sheng Wan. This is a secret method of our family and should not be disclosed lightly.</p>
<p>If the disease of the spleen persists for a long time, there may be noticeable weight loss, swollen abdomen, visible blue veins, inability to open the mouth, or the mouth and lips may be excessively opened, or there could be generalized swelling, swelling of the tops of the feet, swelling under the eyes, or incessant vomiting and diarrhea with an inability to take in food. Sleep may be disturbed with the eyes remaining open and the mouth not closing, or there may be excessive eating with weight loss, a craving for sweets, or worms emerging from the mouth, or the lips may be pulled tight - all these signs indicate a severe state of the spleen and are untreatable.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Heat clogs the chest, causing high panting and unrest; weakness and shortness of breath make it hard to return to tranquility. The lungs are the most elevated, serving as the crown of the organs. The mouth and nose are interconnected, and the inhalation and exhalation of breath, as well as the rise and fall of energy, must pass through them, thus they govern breath. According to the Qian family, the lungs control panting, which indeed manifests as disordered and rapid breathing; some may drink water, while others may not; if deficient, there’s prolonged difficulty in exhaling. This is a symptom of lung disease. The Nanjing states: cold harms the lungs. If a child wears clothing that is too thin, it may lead to cold injury. The Neijing states: heat harms the lungs. If a child is overdressed, it may lead to heat injury. Cold and heat injury the lungs causes reversed qi, resulting in panting and coughing. The nose is the orifice of the lungs; if the lungs are affected by wind, sneezing and a runny nose occur; if affected by cold, it results in nasal congestion and difficult breathing; if affected by heat, it causes dryness of the nose, or even nosebleeds; lung sores lead to red and ulcerated nostrils. The lungs govern the skin and hair; if the lungs are deficient, the skin becomes dry and the hair scorched. In cases of persistent panting and coughing, if panting does not stop, the face becomes swollen; if coughing does not stop, the sternum becomes protruded, referred to as &quot;turtle chest.&quot; Sudden shock leads to a sign of death. The lungs belong to metal, and their essence is dry; in illness, there is unquenchable thirst and a preference for drinking water, known as &quot;diaphragmatic consumption.&quot; The true diaphragm and lung qi communicate with heaven; medicinal use of clear soup is analogous to this.

Therefore, for treating lung diseases, one should use pungent and sweet medicines that promote elevation and dispersion. If it&#39;s bitter and sour, it must be stir-fried with alcohol to encourage ascent. According to Qian&#39;s established prescriptions, for excess lung conditions, one should use Xie Bai San or Ting Li Wan; for deficiency, use Ejiao San. The ancestral teachings say the method is too simple. The lungs govern panting and coughing; if due to cold, use Ma Huang Tang; if due to heat, use Xie Bai San. If lung heat is in the chest, use Dong Yuan Liang Ge San; for thirst, use Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang; for sore throat, use Gan Ju Niu Bang Zi Tang; if there&#39;s a cough with phlegm, use Yu Ye Wan; if lung deficiency is severe, use Tiao Yuan Tang.

The kidneys belong to water, and they arise from the true essence of heaven. A person has kidneys just as a tree has roots. The pulse is checked at the wrist; the state of the kidneys can be observed through the wrist pulse. The life gate is situated between the kidneys, where the original qi gathers with sincerity. The strength or weakness, longevity or premature death of a child is especially connected to this. A complete mastery requires no deficiency.</p>
<p>If the kidney qi is insufficient, it will sink down, as the heavy bones desire to drop and retract the body. Kidney water is of the yin; if the kidneys are deficient, the eyes fear light. The child is fundamentally weak and timid, stemming from a failure of the prenatal qi which leads to insufficient spirit. The whites of the eyes are abundant, and the skull becomes relaxed; the complexion appears pale and white, all of which are difficult to nourish.

If the coccyx is undeveloped, they cannot sit; if the kneecaps are undeveloped, they cannot walk. Teeth are the surplus of bones; if bones are insufficient, teeth emerge slowly. The fluid of the kidneys is blood, and hair is the surplus of blood; if the kidneys are deficient, the hair is sparse and not black. The openings of the kidneys are in the ears; if the kidneys are deficient, the ears become thin, and heat may lead to the discharge of pus from within. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The second fire refers to the fire of the ruler and minister. The classic states: &quot;One water cannot withstand two fires.&quot; This is exactly the meaning. The yin is always insufficient, and the kidneys are often deficient; therefore, the tendons and bones cannot fully develop, leading to emaciation. The Qian clan&#39;s treatment mainly focuses on replenishment. The classic mentions that sores and rashes require purgation and the rest. Water represents yin, and fire represents yang; when one water cannot withstand two fires, it indicates excess yang and insufficient yin, clearly showing the deficiency at the root of the kidneys. Therefore, the Qian clan only uses the Replenishing Kidney Dihuang pill. They dare not purge, due to a lack of concrete evidence. Some claim that for rashes, the kidneys should not be nourished but instead purged. This statement is quite erroneous. The kidneys govern fluids; the blood transformed in rashes becomes water, and this water transforms into pus, all of which are derived from the kidney&#39;s fluids. If the kidney water is absent, the sores would dry up, turn black, and lead to death. How could one possibly purge? The sickness of rashes labeled as returning to the kidneys indicates that the poison of the sores and rashes arises from the marrow and manifests externally on the skin; when it turns black and sinks back into the marrow, it becomes harmful. This is not harm caused by the surface but a disease of excess fire and diminished water. The Qian clan treats blackened and sunken issues with Baixiang pills and Niuli paste to purge the evil within the kidneys, not the true yin of the kidneys. This is elaborated in &quot;Essentials of Rashes.&quot; For kidney heat and constipation, it is advisable to guide it with pig bile.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p>The discussion of the internal organs is based on the mental/spiritual aspect, distinguishing clear methods of supplementation and draining. If they are seen to share coexisting diseases, it is more appropriate to consider their interrelation and modify the approach accordingly. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Nanjing&quot;, there are discussions about five evils: The genuine condition involves the internal organs themselves, while the external pathologies that come from the front are considered real; those that come from behind are seen as empty; evils that arise from being overpowered are termed subtle evils, and those that do not hold power over are referred to as thieves. This aligns with the theory of the five elements of generation and overcoming. </p>
<p>Qian’s assessment states that the liver governs wind, the heart governs fright, the spleen governs obstruction, the lungs govern wheezing, and the kidneys govern emptiness. All of these pertain to primary internal diseases, termed genuine and evil, thus establishing methods of five supplements and six drains. Mr. Jiegu took the words of the Nanjing to elucidate the evidence of transformation in the five organs, supplementing aspects that Qian’s theory did not cover, ensuring a complete method. Hence, wind harms the liver, heat harms the heart, dampness harms the lungs, cold harms the kidneys, and exhaustion from food intake injures the spleen. These pertain to evils that afflict the five organs themselves, marking them as the primary illness.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The liver is responsible for wind, and the wind in this context refers to the primary illness, known as true and false pathogens. If the condition is due to injury from heat, the true pathogen is the heart invading the liver; if it arises from injury by dampness, the false pathogen is the kidney invading the liver; if it results from dietary strain and fatigue, the minor pathogen is the spleen overcoming the liver. The other organs resemble this pattern. For detailed understanding, refer to the &quot;Forty-Nine Difficulties.&quot;</p>
<p>In the discussion of treatment methods for the five organs, if the liver is directly affected, the treatment should focus solely on the liver, using Qing Wan for drainage. If the heart is invading the liver, the appropriate remedy is to use Dao Chi to drain the heart, which effectively addresses the root issue. If the kidney injures the liver, one should use Jiang Fu Si Ni Tang to strengthen the kidney deficiency, thereby nourishing its mother. If the lung transmits to the liver, the recommended approach is to use Xie Bai San to drain the lung and Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver, first nourishing and then draining. If the spleen burdens the liver, it is advisable to use Tiao Yuan Tang to benefit the spleen and regulate the liver. The same reasoning applies to the other organs.</p>
<p>For other methods, there is no need for rigid adherence; they can be understood and applied flexibly. These all address the initial onset of the illness. </p>
<p>Moreover, when one organ&#39;s illness affects another, it is termed a &quot;concurrent syndrome,&quot; and the treatment should consider the urgency of the primary and secondary conditions. The initially observed condition is termed the &quot;root&quot; and is treated as less urgent, while the subsequent condition is called the &quot;branch&quot; and is treated as more urgent.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is difficulty in urination or defecation, persistent vomiting or diarrhea, swollen throat and pain, inability to eat, or urgent pain in the heart and abdomen, even if these symptoms appear later, they should be treated first. Therefore, it is said that in emergencies, one treats the symptoms. If there are no urgent symptoms, one should treat the initial illness first, and then address subsequent ailments based on their manifestations, which is known as treating the root when the situation allows.</p>
<p>In general, a child’s spleen issues are often due to improper balancing of milk and food. Knowing that other organ problems require harmonizing the stomach is vital; otherwise, it can lead to malnutrition and suffering. The stomach governs the intake of grains, while the spleen is responsible for their digestion. Hunger can harm the stomach, and overfeeding can insult the spleen. Children often suffer from overeating. If a mother is robust and has abundant milk, seeking to prevent the child from crying can lead to excessive breastfeeding, which can damage the milk&#39;s properties. Conversely, if the mother is weak and thin, her milk will be scarce, and to soothe the child’s cries, she may resort to giving them grains, meats, pastries, and fruits, leading to overindulgence and harm from food.</p>
<p>Thus, children&#39;s ailments are mostly related to the stomach. The five organs rely on the stomach&#39;s qi for nourishment. The stomach represents a balance of vital energy, unlike the individual weaknesses of the five organs. If any of the organs are affected, whether through purging or tonifying, one must be cautious not to disturb the stomach&#39;s qi. If the stomach&#39;s qi is damaged, it may lead to inability to eat and weight loss, or good appetite with weight loss, resulting in malnutrition which cannot be treated. As the classic says: “Whole grains lead to prosperity; absence of grains leads to demise.&quot; This is indeed a critical insight in the medical field.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Five Zang Organs and Their Related Diseases</h3>
<p>These are diseases arising from the movement of qi within the five zang organs, indicating illnesses that originate internally. The liver governs wind; when abundant, it leads to straight vision, yawning, loud crying, and a feeling of tension and discomfort in the neck. When deficient, it causes teeth clenching and yawning. If qi is warm, it internally generates wind; if qi is hot, it generates external wind as well. Qi here refers to the breath in the mouth. In cases of excess, use Xieqing pills or Danggui Longhui pills to purge; in cases of deficiency, use Dihuang pills to tonify. </p>
<p>All wind-related symptoms, convulsions, and distortions are indicative of liver disease and should be treated with Xieqing pills. Diseases originating from the liver, such as dizziness due to wind, belong to the wood element of the liver. The &quot;Pulse Canon&quot; states: heat generates wind. If there is a concurrent heart condition, it can result in fever and convulsions. If there is wind in the liver, it can cause the eyes to twitch lightly; if there is also heat in the heart, it can lead to blockage. If there is heat in the liver, the eyes may see straight without twitching; if heat in the heart is present, twitching occurs. Use Xieqing pills to purge the liver and Daochi powder to purge the heart.</p>
<p>If there are also symptoms from the spleen, mild cases may result in drowsiness and lack of appetite; one should observe the state of the stool. If the stool is dry, use honey-based remedies to gently guide it out, being careful not to propose purgation, for fear it may lead to spleen deficiency and worsen the condition. If the stool is moist, use Hupo Baolong pills as the treatment.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

<p>When there are also kidney symptoms, with sudden hoarseness and loss of voice, along with stiff limbs, this should be treated for wind. In mild cases, the Dihuang Pill is used; in severe cases, it becomes a chronic condition that cannot be treated.</p>
<p>The heart governs shock; if it is real, there will be crying and fever, and a tendency to convulse after drinking water; if it is empty, there will be fatigue, insomnia, and restless palpitations. For real conditions, the Daohong Pian herbal decoction is prescribed; for empty conditions, the Er An Shen Pill is used.</p>
<p>Various manifestations of heat, shock, and agitation with frequent crying indicate a primary heart condition. The Daohong Powder with朱砂 (cinnabar) is suitable for treatment. In severe cases, the Liangjing San Huang Xie Xin Wan should be used.</p>

<p>The heart fire represents the sovereign fire, which ought to cultivate virtue and not be toxic; when it causes itchiness or sores, it is the result of the ming men fire. Any sores on children stem from fetal toxins.</p>
<p>The spleen governs dampness, resulting in true fatigue or sleepiness, and a warm body prompting the need for water; if this leads to vomiting or diarrhea, it generates wind. If dampness is excessive, it can be treated with Xie Huang San or San Huang Wan; if it&#39;s deficient, it&#39;s treated with Yi Huang San, Yi Gong San, Xiao Jian Zhong Tang, or Tiao Yuan Tang, and Fei Er Wan for nourishment.</p>
<p>Sleepiness without appetite, along with vomiting and diarrhea, are all root issues of the spleen. For heavy sleep and fever, Wei Ling Wan or Hu Po Bao Long Wan should be used.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When symptoms of the liver are present, initially caused by wind, with vomiting and diarrhea, accompanied by aversion to wind and fever, along with restlessness and anxiety, one should disperse these symptoms using the Xingsheng San. If vomiting and diarrhea occur first, followed by a transformation to slow and startled responses, it is untreatable.</p>
<p>When symptoms of the heart are present, such as fever and drowsiness, with frightful dreams, one should use the Dongyuan Anshen Wan to treat it. If there is thirst and a desire to drink water, one should use the Chen Sha Wuling San.</p>
<p>When symptoms of the lungs appear, with fever and drowsiness, and difficulty breathing accompanied by wheezing, one should use the Tingli Wan to address it.</p>
<p>When symptoms of the kidneys are evident, such as emaciation and weakness, with a propensity to lie down and an inability to rise, one should supplement both the spleen and kidneys. To replenish the kidneys, one should use the Dihuang Wan; to replenish the spleen, the Yangpi Wan should be used. If diarrhea persists and results in bloody pus, it is fatal. The kidneys are the source of vital energy; if they are deficient, the constitution will be insufficient. The spleen is responsible for the production of qi; if it is weak, this leads to a deficiency of fluids. Therefore, among children’s diseases of the five organs, the spleen and kidneys are most affected, followed by the liver and heart, with the lungs being the least affected.</p>
<p>The lungs govern wheezing; in cases of excess, there will be chaotic wheezing and difficulty breathing, accompanied by a desire for water, or even refusal to drink; in cases of deficiency, there may be constricted breathing and prolonged exhalation. In cases of excess, the Xie Bai San and Tingli Wan should be used to purge, while in cases of deficiency, Ejiao San and Sheng Mai San combined with Gan Ju Tang should be used to supplement.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Coughing with an abundance of phlegm indicates that the essence of the kidneys is not returning to the source. It is advisable to use the Rehmannia Six Formula as the main treatment, supplemented with ingredients like prepared Morinda root, stir-fried Eucommia bark, and liquor-washed Cistanche, along with stir-fried fennel and stir-fried Euphorbia herbs, ground into a powder and formed into honey pills, then taken with a decoction of Ophiopogon.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern the void, not the solid. The Rehmannia formula addresses this. However, in cases of smallpox where the kidneys are solid, this notion is not articulated by the Qian family but is an error of the record-keeper, and it is unclear. To clarify doubts for future generations, there exist formulas to drain the kidneys, such as the Baixiang pill. There are also theories for tonifying the spleen and draining the kidneys, which may lead to children&#39;s misfortunes; thus, relying entirely on books is less beneficial than having none at all.</p>
<p>The human body consists of the lungs governing the skin and hair, the heart governing blood vessels, the spleen governing muscles, the liver governing tendons, and the kidneys governing the marrow. The kidneys, among the five organs, are akin to winter among the four seasons. The poison of sores and rashes emerges from the marrow, affecting the muscles, blood vessels, and skin, similar to how seasonal goods accumulate in winter, then disperse to give rise to spring life, summer growth, and autumn storage.</p>
<p>If it turns black and returns to the kidneys, it cannot disperse outward but instead retreats inward; this reflects a deficiency of true qi in the kidneys and an excess of pathogenic qi. Hence, formulas like the Baixiang pill and Niu Li syrup are established to dispel the pathogenic qi from within the kidneys, not to deplete the true qi. Moreover, the water in the kidneys nourishes and strengthens, filled with fluids.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the methods of supplementing and draining based on the strengths and weaknesses of the five organs, we interpret the classics. The classics say: when the evil qi is abundant, it is real; when the true qi is lost, it is deficient. The so-called &quot;real&quot; refers to the expelling of evil qi; the &quot;deficient&quot; refers to the replenishing of true qi. When true qi is robust, one is like a healthy child, how can there be a need to drain? If the liver is often in excess and the spleen often deficient, this indicates the inherent qi of the organs. The liver represents the lesser yang qi; at the birth of a child, like a tree budding, it embodies the growing energy of the lesser yang, gradually strengthening, hence its abundance. The intestines and stomach are delicate and thin, and the essence of grain is not yet sufficient, which accounts for the spleen&#39;s deficiency.</p>
<p>When infants exhibit bright and clear colors and have a strong, resonant voice, this indicates sufficient heart and lung qi. When they are able to consume milk and food, with regulated bowel movements, this shows adequate qi in the intestines and stomach. When the hands and feet are warm, and the muscles and bones are strong, this indicates sufficient kidney and liver qi. This is known as being easy to care for when free from illness, and indiscriminate use of medicine is unwise.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the complexion is pale and the voice is soft, this indicates insufficiency in heart and lung. If milk and food intake decreases and there are frequent vomiting and diarrhea, this shows insufficiency in the intestines and stomach. If the neck is soft, and the hands and feet are weak, this indicates insufficiency in liver and kidney. Such children are often ill and difficult to nurture. This distinguishes between the strengths and weaknesses of the five organs based on physical condition. For those who are ill, treatment should follow the specific strengths and weaknesses of the five organs.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment of Internal Organ Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The method of treatment is generally as follows: for liver diseases, the priority is to dispel wind and regulate qi; for heart diseases, the urgent approach is to suppress fire and tranquilize disturbances; for spleen diseases, it is necessary to warm the middle and resolve stagnation; for lung diseases, the focus is on descending qi and clearing phlegm; and for kidney diseases, the aim is to replenish true essence. This outlines the main principles of treatment. </p>
<p>If lung disease also presents with liver symptoms, where one grinds their teeth and yawns frequently, it is easier to treat, as liver deficiency can’t support the lung. However, if one is crying out sharply with a stiff neck and irritability, treatment becomes difficult. This is because prolonged lung disease leads to deficiency and coldness, while a strong liver can overpower the lung. Treatment should consider the freshness, duration, deficiency, and excess of the illness: for deficiency, nourish the mother; for excess, drain the child. </p>
<p>The liver, being primarily affected by wind, leads to yawning and irritability, along with heat in the mouth, which should be dispersed using Daqinggucao. If appetite is present and water intake is excessive, a small dose of Dahuangwan should be given, without excess purging. If there’s liver heat causing one to fidget with their clothing or twist objects, Xieqingwan is appropriate. For strong fever, excessive drinking, and wheezing, Bai San should be administered. When liver diseases overshadow the lung, particularly in autumn, where a strong liver prevails over a weak lung, it is necessary to tonify the spleen to treat the liver. Strengthening the spleen enables the mother to fortify the child. Use Bu spleen Yihuang San to treat liver with Xieqingwan.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the liver has wind, the eyes blink excessively without spasming; if heat arises from the heart, then spasms occur. The treatment is with Qing Wan for liver excess and Dao Chi San for heart issues. When the liver has heat, the eyes direct their gaze without spasming; the same treatment applies. When the liver is affected by wind, the body becomes stiff and straight, not spasming, and warmth does not affect the heart; in such cases, one should tonify the kidneys to treat the liver. The main treatment is with Di Huang Wan for kidney tonification and Qing Wan for liver excess. Regardless of whether the illness is new or chronic, it all stems from the movement of liver wind, which directs its action towards the head and eyes. The eyes pertain to the liver; when wind enters the eyes, they flutter lightly as if blown by wind, making it difficult for the child to remain still, hence the excessive blinking. If heat enters the eyes, it pulls on their tendons and both corners become tense, making it impossible to turn the gaze, hence the fixed stare. If accompanied by heart heat, spasms occur because both the mother (heart) and child (liver) possess real heat, leading to the clash of wind and fire. </p>
<p>In autumn, liver conditions are observed as the wood element strengthens the liver, overpowering the lungs. Therefore, it is advisable to tonify the lungs and drain the liver. In mild cases, liver issues alleviate; in severe cases, there may be pallor of the lips and death. </p>
<p>When there is heart heat, sleep is affected, and the breath feels warm within the mouth. Sometimes, there is a tendency to sleep with the face covered, and there may be grinding of teeth at night—all indicative of heart heat, for which Dao Chi San is the main treatment. When heart qi is heated, the chest also feels warm, creating an urge to speak but resulting in a desire to remain still as if feeling cold, hence the tendency to sleep face down. If heart qi is full, it creates a blockage of qi movement, and sleeping in a compact position hinders flow, thus one prefers to sleep on one’s back to allow for unobstructed upward and downward movement of qi; accordingly, Xie Xin San is the main treatment.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If one experiences agitation, coarse breathing, and wheezing, it is difficult to treat due to lung deficiency. Chronic spleen and lung disease leads to deficiency, resulting in pale lips. The spleen is the mother of the lungs; when both are deficient, they cannot nourish each other, hence the term &quot;timid.&quot; The lungs correspond to the lips; if the lips are pale and lustrous, it is a good sign, but if they are white like dry bones, it foretells death. Lung diseases that appear in spring indicate that the lungs overpower the liver; thus, one should tonify the kidneys and liver and treat the lungs. If the liver is weak, it leads to illness. To tonify the liver and kidneys, use Di Huang Wan; for treating the lungs, use Xie Bai San. In spring, if lung ailments arise and the lungs are robust, one should purge the lungs. In mild cases, the lung disease will recede; in severe cases, pale blue eyes may indicate fright. Additionally, if redness appears, it suggests a weak liver, which is also indicated by pale blue eyes.</p>
<p>A child with kidney deficiency is originally weak and timid, due to insufficient prenatal energy resulting in insufficient vital essence. Such children have often white sclera, a reflective forehead, a wide face, and a pale complexion, all of which are difficult to nurture, typically living only up to 88 days. If one indulges excessively in desires, they may not survive beyond 40 days. Some may develop kidney deficiency due to illness, which is not part of this discourse. Furthermore, insufficient kidney energy leads to sinking; certainly, heavy bones desire to drop down and hunch the body. The kidneys represent yin; thus, kidney deficiency causes light sensitivity, so one should tonify the kidneys with Di Huang Wan. When kidney ailments present in summer, water overcomes fire; the kidneys overpower the heart, and one should purge the kidneys. In mild cases, the illness may recede; in severe cases, palpitations may occur as well.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Liver</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang states: The liver governs wind. When it is full, there will be loud shouting and urgency in the neck, causing annoyance. When it is deficient, one may grind their teeth and yawn. If there is heat in the Qi, wind arises externally; if the Qi is warm, wind arises internally, to be treated with Daqing Gao. If one can continue to eat and drink without interruption, use Dahuang Wan to gently purge. If the liver is hot, the eyes will bulge without twitching, and the hands will fidget with clothing or twist items. Use Xieqing Wan to treat this. If there is strong heat, resulting in thirst and shortness of breath, Xie Bai San should be administered. </p>
<p>Liver ailments appear in autumn; if the lung is weak and cannot support the liver, benefit the spleen with Yihuang San, and Xieqing Wan should be used to treat the liver. If there is wind in the liver, the eyes will blink rapidly. If heart heat causes twitching, use Xieqing Wan for the liver, and Daohong San for the heart. In severe cases, the body may arch back, the eyes bulge without twitching, the heart is not affected by heat; use Dihuang Wan to nourish the kidneys, and Xieqing Wan to treat the liver. Those with pale lips should not be treated. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhang Jiegu states: The liver governs wind; if ill, it will cause wind to convulse and tense. If heart is strong in the liver, it is a pathogenic evil; if the lung seizes the liver, it is a thief evil; if the kidney regulates the liver, it is a deficiency evil. In all cases of liver illness, one must first examine the lungs and kidneys. The kidney is the mother of the liver; the lung is the thief of the liver. </p>
<p>Hence, if the liver is ill, and it is not due to the kidney water&#39;s inability to generate it, it is likely due to the lung&#39;s metal demon harming it. Therefore, if the cause is in the lungs, first treat the lungs and attack the demon; if the cause is in the kidneys, first nourish the kidneys to replenish the source. Then, assess the condition of the primary organ for emptiness or fullness and for cold or warmth. I secretly believe that if there are symptoms of excess heat in the liver channel leading to external wind, it is suitable to use Daqing Gao for treatment.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If after taking the medicine the symptoms still worsen, it indicates that the evil qi has left but the spleen qi is deficient. In this case, it is advisable to use Yigong San with additional Xiangfu and Angelica for replenishment. If there is liver channel deficiency heat, or internal wind generated from oppression and constriction, Yigong San and Di Huang Wan should be used for nourishment. If wind evil has entered the organs and causes cold food intake and constipation, this indicates internal excess of evil qi; thus, it is appropriate to use Dahuang Wan to purge it. If after purging there is a reduced appetite and an abdominal distension, this indicates internal deficiency of spleen qi; hence, Baizhu San should be used for replenishment. </p>
<p>If one has naturally weak qi and blood, possibly due to a post-illness condition, or from taking purgatives, and they often seek their collar, grind their teeth, yawn, and have pale eyes, this points to severe liver channel deficiency; therefore, Di Huang Wan should be urgently used to nourish the kidney and liver. If there are symptoms of choking breath, shortness of breath, and prolonged exhalation, this indicates severe lung channel deficiency; Yigong San should be urgently utilized to nourish spleen and lung. </p>
<p>If one cries out during the Shen (3-5 PM) and You (5-7 PM) hours, stares blankly, yawns irritably, feels anxious, and has shaky hands and feet, with a fever and thirst, this is due to the clash of wind and fire overpowering lung metal. Chaihu Zhi Zi San should be used to treat liver fire and promote liver blood; Yigong San should nourish spleen earth and promote lung metal. </p>
<p>If the lips appear pale, this indicates extreme spleen deficiency and is untreatable. For infants, symptoms often arise from the mother&#39;s indulgent diet, inappropriate breastfeeding, or due to the nurse’s diet causing agitation.

Heart issues manifest in winter, showing that fire overcomes water; one should nourish the kidneys to treat the heart, and mild cases may resolve on their own. If there is downward descent and silence, it indicates kidney deficiency and timidity. Furthermore, Zhang Jieguh stated: The heart governs heat; if the lungs invade the heart, it creates a slight pathogenic influence; if the liver invades the heart, it results in a deficiency; if the spleen invades the heart, it results in a real pathogenic influence; if the kidneys invade the heart, it leads to a thieving influence. Whenever the heart becomes ill, it is essential to first adjust the liver and kidneys. When liver qi flows smoothly, heart qi becomes harmonious; when liver qi is stagnant, heart qi becomes weak.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the five organs suffer illness, the disease will inevitably transmit to the organ it overcomes. The evil affecting the kidneys must transmit to the heart, hence one should first treat the kidneys to dispel the evil. Only when the liver and kidney channels are harmonized can one then assess the true and false conditions of the heart for treatment. I modestly believe that those who sleep on their backs do so because their chest is full of heat, thus they prefer to lie back and seek the empty space. Those who prefer to lie face down do so because their chest is deficient and hot, hence they prefer to lie prone to seek fullness. If it’s a case of fullness, one should adjust and treat the heart and liver; if it’s a case of deficiency, one should tonify the spleen and lungs. These two conditions should be distinguished clearly. Symptoms, such as teeth grinding, may share similarities and do not require rigid adherence to specifics. If one uses formulas like Xie Xin and Dao Chi, although the evil qi is dispelled, the illness persists; one must then tonify the vital qi. If the situation worsens, one must urgently warm and tonify the vital qi. If heart qi appears in winter, or if at the time of the Pig or Rat hours the illness worsens, or if there is a reluctance to speak, this indicates deficiency of kidney water and excess of heart fire; one should use Di Huang Wan.

If there are cold hands and feet due to a wind affliction, it indicates a weakness of the spleen. First use Huang San to replenish the spleen, then use Da Qing Gao to disperse it. Spleen diseases manifest similarly across the four seasons. Those in harmony are easier to treat, while those against the flow are hard to treat. A weak spleen may present with a red or yellow face; if it also interacts with the five organs, treat according to the symptoms. Moreover, Zhang Jiegu states: The spleen governs dampness; when sick, there is often diarrhea and excessive sleep, with a heavy and lethargic body. If the liver invades the spleen, it is a thief&#39;s evil; if the heart invades the spleen, it is a void&#39;s evil; if the lung invades the spleen, it is a real evil; if the kidney invades the spleen, it is a minor evil. In all spleen diseases, one must first investigate the liver and heart organs. Indeed, the liver is the ghost of the spleen, and the heart is the mother of the spleen.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When liver qi is excessive, ghostly evils persist; when heart qi is deficient, vitality is insufficient. One should harmonize liver qi and nourish heart qi. If the pulse indicates that both liver and heart are harmonious, then the spleen is affected, and one should assess the deficiency and excess to treat it. I suspect that in cases of actual evidence, the pathogenic qi is excessive while the vital qi is deficient. If the complexion is pallid, with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and the breath is cold from the mouth and nose, this pertains to cold water invading earth, and one should use Yi Huang San. If the complexion is bluish and lips dark, with vomiting, diarrhea, and cold in the hands and feet, this indicates spleen deficiency with cold, and one should use Gan Jiang Li Zhong Tang. If the complexion is sallow-yellow, and the hands and feet are not cold, this indicates a weak spleen, and one should use Ren Shen Li Zhong Tang. If there is a wind condition with cold in the hands and feet, expectoration, coughing, and diarrhea with abdominal distension, this indicates a deficiency in both spleen and lung qi, and one should use Wu Wei Yi Gong San to strengthen spleen qi, adding Fang Feng and Sheng Ma to expel external evils. If it arises during the time of Yin and Mao, one should use Liu Jun Zi, Chai Hu, and Sheng Ma to nourish spleen earth and pacify liver wood.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Lung</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang said: The lungs govern shortness of breath. When they are full, there is a sensation of fullness and rapid, chaotic breathing, sometimes accompanied by drinking water. When they are deficient, there is a feeling of blockage and shortness of breath. If the lungs are excessive and then attacked by wind-cold, there will be fullness in the chest and urgent, wheezing breath; this can be treated with Xie Bai San. If there is lung heat, pressing on the forehead, eyes, nose, and face will help; use Gan Ju Tang. If the lung deficiency causes heat, the lips will appear deep red; use Xie Bai San sparingly. If there is a weak lung, the lips will be pale; use Ejiao San. If there is a sensation of fullness and rapid, chaotic breathing leading to blockage, it is difficult to treat. If the condition is prolonged and the lips are white, it indicates deficiency in both spleen and lungs. If the lips are white like pig fat, it is auspicious; if they are white like dry bone, it indicates death. If lung disease appears in spring, the lungs are stronger than the liver. Use Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys, along with Xie Bai San to treat the lungs. If the eyes appear pale blue, it indicates imminent shock; if red, it indicates a weak liver. Moreover, Zhang Jiego stated: The lungs govern dryness; when they are affected, there is coughing and wheezing; thus, dryness must be moistened.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the heart dominates the lungs as a thief, the liver dominates the lungs as a mild evil, the kidneys dominate the lungs as a substantial evil, and the spleen dominates the lungs as a vacuous evil. When the lungs are afflicted, one must first observe the reality and vacuity of the heart and spleen. If heart fire scorches the metal element, one should suppress the heart and nourish the lungs. If the spleen’s qi is weak and cold, failing to support the lungs, and the lung qi is insufficient, then one is susceptible to wind evils, and it is advisable to tonify the spleen and lungs. If the spleen is solid and there is a sensation of fullness, with heat rising to the lungs, it is necessary to purge the spleen qi. If the heart and spleen are balanced yet the lungs are still ill, one must investigate the reality and vacuity for treatment. It is my view that for lung channel heat, one should use Xie Bai San; for lung qi deficiency, use Si Jun Zi Tang; for external evils invading, use Shen Su Yin; for heart fire blazing, use Ren Shen Ping Fei San; for solid fullness in the middle burner, use Da Cheng Qi; and if the spleen cannot nourish the lungs, use Yi Gong San. When lung qi is abundant, the evil qi within the lungs is also abundant; the pulse at the right inch will be superficial and strong, and it is appropriate to use Xie Bai San to drain it. If the lungs are deficient yet there is heat, clinging to the idea that lung heat injures the lungs and failing to use ginseng is a grave error; one should still apply ginseng according to certain conditions.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Kidney</strong></p>
<p>Qian Zhongyang said: The kidney governs the void and the real evidence; only when the pox and sores are real will they appear black and sunken. One must further differentiate between the evidence of the void and the real. For instance, if there is lung disease alongside liver symptoms, clenching teeth and yawning is easy to treat since the weakened liver cannot support the lung. However, if one stares directly, shouts, and cries, feeling restless and anxious, it is difficult to treat. This is because lung disease is cold and weak, while the liver is strong and real, overpowering the lung. </p>
<p>Assess the disease based on its new or long-standing condition, and whether it is void or real; if it is void, then nourish its mother, if it is real, then drain its child. The kidney is weakened due to insufficient prenatal energy, resulting in a diminished spirit, drooping eyelids, and a tendency for the eyes to be overly white, with a pale complexion, all of which are difficult to nourish, rarely exceeding eighty-eight years. If one indulges in sensual desires, they may perish before reaching forty. There are also cases where illness causes kidney weakness. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is said: insufficient kidney energy leads to downward descent. The weakened kidney causes heavy bones, resulting in a tendency to sag and hunch the body. Kidney water is yin; if the kidney is weak, the eyes lack luster and are sensitive to light, all of which can be treated with Rehmannia pills. Kidney disease appears in summer, as water conquers fire. For mild cases, the disease may resolve itself, but for severe cases, one should be alarmed by spasms and convulsions. </p>
<p>Zhang Jiego also stated: The kidney governs cold; from this disease, the feet and shins become cold and inversely affected. There is no real kidney condition; sores and rashes that are black and sunken represent reality and are the water controlling fire. If the heart invades the kidney, it becomes a subtle evil; if the lung invades the kidney, it is a void evil; if the liver invades the kidney, it is a real evil; if the spleen invades the kidney, it is a thieving evil.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the internal organs are weak and their proper functions are disrupted, harmful influences can invade, necessitating the reinforcement of the vital energy of the internal organs. If there are lung conditions like wheezing and cough arising in early spring, one should tonify the kidneys; if in summer, support the lungs; if in autumn, aid the spleen; and if in winter, tonify the heart while relieving the internal organs, which is referred to as a cold cough. Generally, when each of the five internal organs is in its rightful place, their energy is strong and no further tonification is required; while the areas affected by harmful influences should not be over-purged.</p>
<p>Among the five elements, it is only the kidneys (water) that, when strong, can suffer from external influences. This is because the lungs belong to metal, which emanates to the skin, governing the vital energy; while the kidneys belong to water, governing the bones and storing essence. The light and floating nature of qi can rise but cannot descend; the heavy and sinking nature of essence can descend but cannot rise, adhering to the properties of these substances.</p>
<p>Now, when the lung qi becomes heated and rises, it cannot descend to nourish the kidneys and is thus susceptible to harm, requiring urgent administration of cooling medicine to resolve it. The kidney qi must first seek the lungs. If dampness from the spleen affects the kidneys, it is necessary to eliminate the dampness from the spleen. However, if the spleen and lungs are balanced but the kidneys are actually diseased, one must examine the primary organ and treat it accordingly.</p>
<p>I surmise that conditions of downward sinking whereby the feet dislike being covered indicate that everything below the waist is governed by the kidneys, as the heart qi descends to the kidney region. The method is to use Rehmannia Six Formula to strengthen kidney water and control heart fire. If kidney water cannot be generated due to weakness of the spleen and lungs, one should use the Si Jun Zi Decoction and Rehmannia Six Formula to nourish the source of transformation. For sores and rashes that are dark and depressed, it indicates kidney deficiency with excess harmful qi, thus especially indicating the use of Rehmannia Six Formula.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<p>In the first month of pregnancy, it is referred to as &quot;white dew&quot;; in the second month, it is likened to &quot;peach blossom.&quot; When it reaches the third month, the right kidney produces a male, as the yin wraps around the yang; the left kidney produces a female, as the yang wraps around the yin. Then the kidneys give rise to the spleen, the spleen gives rise to the liver, the liver gives rise to the lungs, and the lungs give rise to the heart, thus generating those that overcome themselves. The kidneys belong to water, so the five organs are therefore yin. </p>
<p>Following this, the heart gives rise to the small intestine, the small intestine gives rise to the large intestine, the large intestine gives rise to the gallbladder, the gallbladder gives rise to the stomach, the stomach gives rise to the bladder, and the bladder gives rise to the three energizers, generating those that overcome their own nature. The small intestine belongs to fire, hence the six fu organs are therefore yang.</p>
<p>Next, the three energizers give rise to the eight vessels, the eight vessels give rise to the twelve meridians, the twelve meridians give rise to the twelve collaterals, the twelve collaterals give rise to one hundred eighty fine collaterals, the fine collaterals give rise to one hundred eighty entwined collaterals, the entwined collaterals give rise to thirty-four thousand sub-collaterals, the sub-collaterals give rise to three hundred sixty-five joints, the joints give rise to three hundred sixty-five major acupoints, and the major acupoints give rise to eighty-four thousand pores.

<p><strong>Medical Guidelines</strong> (Ming Dynasty, by Lou Ying)</p>
<p><strong>The Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The interdependence of the five organs leads to illnesses corresponding with seasonal changes. This reflects the expanded interpretations of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; on the method of conserving Qi, a concept previously unexplored. For instance, if liver disease manifests in spring or early morning, it indicates an inherent issue with the liver. If it later presents in autumn or late afternoon, corresponding to the lungs, and if the lungs are extremely deficient, the liver may prevail, thus requiring remedies for the spleen and lungs while draining the liver. I follow this principle accordingly. </p>
<p>The ancient texts state: Heat originates from the heart, cold from the kidneys, coughing rises from the lungs, wind from the liver, and diarrhea from the spleen. If diarrhea is accompanied by coughing and rising Qi, it indicates a spleen-lung condition, hence one should use a combination of Baihua and Yihuang powders. The spleen suffers from dampness, while the lungs suffer from dryness. If the Qi is reversed up and symptoms show diarrhea with a yellow complexion and rumbling intestines, one should take Lizhong Decoction. For those with diarrhea and vomiting, Fuling Banxia Decoction is advisable. If there is diarrhea with significant thirst and heat, Huangqin and Houpian Decoction is suitable. For those not thirsty but with less heat, Baizhu and Houpian Decoction should be used. Other combinations of the five organs should be extrapolated similarly. Further discussions will elaborate on seasonal approaches for medication.</p>
<p>The heart governs heat; if there is inherent or significant heat, Xiexin Decoction is prescribed. If it is excessive heat, Huanglian Xiexin Decoction is appropriate. In cases of deficiency leading to fright or palpitations, Shengxi San is used.</p>
<p>The lungs are influenced by the heart, presenting mild pathological factors such as wheezing with strong heat, in which case Xiebai Powder is utilized. The liver affects the heart with weak pathogenic factors, presenting with wind-heat; Da Qianghuo Decoction combined with Daqingwan is warranted.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

The spleen influences the lungs; if deficient, it leads to heaviness, phlegm, diarrhea, and coughing, treated with the Ginseng and Atractylodes Powder.</p>
<p>The liver governs wind; if ill, it results in convulsions or spasms. If the liver is in distress, consuming sweet foods helps to alleviate it, combined with sour and bitter to disperse. If excessive, it produces strong convulsions, treated with the Qing Pill. If deficient, it results in weaker convulsions, managed with the Dihuang Pill.</p>
<p>The heart affects the liver; if in excess, it brings vigorous heat and convulsions, treated with the Lijing Pill and Liangjing Pill. The lungs impact the liver; if evil qi is present and qi is strong, it results in yawning and slight convulsions; lung drainage is necessary, starting with tonifying the organ. For reinforcing the liver, the Dihuang Pill is used; for draining the lungs, the White Scattering Powder is needed. The spleen influences the liver; if slightly affected, it leads to excessive sleep and heaviness, and convulsions must first be stabilized, treated with the Qing Pill. If convulsions stop and other symptoms reappear, then a separate method should be established for treatment. The kidneys affect the liver; if deficient, they bring aversion to cold and yawning with convulsions, treated with the Qiang Huo Ointment.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The spleen governs dampness; when it is ill, there is often diarrhea, excessive sleep, and a feeling of heaviness and fatigue. The spleen suffers from dampness, so bitter foods should be consumed to dry it out. In cases of excessive dampness, diarrhea appears red and yellow, with closed eyes while sleeping; for this, Ban Xia and Huang Qi Decoction is used. In cases of deficiency, diarrhea is pale, with eyes open during sleep; for this, Bai Zhu Decoction is used.</p>
<p>The liver influences the spleen, causing evildoers, wind, diarrhea, and vomiting; for this, Fu Ling and Ban Xia Decoction is used. The heart affects the spleen, resulting in deficiency and heat, with heaviness and diarrhea; for this, Qiang Huo, Huang Qin, Cang Zhu, and Gan Cao Decoction is used. The lung influences the spleen, causing excessive conditions where food is consumed but leads to no bowel movements, and vomiting and coughing occur; for this, a decoction of areca nut and rhubarb is used, along with Ding Li pills. The kidney affects the spleen, causing mild evildoers, coldness, and diarrhea; for this, formulas like Li Zhong Wan are used.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern coldness; when they are ill, the legs and shins feel cold and inverted. Among the five organs, only the kidneys do not have an excess. If a child’s rash turns black and sinks, this indicates that the kidneys have excess water, countering heart fire.</p>
<p>The heart influences the kidneys, causing mild evildoers, internal heat without aversion to cold; for this, Gui Zhi Decoction is used. The lung affects the kidneys, leading to deficiency, wheezing, coughing with cold; for this, Bai Bu pills are used. The liver influences the kidneys, causing excess conditions with tightness and cold; for this, Li Zhong Wan is used. The spleen affects the kidneys, causing evildoers, heaviness, diarrhea, and cold; for this, Li Zhong Wan is also used.</p>
<p>In cases where the five organs are weak, it signifies that the proper regulation is not functioning, thus being harmed by external evildoers. It is important to replenish the upright qi of the original organ. For instance, if there is lung disease with wheezing and coughing appearing in early spring, one should tonify the kidneys. In summer, address the lung; in autumn, involve the lung with diarrhea; and in winter, tonify the heart while addressing the original organ, also known as cold diarrhea.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In general, when the five organs reach their natural states, the qi is abundant and cannot be further supplemented, while those that are subdued cannot be further drained. According to Jie Gu, liver disease manifests as a pale face, lung disease as a red face, spleen disease as a bluish face, kidney disease as a yellow face, and heart disease as a dark face. If liver disease presents with sudden shocks or convulsions, along with a pale face and symptoms like phlegm, saliva, and shortness of breath, these are difficult to treat. I infer similar cases from this.</p>
<p>For instance, before the spring equinox, when the wind is cold, one should use Rehmannia, Qianghuo, and Fengfeng, or take Rehmannia pills and alternate with Qingxia decoction. After the spring equinox, when the wind is warm, one should use Qianghuo, Fengfeng, and Huangqin, or take Qingxia pills and Daohong powder. After the summer begins, when it&#39;s hot, one should use Sanhuang pills and Daohong powder. After the summer solstice, when it&#39;s humid and hot, one should take a combination of Daohong powder and Xiehuang powder, or similar herbs like Huangqin, Ginseng, and Muxiang. After the autumn equinox, use Xiebai powder, and after the arrival of winter, use Rehmannia pills as a primary treatment, which is not subject to drainage.</p>
<p>Haicang states that for Liver Nourishment Pills: within the Siwu Decoction, add Fengfeng and Qianghuo in equal parts, ground into a fine powder, and then formed into honey pills. For the Liver Calming Pills: Xieqing pills, excluding Gardenia and Rhubarb, are used to treat liver deficiency. For the Kidney Draining Pills: they target a full and strong pulse, namely the aforementioned Rehmannia pills, substituting freshly prepared Rehmannia instead of the cooked version, and excluding Corni fruits. This treats the pulse of the left wrist. If the right wrist pulse is strong and full, use Fengsui Dan to drain it. The Rehmannia pills mentioned are the same as the Eight Flavor Pills by Zhang Zhongjing, minus cinnamon and aconite. If added with Schisandra, it becomes the Kidney Qi Pills, which nourish the lung&#39;s source and generate kidney water.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<p>The heart is connected to the tongue. The heart is an organ, and the small intestine is a cavity. Its color is red and it is dominant during the three months of summer. The heart tastes bitter, its fluid is sweat, it governs blood, its voice is speech, and its energy is breath. When in excess, it leads to laughter; when deficient, it results in worry. According to &quot;Qianjin,&quot; when the heart’s energy is full, one laughs incessantly; when it is empty, one weeps continuously.</p>

The liver tastes sour, its fluid is tears, it governs the tendons, its voice is weeping, and its energy is exhaled breath. When in excess, it leads to anger; when deficient, it results in sadness. According to &quot;Qianjin,&quot; anger is fullness, while sadness is emptiness.</p>
<p>The spleen is connected to the lips and mouth. The spleen is an organ, and the stomach is a cavity. Its color is yellow, and it is dominant during the four seasonal months. The spleen tastes sweet, its fluid is saliva, it governs the muscles, its voice is singing, and its energy is breath. When in excess, it leads to a feeling of fullness in the abdomen; when deficient, there is a lack of energy.</p>
<p>The lungs are connected to the nostrils. The lungs are an organ, and the large intestine is a cavity. Its color is white, and it is dominant during the three months of autumn. The lungs taste spicy, their fluid is mucus, they govern energy internally and the skin externally, their voice is weeping, and their energy is gasping. When in excess, it leads to wheezing; when deficient, it results in sighing.</p>
<p>The kidneys are connected to the ears. The kidneys are an organ, and the bladder is a cavity. Its color is black, and it is dominant during the three months of winter. The kidneys taste salty, their fluid is saliva, they govern the bones, their voice is groaning, and their energy is weakness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Five Organs and Their Pathologies</h3>
<p>When the heart is ill, the eyes become dark; the kidney injures the heart, leading to extreme deficiency of the water element (ren and gui). When the liver is ill, the skin becomes dark; the lung injures the liver, causing a deficiency of the metal element (geng and xin). When the spleen is ill, the lips turn cyan; the liver injures the spleen, resulting in deficiency of the wood element (jia and yi). When the lung is ill, the cheeks swell and the eyes turn red; the heart injures the lung, causing deficiency of the fire element (bing and ding). When the kidney is ill, the face swells and the lips turn yellow; the spleen injures the kidney, resulting in deficiency of the earth element (wu and ji).</p>
<h3>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiegugu stated: The five organs have a relationship of mother and child between deficiency and excess; the ghosts and thieves are subtle or apparent. If the intent is not reached, it becomes difficult to enter. The excess pathologies are in the front; the child can now cause the mother to be excessive, repelling the thieves that harm the mother. The child also calls for assistance from what the mother restrains, hence termed as excess pathology. The deficient pathologies are in the back; the mother brings the child’s ghost and thief, as the mother can cause the child to be deficient too. </p>
<p>The Inner Canon states: The child can cause the mother to be excessive, and the mother can cause the child to be deficient. This is what it&#39;s referring to. When the wife comes to dominate the husband, that’s termed a subtle pathology; when the husband comes to dominate the wife, that’s termed a thieving pathology. The treatment should focus on dispelling the ghosts and nourishing the root organ. When the root organ itself is ill, this is the proper and improper pathology. If it’s deficient, then nourish it; if it’s excessive, then drain it. The classic states: To nourish the sprouts, one must secure the roots; to cut from the bottom, one must dry out the top. To reverse the roots and cut at the base will ruin the true essence.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the liver prevails over the lungs, it leads to liver disease, with body heat causing convulsions, and signs of lung deficiency appear. When one experiences wheezing and shortness of breath, and the illness manifests during the hours of Shen, You, or Xu, this indicates a strong liver. The classics say: to be constrained and yet unable to control is termed true strength. The appropriate treatment is to tonify the spleen and lungs while draining the liver, using Daohong San and Xie Huang San as primary remedies. </p>
<p>Liu Zonghou pointed out that all of this relates to the five organs overcoming each other, with the pathological mechanisms closely tied to the principles of generation and overcoming in the five elements. Infants, upon first entering the swaddling, have not yet developed the seven emotions and six desires; they are merely physically fragile, with unsettled blood and qi, and their organ spirits are incomplete, leading to conditions of deficient and excessive organ energy. However, common practice often overlooks this principle, frequently attributing such cases to external pathogens or internal injuries and thus leading to many wrongful deaths. How tragic! The writings of the Qian family sometimes miss key points, yet fortunately, Jie Gu has supplemented them. Now, I have specifically added these discussions, which are truly of boundless benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Methods of Supplementing and Draining the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>Qian said: Whenever there is an initial deficiency, or it has already descended, one must first treat the mother organ before draining the child organ. For example, if the lungs are deficient but phlegm is excessive, this is an indication for purging; one should first benefit the spleen and then proceed to drain the lungs. The Xie Qing Wan is also known as Xie Gan Wan.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Qian states that there are no methods to nourish the liver, thus there are no liver-nourishing medicines. Wang Haizang made a refined honey pill from the Siwu Decoction, adding Fangfeng and Qianghuo, naming it the Liver Nourishing Pill. He also created the Zhen Gan Pill by removing Zhizi and Dahuang from the Xieqing Pill to treat liver deficiency. Daohong San disperses heat in the small intestine.</p>
<p>Xiexin Decoction drains the heart.</p>
<p>Anshen Wan treats heart deficiency with symptoms of heat, causing the spirit to be confused and disoriented.</p>
<p>Haizang&#39;s Babushisan stabilizes the mind and is a proper heart tonic.</p>
<p>Yihuang San, also known as Bupi San, is said by Haizang to tonify the spleen and dry dampness. Dongyuan notes it treats cold dampness in the stomach, nausea, abdominal pain, and is a holy medicine for diarrhea with clear discharge. </p>
<p>Xiehuang San, also known as Xiepisan, is noted by Haizang to drain heat from the spleen.</p>
<p>Ejiao San, also called Bulei San, as stated by Haizang, treats the lungs. Xingren primarily drains the lungs, unlike ginseng, Asparagus adscendens, or Ophiopogon japonicus.</p>
<p>Xie Bai San, also named Xie Fei San, according to Haizang, addresses lung heat with symptoms of bone steaming and spontaneous sweating, directly draining this condition. Zhizi and Huangqin also drain the lungs, differentiating between qi and blood.</p>
<p>Dihuang Wan is simply the Jinkui Eight Ingredients Pill without Gui and Fu. Haizang claims it treats kidney deficiency leading to headaches, particularly for sallow symptoms and the pulse being weak.</p>
<p>Qian argues that there are no draining methods for the kidneys, hence no kidney-draining medicines. Haizang&#39;s Xie Shen Wan treats a full and robust pulse, similar to the prior Dihuang Wan, substituting Shudihuang for Shengdihuang and omitting Sanjue. This addresses the primary pulse of the left hand. If the right pulse is full and strong, treat it with Fengsui Dan.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;Notes: When the heart does not receive heat, and there is twitching without convulsion, or the convulsion is mild, both should be treated by supplementing the kidney and treating the liver with Kidney Qi Pills. If the heart rides on the liver along with other symptoms, refer to the &#39;Essentials&#39; for more details. The term &#39;ride&#39; is like riding in a vehicle. The interactions among the five organs are unpredictable; for instance, liver disease must first treat the lungs and supplement the kidneys, and then examine the liver for deficiencies or excesses to adjust accordingly. The other organs follow this principle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heart shock is hard to express, leading to a desire to lie down.&quot;<br>&quot;Notes: Heart shock causes twitching. Frustration and heat rise, leading to a strong tongue wishing to speak but unable to, causing crying. Chest heat results in a desire to lie down to cool off. Suitable remedies include Heart-Drain Decoction, Guide Red Powder, and Small Fresh Rhinoceros Powder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In deficiency, it leads to fatigue and increased anxiety.&quot;<br>&quot;Notes: Use Warm Shock Pill as the main remedy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Spleen fatigue leads to body heat, thirst, and loss of appetite.&quot;<br>&quot;Notes: Spleen fatigue refers to exhaustion. When excessive, it causes fatigue and sleep without opening the eyes, body heat, thirst for water, and possible yellow or red urine either in retention or leakage. The remedy should be Yellow Drain Powder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In deficiency, it causes vomiting and diarrhea, yielding phlegm from wind.&quot;<br>&quot;Notes: In deficiency, there is regurgitation of a foul taste, diarrhea that is white, excessive sleeping with eyes open, and gradual onset of wind in the limbs and possibly phlegm; suitable remedies include Qian&#39;s White Atractylodes Powder, Different Effects Powder, and Regulating Middle Pill. If the liver acts on the spleen, leading to wind and vomiting, add Huangqin to Erchen Decoction.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> If the kidneys are insufficient, children with kidney deficiency are often hard to nurture and may have a high risk of early death; those who become deficient due to illness can be replenished. </p>
<p>If there is downward sinking accompanied by heat in the feet desiring to ascend.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> If sinking occurs, the bones feel heavy, leading to a desire to bend down. Hot feet dislike coverings, and heart fire descends to the kidneys, so root a Kidney Qi Pill or Zheng Qi Decoction. Moreover, if lung disease is heavy and follows with liver deficiency, it is easier to treat; if with liver heat, it is harder to treat. This is because prolonged lung disease leads to cold deficiency, while strong liver energy can dominate. </p>
<p>The classics say: to be controlled and yet unable to control is called true strength. Thus, the method should be to nourish the spleen and lungs first, then drain the liver. When the lungs are dominant, it is necessary to nourish the liver and drain the lungs. However, in cases of chronic cough and deficiency, Xie Bai San should not be taken; the Kidney Qi Pill is more appropriate. </p>
<p>The diseases of the five organs do not escape the principles of the five elements of generation and overcoming, leading to imbalances of deficiency and excess in the organs. The common perception does not analyze these principles, often hastily attributing them to external pathogens or internal injuries, leading to ineffective treatments and unnecessary deaths. The contributions of Qian and Jie Gu are indeed substantial!**<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The spleen governs the lips; if it fails, one cannot close them over the teeth, nor can one suckle. The eyes are directed downwards; the eye sockets belong to the spleen; if they fail, they sink. One cannot remain in the human world.</p>
<p>The lungs correspond with the color white; do not let them show signs of failure. If the nose turns bluish and the eye sockets are dark and dry, the abdomen is distended. The lungs govern the nose; if they fail, the liver will reverse and cause a bluish color. Furthermore, if the lungs fail, there will be no mucus, hence the dark and dry nostrils. The lungs also govern the eyelids; if they fail, they will sink. A straight neck with rapid breathing indicates that the lungs govern breath; if they fail, breathing becomes urgent and the neck straightens in an attempt to draw in air. When breath is exhausted, the chest will feel full and distended, producing outgoing breath without a return. In autumn, encountering this condition, one’s four directions will be estranged.</p>
<p>In the kidneys, there is cold sweat at all times, frequent night urination, causing shock. When the kidneys fail, yin and yang become separated, hence the cold sweat appears and urination cannot be controlled. Essence is where the spirit resides; if it fails, the spirit departs, causing frequent shock at night. The kidneys are associated with yin, and night also belongs to yin. The whole body breaks out in grain-like sores; the hands and feet feel as cold as ice. This is because yang cannot warm the body. The head tilts and is difficult to lift; the face is dark and lacks spirit. When the kidneys fail, the heavenly pillar and bones collapse, the face becomes dark and devoid of spirit. This condition corresponds with the elements of ren and gui; in winter, one may perish.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

The lungs govern qi; if there is heat in the lungs, it generates heat and upward steam, preventing it from nourishing the kidneys, thus causing evil to affect the kidneys. Hence, the source of kidney disease lies in the lungs. Furthermore, dampness from the spleen channel can harm the kidneys; therefore, it is necessary to clear lung heat and remove spleen dampness. If the disease arises from this channel itself, it should be nourished and supplemented. Spleen diseases manifest nearby; they should be treated similarly. Those that present normally are easy to treat, while those that present abnormally are difficult to treat. If the spleen is deficient, the complexion will appear yellow. The five organs interact; treatment should follow the symptoms. Note: According to ancient texts, when diseases of the spleen arise, one must first examine the deficiency or excess of the liver and heart and treat accordingly. The liver is the spleen's thief, while the heart is the spleen's mother. If liver qi is strong, it hinders the spleen; if heart qi is deficient, the spleen becomes weak. Thus, when the liver overacts on the spleen, it leads to wind-dampness causing vomiting; in such cases, the method of administering Fu Ling and Ban Xia decoction is appropriate. If heart qi is robust and there is strong heat, leading to heaviness and diarrhea, one should resort to Qiang Huo, Huáng Qín, Cāng Zhú, and Gān Cǎo decoction. If the lungs overact on the spleen causing coughing and constipation while diet is normal, then Chefing and Dà Huáng decoction should be administered, along with the use of Téng Li Wán. If the kidneys overact on the spleen resulting in aversion to cold and diarrhea, methods like the Rì Zhōng Wán should be used. I humbly believe that the symptoms of the five organs interact in ways that are concealed and unpredictable, yet the mechanism of disease does not stray from the principles of the five elements of generation, overcoming, and transformation. Furthermore, since children do not have the seven emotions fully developed, their ailments often arise from weak and frail constitutions and incomplete blood and qi, leading to diseases where the five organs overpower each other. Therefore, one should prioritize treating the mother (root cause) rather than focusing solely on the child (symptoms), as this often leads to mistakes."},{"anchor":"trans-10p","marker":"10p","type":"translation","text":"**Secret of Infant Care** **(Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan)** **General Discussion on the Diagnosis and Treatment of the Five Organs** All diseases arise from the five organs; if one does not understand the organs and bowels, it is futile. By carefully combining color and pulse for diagnosis, it is not difficult to adapt prescriptions and treat ailments. When the five organs are in harmony, no disease arises. Whether it be due to imbalances from cold and heat or disruptions in diet, maladies arise: wind injures the liver, heat affects the heart, cold harms the lungs, dampness injures the kidneys, and dietary issues damage the spleen. Correspondingly, the colors are as follows: the liver is green, the heart red, the spleen yellow, the lungs white, and the kidneys black. For the pulses: the liver is string-like, the heart is surging, the spleen is slow, the lung is fine, and the kidneys are deep. In terms of symptoms, the liver governs wind, the heart is associated with fright, the spleen deals with fatigue, the lungs are linked to wheezing, and the kidneys signify deficiency. Regarding treatment: the heart, lungs, and spleen may have both tonifying and reducing methods, while the liver solely has reducing techniques, and the kidneys have only tonification without reduction. The assessment of color, pulse, symptoms, and treatment is fundamentally based on the five organs; understanding this deeply is termed superior skill. Among the five organs, the liver is often excessive, the spleen commonly insufficient, and the kidneys frequently deficient. The heart's heat equates it with fire, akin to the liver, while the delicate lungs, once injured, do not easily recover. People often say the liver is easily excessive and the spleen often deficient; I also say the heart is often excessive and the lungs often deficient. Excess indicates fullness, while deficiency indicates emptiness."},{"anchor":"trans-11p","marker":"11p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Inner Canon\" says: When pathogenic Qi is strong, there is fullness; when the true Qi is depleted, there is emptiness. This refers to what is in excess and what is insufficient, not merely the distinction between fullness and emptiness as stated in the classics. The liver, when in excess, belongs to wood, thriving in spring, which is the season of the lesser yang energy, the source for all things to flourish. The newborn is called a sprout because it is like the buds of grass and trees, which are initially nourished by the vital energy and are at their most vigorous stage; hence, it is said that the liver is in excess. Excess indicates a natural surplus of yang. The spleen is often deficient because it governs the energy of earth. In infancy, the only nourishment is breast milk; since solid food has not yet been ingested, the spleen has not yet been engaged in its function, and thus its energy remains weak. Therefore, it is said to be insufficient. Insufficiency indicates a natural deficiency of dietary energy. The heart is also described as having an excess; it belongs to fire and thrives in summer, which is the manifestation of vigorous fire energy. The kidney, however, signifies deficiency, as it refers to the lack of vital essence inherited from the parents after birth. The lungs too are often deficient; they are delicate organs, difficult to regulate and easily injured. Both the spleen and the lungs belong to the greater yin, and can be harmed by the extremes of cold and heat in nature; should one be affected, the lungs are the first to suffer; similarly, the cold and heat in food can harm the spleen first when in excess. Thus, it is said that both the spleen and the lungs are deficient. The liver is associated with wind and wood, governing the generation of wind, with manifest symptoms clearly observable in the eyes."},{"anchor":"trans-12p","marker":"12p","type":"translation","text":"Although purging is of no use to tonify, the energy of the lesser yang is akin to spring. The liver, associated with the foot Jueyin and the wood element, generates wind, and thus it governs wind. According to the Qian family, the liver governs wind; in fact, it manifests through the eyes with straight gazes, loud calls, yawning, irritability, and a tight neck. If deficient, there may be teeth grinding and excessive yawning; if heat is present, symptoms manifest externally, while damp qi arises internally. These are indications of liver disease. The liver’s orifice is the eyes, so when ill, one often observes symptoms through the eyes. If there is wind in the liver, the eyes may twitch; if there is heat, the gaze may be direct; if there is liver disease, conditions such as a white membrane covering the eyes may occur. Furthermore, the liver governs the tendons, and if diseased, the tendons may be tight, leading to a stiff neck and spasms. The liver governs anger; if afflicted, one may display a hasty temperament, loud cries, and severe cases may lead to testicular swelling, commonly referred to as \"qi lump.\" When the liver is in the lower jiao, heat can cause difficulty in urination and bowel movements. The liver houses the soul; if liver heat is present, one may search for clothing, fidget with objects, or in severe cases, grasp at empty space and touch the bed, indicating a loss of soul. The Qian family notes a formula called \"Xieqing Pill\" for liver disease but does not suggest tonification, declaring that liver qi is excessive. However, the liver belongs to the lesser yang; thus, it is essential for nurturing life. A healthy liver should not be purged to diminish vital energy, nor should it be tonified to promote growth. The liver and gallbladder were originally treated with fire; within wood, there is fire that no one recognizes."},{"anchor":"trans-13p","marker":"13p","type":"translation","text":"Water cannot overcome the fire of the dragon thunder; only sweet and warm differences can control it. Diseases of the liver and gallbladder treated by fire stem from the existence of fire within wood. The \"Records of the Fire Man\" states: knowing that there is fire in the void, when wood is pleasing, it becomes bright. This is its verification. The fire of the liver and gallbladder cannot be extinguished by water or subdued by cold; it is also called the fire of the dragon thunder. Only sweet and warm remedies, such as ginseng and licorice, can control it. Therefore, it is said that sweetness can drain fire. The \"Internal Classic\" states: pungent substances disperse it, such as Chuanxiong and Fangfeng. It also states: pungent and sweet disperse for the yang. Using pungent and sweet medicines together, the so-called fire stagnation can be released. This is the general principle for treating liver diseases. For liver heat, one may drain it with Qingpian pills or Danggui and Aloe pills. For a firm liver, the same method applies. For liver deficiency, it is replenished with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill. The liver is the child of the kidney; when deficient, one should nourish its mother. For liver cold, one uses the Wendan Decoction along with Wu Zhu Yu and ginger. In children’s diseases, if they cannot focus their gaze, or if their eyes do not move or cannot close, or if they open their eyes but cannot close them, or if they cry without tears, or do not cry but tears flow, all indicate a severe liver condition. The heart is the dwelling of the spirit, easily startled, with colors and pulses intertwined, suffering from the invasion of heat. In reality, one should avoid suspicion by draining the bowels.

In actuality, this manifests as crying and fever, or restlessness after drinking water. In deficiency, there is fatigue, palpitations, and unease—this indicates a heart ailment. The heart governs blood vessels; color reflects the essence of blood, while pulse indicates the heart's condition. If the complexion appears rosy and the pulse is strong and frequent, it signifies an excess of heart qi, making the child easier to nurture. Conversely, if the complexion appears dull and the pulse is weak and fine, it indicates deficiency, leading to illness and making the child difficult to care for. Observing the shape, color, and pulse reveals the heart's true state. The heart dislikes heat; when it contends with wind, it leads to convulsions, hence the liver produces wind, which, when heated by the heart, results in convulsions. The heart is associated with fire; when fire is intense, body fluids become depleted, causing thirst. The heart houses the spirit; in heat, the spirit becomes chaotic, leading to restlessness in sleep. If a child prefers to sleep with their face covered, it indicates that heart qi is hot and the chest feels warm, making it hard to speak yet desiring coldness, thus they cover their face when sleeping. When heart qi is abundant, it moves freely; covering the face can obstruct qi flow, hence the preference for sleeping on the back. If the body is stretched upwards, this is termed \"ascending,\" which also indicates heart heat.

Conditions in children such as tumors, red spots, rashes, and skin ailments are all attributed to heart heat. The Qian family treats heart heat diseases with Daohong San, which is a laxative for the small intestine. The heart is the sovereign and should not be disturbed; laxatives are used to avoid suspicion. If the heart is deficient, the ruler is uneasy, hence Anshen Wan is used to nourish it. The heart is the organ of fire; it often suffers from dispersion without consolidation. Master Sun's Shengmai San is to be taken in summer; its sourness from Schisandra can consolidate the dissipated energy. For treating children's heart conditions, one can expand and fill the heart. Therefore, for internal heart heat diseases, remedies like Daohong San, Xuanshen Decoction, and Dongyuan Anshen Wan are appropriate; for external manifestations like sores in the mouth or tongue, Xixin San is indicated. For those with deficient heart Qi, Qian's Anshen Wan is recommended; for those who easily startle, Hupo Baolong Wan is suitable.

These all indicate a severed heart condition, which cannot be treated. In pediatric prescriptions, many spleen diseases arise simply from excessive dairy and food intake, leading to persistent ailments. Whether from hunger or fullness, both can create illness, as cold and heat invade, disrupting the qi. The \"Inner Canon\" states: the spleen and stomach are the officials of storage, where food and grains are gathered. At birth, the spleen is thin and weak, and can easily be harmed by food, hence it is said that the spleen is often insufficient. Qian says: the spleen governs heaviness; when it is full, there is tiredness and warmth followed by thirst; when it is deficient, it produces vomiting and diarrhea leading to wind. This indicates spleen disease. The spleen belongs to earth, which is stable, hence spleen diseases favor heaviness. Earth governs dampness. When dampness damages, it leads to swelling, bloating, jaundice, and persistent vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in chronic convulsions. The \"Inner Canon\" states: under the energy of earth, wood energy supports it. Earth represents the earth itself, and this relates to the abdomen; therefore, spleen diseases may manifest as abdominal pain, and spleen-related conditions result in a distended abdomen and blue veins. The orifice of the spleen is the lips; if there is wind in the spleen, the mouth may twitch and the lips move; if there is heat, there may be bad breath and sores on the lips; if there is cold, drooling at the corners of the mouth occurs, known as stagnation of the lips.

Injury from food may lead to accumulation, and prolonged accumulation can result in habitual disorders. The spleen governs body fluids; heat in the spleen causes dry mouth and a need for water. In deficiency, body fluids do not generate, leading to sores. Regarding the differences and similarities between the spleen and stomach, it is said that the stomach receives grains, while the spleen transforms them. To regulate the spleen and stomach, one must adapt to their respective cold and warmth and manage their diet. Therefore, overeating damages the stomach, while hunger harms the spleen; heat injures the stomach, while cold affects the spleen. The stomach prefers coolness, while the spleen enjoys warmth; thus, one cannot treat them the same. Yin and yang must harmonize for balance, and one must not rely solely on either extreme of heat or cold. The spleen prefers warmth and dislikes cold, while the stomach enjoys coolness and shuns heat; their preferences differ, making it difficult to adhere to a single method. The spleen and stomach belong to the earth element, located centrally to respond to their surroundings. Hence, the principles must include the four seasonal qi and the harmony of the five tastes. The four qi are cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. The five tastes are sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salty. Pungent and sweet represent yang, while sour, bitter, and salty represent yin. When qi and taste combine, it is termed yin-yang harmonization, achieving balance.

However, regarding the stomach and spleen, for spleen heat, use Xie Huang San; for stomach heat, use Ren Shen Bai Hu Tang; for cold in the spleen and stomach, use Li Zhong Tang Wan; for deficiency of the spleen and stomach, employ Yi Gong San, Tiao Yuan Tang, Ren Shen Bai Shu San, and Yang Pi Wan; for food stagnation, use Xiao Ji Wan and Bao He Wan; for lingering food accumulation, use Zhi Po Da Huang Wan; for dampness prevailing, use Wei Ling Wan; for evolving sores, use Fei Er Wan; and for already formed sores, use Ji Sheng Wan.

The lungs are the most elevated, serving as the crown of the organs.

According to the Qian family, the lungs control panting, which indeed manifests as disordered and rapid breathing; some may drink water, while others may not; if deficient, there’s prolonged difficulty in exhaling. This is a symptom of lung disease. The Nanjing states: cold harms the lungs. If a child wears clothing that is too thin, it may lead to cold injury. The Neijing states: heat harms the lungs. If a child is overdressed, it may lead to heat injury. Cold and heat injury the lungs causes reversed qi, resulting in panting and coughing. The nose is the orifice of the lungs; if the lungs are affected by wind, sneezing and a runny nose occur; if affected by cold, it results in nasal congestion and difficult breathing; if affected by heat, it causes dryness of the nose, or even nosebleeds; lung sores lead to red and ulcerated nostrils. The lungs govern the skin and hair; if the lungs are deficient, the skin becomes dry and the hair scorched. In cases of persistent panting and coughing, if panting does not stop, the face becomes swollen; if coughing does not stop, the sternum becomes protruded, referred to as \"turtle chest.\" Sudden shock leads to a sign of death. The lungs belong to metal, and their essence is dry; in illness, there is unquenchable thirst and a preference for drinking water, known as \"diaphragmatic consumption.\" The true diaphragm and lung qi communicate with heaven; medicinal use of clear soup is analogous to this.

The strength or weakness, longevity or premature death of a child is especially connected to this. A complete mastery requires no deficiency. If the kidney qi is insufficient, it will sink down, as the heavy bones desire to drop and retract the body. Kidney water is of the yin; if the kidneys are deficient, the eyes fear light. The child is fundamentally weak and timid, stemming from a failure of the prenatal qi which leads to insufficient spirit. The whites of the eyes are abundant, and the skull becomes relaxed; the complexion appears pale and white, all of which are difficult to nourish. Sometimes, this could be due to illness rather than kidney deficiency; this belongs to the signs of illness. The kidneys govern the bones; if the kidneys are deficient, the marrow is not full.

The Qian clan's treatment mainly focuses on replenishment. The classic mentions that sores and rashes require purgation and the rest. Water represents yin, and fire represents yang; when one water cannot withstand two fires, it indicates excess yang and insufficient yin, clearly showing the deficiency at the root of the kidneys. Therefore, the Qian clan only uses the Replenishing Kidney Dihuang pill. They dare not purge, due to a lack of concrete evidence. Some claim that for rashes, the kidneys should not be nourished but instead purged. This statement is quite erroneous. The kidneys govern fluids; the blood transformed in rashes becomes water, and this water transforms into pus, all of which are derived from the kidney's fluids. If the kidney water is absent, the sores would dry up, turn black, and lead to death. How could one possibly purge? The sickness of rashes labeled as returning to the kidneys indicates that the poison of the sores and rashes arises from the marrow and manifests externally on the skin; when it turns black and sinks back into the marrow, it becomes harmful. This is not harm caused by the surface but a disease of excess fire and diminished water.

The discussion of the internal organs is based on the mental/spiritual aspect, distinguishing clear methods of supplementation and draining. If they are seen to share coexisting diseases, it is more appropriate to consider their interrelation and modify the approach accordingly. According to the \"Nanjing\", there are discussions about five evils: The genuine condition involves the internal organs themselves, while the external pathologies that come from the front are considered real; those that come from behind are seen as empty; evils that arise from being overpowered are termed subtle evils, and those that do not hold power over are referred to as thieves. This aligns with the theory of the five elements of generation and overcoming. Qian’s assessment states that the liver governs wind, the heart governs fright, the spleen governs obstruction, the lungs govern wheezing, and the kidneys govern emptiness. All of these pertain to primary internal diseases, termed genuine and evil, thus establishing methods of five supplements and six drains. Mr. Jiegu took the words of the Nanjing to elucidate the evidence of transformation in the five organs, supplementing aspects that Qian’s theory did not cover, ensuring a complete method. Hence, wind harms the liver, heat harms the heart, dampness harms the lungs, cold harms the kidneys, and exhaustion from food intake injures the spleen.

The other organs resemble this pattern. For detailed understanding, refer to the \"Forty-Nine Difficulties.\" In the discussion of treatment methods for the five organs, if the liver is directly affected, the treatment should focus solely on the liver, using Qing Wan for drainage. If the heart is invading the liver, the appropriate remedy is to use Dao Chi to drain the heart, which effectively addresses the root issue. If the kidney injures the liver, one should use Jiang Fu Si Ni Tang to strengthen the kidney deficiency, thereby nourishing its mother. If the lung transmits to the liver, the recommended approach is to use Xie Bai San to drain the lung and Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver, first nourishing and then draining. If the spleen burdens the liver, it is advisable to use Tiao Yuan Tang to benefit the spleen and regulate the liver. The same reasoning applies to the other organs. For other methods, there is no need for rigid adherence; they can be understood and applied flexibly. These all address the initial onset of the illness. Moreover, when one organ's illness affects another, it is termed a \"concurrent syndrome,\" and the treatment should consider the urgency of the primary and secondary conditions.

In general, a child’s spleen issues are often due to improper balancing of milk and food. Knowing that other organ problems require harmonizing the stomach is vital; otherwise, it can lead to malnutrition and suffering. The stomach governs the intake of grains, while the spleen is responsible for their digestion. Hunger can harm the stomach, and overfeeding can insult the spleen. Children often suffer from overeating. If a mother is robust and has abundant milk, seeking to prevent the child from crying can lead to excessive breastfeeding, which can damage the milk's properties. Conversely, if the mother is weak and thin, her milk will be scarce, and to soothe the child’s cries, she may resort to giving them grains, meats, pastries, and fruits, leading to overindulgence and harm from food. Thus, children's ailments are mostly related to the stomach. The five organs rely on the stomach's qi for nourishment. The stomach represents a balance of vital energy, unlike the individual weaknesses of the five organs. If any of the organs are affected, whether through purging or tonifying, one must be cautious not to disturb the stomach's qi. If the stomach's qi is damaged, it may lead to inability to eat and weight loss, or good appetite with weight loss, resulting in malnutrition which cannot be treated.

Conversely, if the complexion is pale and the voice is soft, this indicates insufficiency in heart and lung. If milk and food intake decreases and there are frequent vomiting and diarrhea, this shows insufficiency in the intestines and stomach. If the neck is soft, and the hands and feet are weak, this indicates insufficiency in liver and kidney. Such children are often ill and difficult to nurture.

This outlines the main principles of treatment. If lung disease also presents with liver symptoms, where one grinds their teeth and yawns frequently, it is easier to treat, as liver deficiency can’t support the lung. However, if one is crying out sharply with a stiff neck and irritability, treatment becomes difficult. This is because prolonged lung disease leads to deficiency and coldness, while a strong liver can overpower the lung. Treatment should consider the freshness, duration, deficiency, and excess of the illness: for deficiency, nourish the mother; for excess, drain the child. The liver, being primarily affected by wind, leads to yawning and irritability, along with heat in the mouth, which should be dispersed using Daqinggucao. If appetite is present and water intake is excessive, a small dose of Dahuangwan should be given, without excess purging. If there’s liver heat causing one to fidget with their clothing or twist objects, Xieqingwan is appropriate. For strong fever, excessive drinking, and wheezing, Bai San should be administered. When liver diseases overshadow the lung, particularly in autumn, where a strong liver prevails over a weak lung, it is necessary to tonify the spleen to treat the liver.

When the liver is affected by wind, the body becomes stiff and straight, not spasming, and warmth does not affect the heart; in such cases, one should tonify the kidneys to treat the liver. The main treatment is with Di Huang Wan for kidney tonification and Qing Wan for liver excess. Regardless of whether the illness is new or chronic, it all stems from the movement of liver wind, which directs its action towards the head and eyes. The eyes pertain to the liver; when wind enters the eyes, they flutter lightly as if blown by wind, making it difficult for the child to remain still, hence the excessive blinking. If heat enters the eyes, it pulls on their tendons and both corners become tense, making it impossible to turn the gaze, hence the fixed stare. If accompanied by heart heat, spasms occur because both the mother (heart) and child (liver) possess real heat, leading to the clash of wind and fire. In autumn, liver conditions are observed as the wood element strengthens the liver, overpowering the lungs. Therefore, it is advisable to tonify the lungs and drain the liver. In mild cases, liver issues alleviate; in severe cases, there may be pallor of the lips and death. When there is heart heat, sleep is affected, and the breath feels warm within the mouth. Sometimes, there is a tendency to sleep with the face covered, and there may be grinding of teeth at night—all indicative of heart heat, for which Dao Chi San is the main treatment. When heart qi is heated, the chest also feels warm, creating an urge to speak but resulting in a desire to remain still as if feeling cold, hence the tendency to sleep face down.

The spleen suffers from dampness, so bitter foods should be consumed to dry it out. In cases of excessive dampness, diarrhea appears red and yellow, with closed eyes while sleeping; for this, Ban Xia and Huang Qi Decoction is used. In cases of deficiency, diarrhea is pale, with eyes open during sleep; for this, Bai Zhu Decoction is used. The liver influences the spleen, causing evildoers, wind, diarrhea, and vomiting; for this, Fu Ling and Ban Xia Decoction is used. The heart affects the spleen, resulting in deficiency and heat, with heaviness and diarrhea; for this, Qiang Huo, Huang Qin, Cang Zhu, and Gan Cao Decoction is used. The lung influences the spleen, causing excessive conditions where food is consumed but leads to no bowel movements, and vomiting and coughing occur; for this, a decoction of areca nut and rhubarb is used, along with Ding Li pills. The kidney affects the spleen, causing mild evildoers, coldness, and diarrhea; for this, formulas like Li Zhong Wan are used. The kidneys govern coldness; when they are ill, the legs and shins feel cold and inverted. Among the five organs, only the kidneys do not have an excess. If a child’s rash turns black and sinks, this indicates that the kidneys have excess water, countering heart fire. The heart influences the kidneys, causing mild evildoers, internal heat without aversion to cold; for this, Gui Zhi Decoction is used. The lung affects the kidneys, leading to deficiency, wheezing, coughing with cold; for this, Bai Bu pills are used. The liver influences the kidneys, causing excess conditions with tightness and cold; for this, Li Zhong Wan is used. The spleen affects the kidneys, causing evildoers, heaviness, diarrhea, and cold; for this, Li Zhong Wan is also used. In cases where the five organs are weak, it signifies that the proper regulation is not functioning, thus being harmed by external evildoers. It is important to replenish the upright qi of the original organ. For instance, if there is lung disease with wheezing and coughing appearing in early spring, one should tonify the kidneys. In summer, address the lung; in autumn, involve the lung with diarrhea; and in winter, tonify the heart while addressing the original organ, also known as cold diarrhea."},{"anchor":"trans-54p","marker":"54p","type":"translation","text":"In general, when the five organs reach their natural states, the qi is abundant and cannot be further supplemented, while those that are subdued cannot be further drained. According to Jie Gu, liver disease manifests as a pale face, lung disease as a red face, spleen disease as a bluish face, kidney disease as a yellow face, and heart disease as a dark face. If liver disease presents with sudden shocks or convulsions, along with a pale face and symptoms like phlegm, saliva, and shortness of breath, these are difficult to treat. I infer similar cases from this. For instance, before the spring equinox, when the wind is cold, one should use Rehmannia, Qianghuo, and Fengfeng, or take Rehmannia pills and alternate with Qingxia decoction. After the spring equinox, when the wind is warm, one should use Qianghuo, Fengfeng, and Huangqin, or take Qingxia pills and Daohong powder. After the summer begins, when it's hot, one should use Sanhuang pills and Daohong powder. After the summer solstice, when it's humid and hot, one should take a combination of Daohong powder and Xiehuang powder, or similar herbs like Huangqin, Ginseng, and Muxiang. After the autumn equinox, use Xiebai powder, and after the arrival of winter, use Rehmannia pills as a primary treatment, which is not subject to drainage. Haicang states that for Liver Nourishment Pills: within the Siwu Decoction, add Fengfeng and Qianghuo in equal parts, ground into a fine powder, and then formed into honey pills. For the Liver Calming Pills: Xieqing pills, excluding Gardenia and Rhubarb, are used to treat liver deficiency. For the Kidney Draining Pills: they target a full and strong pulse, namely the aforementioned Rehmannia pills, substituting freshly prepared Rehmannia instead of the cooked version, and excluding Corni fruits. This treats the pulse of the left wrist. If the right wrist pulse is strong and full, use Fengsui Dan to drain it. The Rehmannia pills mentioned are the same as the Eight Flavor Pills by Zhang Zhongjing, minus cinnamon and aconite. If added with Schisandra, it becomes the Kidney Qi Pills, which nourish the lung's source and generate kidney water."},{"anchor":"trans-55p","marker":"55p","type":"translation","text":"### Medical Connections Between the Organs The heart is connected to the tongue.

When the liver is ill, the skin becomes dark; the lung injures the liver, causing a deficiency of the metal element (geng and xin). When the spleen is ill, the lips turn cyan; the liver injures the spleen, resulting in deficiency of the wood element (jia and yi). When the lung is ill, the cheeks swell and the eyes turn red; the heart injures the lung, causing deficiency of the fire element (bing and ding). When the kidney is ill, the face swells and the lips turn yellow; the spleen injures the kidney, resulting in deficiency of the earth element (wu and ji). ### Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment Zhang Jiegugu stated: The five organs have a relationship of mother and child between deficiency and excess; the ghosts and thieves are subtle or apparent. If the intent is not reached, it becomes difficult to enter. The excess pathologies are in the front; the child can now cause the mother to be excessive, repelling the thieves that harm the mother. The child also calls for assistance from what the mother restrains, hence termed as excess pathology. The deficient pathologies are in the back; the mother brings the child’s ghost and thief, as the mother can cause the child to be deficient too. The Inner Canon states: The child can cause the mother to be excessive, and the mother can cause the child to be deficient. This is what it's referring to. When the wife comes to dominate the husband, that’s termed a subtle pathology; when the husband comes to dominate the wife, that’s termed a thieving pathology. The treatment should focus on dispelling the ghosts and nourishing the root organ. When the root organ itself is ill, this is the proper and improper pathology. If it’s deficient, then nourish it; if it’s excessive, then drain it. The classic states: To nourish the sprouts, one must secure the roots; to cut from the bottom, one must dry out the top. To reverse the roots and cut at the base will ruin the true essence."},{"anchor":"trans-57p","marker":"57p","type":"translation","text":"If the liver prevails over the lungs, it leads to liver disease, with body heat causing convulsions, and signs of lung deficiency appear. When one experiences wheezing and shortness of breath, and the illness manifests during the hours of Shen, You, or Xu, this indicates a strong liver. The classics say: to be constrained and yet unable to control is termed true strength. The appropriate treatment is to tonify the spleen and lungs while draining the liver, using Daohong San and Xie Huang San as primary remedies. Liu Zonghou pointed out that all of this relates to the five organs overcoming each other, with the pathological mechanisms closely tied to the principles of generation and overcoming in the five elements. Infants, upon first entering the swaddling, have not yet developed the seven emotions and six desires; they are merely physically fragile, with unsettled blood and qi, and their organ spirits are incomplete, leading to conditions of deficient and excessive organ energy. However, common practice often overlooks this principle, frequently attributing such cases to external pathogens or internal injuries and thus leading to many wrongful deaths. How tragic! The writings of the Qian family sometimes miss key points, yet fortunately, Jie Gu has supplemented them. Now, I have specifically added these discussions, which are truly of boundless benefit. **Methods of Supplementing and Draining the Five Organs** Qian said: Whenever there is an initial deficiency, or it has already descended, one must first treat the mother organ before draining the child organ. For example, if the lungs are deficient but phlegm is excessive, this is an indication for purging; one should first benefit the spleen and then proceed to drain the lungs. The Xie Qing Wan is also known as Xie Gan Wan."},{"anchor":"trans-58p","marker":"58p","type":"translation","text":"Qian states that there are no methods to nourish the liver, thus there are no liver-nourishing medicines. Wang Haizang made a refined honey pill from the Siwu Decoction, adding Fangfeng and Qianghuo, naming it the Liver Nourishing Pill. He also created the Zhen Gan Pill by removing Zhizi and Dahuang from the Xieqing Pill to treat liver deficiency. Daohong San disperses heat in the small intestine. Xiexin Decoction drains the heart. Anshen Wan treats heart deficiency with symptoms of heat, causing the spirit to be confused and disoriented. Haizang's Babushisan stabilizes the mind and is a proper heart tonic. Yihuang San, also known as Bupi San, is said by Haizang to tonify the spleen and dry dampness. Dongyuan notes it treats cold dampness in the stomach, nausea, abdominal pain, and is a holy medicine for diarrhea with clear discharge. Xiehuang San, also known as Xiepisan, is noted by Haizang to drain heat from the spleen. Ejiao San, also called Bulei San, as stated by Haizang, treats the lungs. Xingren primarily drains the lungs, unlike ginseng, Asparagus adscendens, or Ophiopogon japonicus. Xie Bai San, also named Xie Fei San, according to Haizang, addresses lung heat with symptoms of bone steaming and spontaneous sweating, directly draining this condition. Zhizi and Huangqin also drain the lungs, differentiating between qi and blood. Dihuang Wan is simply the Jinkui Eight Ingredients Pill without Gui and Fu. Haizang claims it treats kidney deficiency leading to headaches, particularly for sallow symptoms and the pulse being weak. Qian argues that there are no draining methods for the kidneys, hence no kidney-draining medicines. Haizang's Xie Shen Wan treats a full and robust pulse, similar to the prior Dihuang Wan, substituting Shudihuang for Shengdihuang and omitting Sanjue.

Hot feet dislike coverings, and heart fire descends to the kidneys, so root a Kidney Qi Pill or Zheng Qi Decoction. Moreover, if lung disease is heavy and follows with liver deficiency, it is easier to treat; if with liver heat, it is harder to treat. This is because prolonged lung disease leads to cold deficiency, while strong liver energy can dominate. The classics say: to be controlled and yet unable to control is called true strength. Thus, the method should be to nourish the spleen and lungs first, then drain the liver. When the lungs are dominant, it is necessary to nourish the liver and drain the lungs. However, in cases of chronic cough and deficiency, Xie Bai San should not be taken; the Kidney Qi Pill is more appropriate. The diseases of the five organs do not escape the principles of the five elements of generation and overcoming, leading to imbalances of deficiency and excess in the organs.

人皆曰肝常有余，脾常不足。予亦曰心常有余，肺常不足。有余为实，不足为虚。"},{"anchor":"orig-11p","marker":"11p","type":"original","text":"《内经》曰：邪气盛则实，真气夺则虚。此所谓有余不足者，非经云虚实之谓也。盖肝之有余者，肝属木，旺于春，春乃少阳之气，万物之所资以发生者也。儿之初生曰芽儿者，谓如草木之芽，受气初生，其气方盛，亦少阳之气方长而未已，故曰肝有余。有余者，乃阳自然有余也。脾常不足者，脾司土气，儿之初生，所饮食者乳耳，水谷未入，脾未用事，其气尚弱，故曰不足。不足者，乃谷气之自然不足也。心亦曰有余者，心属火，旺于夏，所谓壮火之气也。肾主虚者，此父母有生之后，禀气不足之谓也。肺亦不足者，肺为娇脏，难调而易伤也。脾肺皆属太阴，天地之寒热伤人也，感则肺先受之；水谷之寒热伤人也，盛则脾先受之。故曰脾肺皆不足。
