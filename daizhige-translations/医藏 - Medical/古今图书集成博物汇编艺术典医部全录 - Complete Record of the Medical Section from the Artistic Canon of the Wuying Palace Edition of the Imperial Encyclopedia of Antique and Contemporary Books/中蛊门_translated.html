<p><strong>The Door of Gu Poison</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Formulas</strong> [Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Gu poison comprises a thousand varieties, each differing: some may lead to bleeding; others prefer to lie in dark rooms, avoiding light; some experience erratic emotions, alternating between anger and joy; while others suffer from heavy limbs and aching joints. These varying symptoms are too numerous to detail. There are cases where individuals succumb after three years, while the urgent may die within a month or even a hundred days. Death occurs typically through the nine orifices, or from flesh under the ribs. Therefore, when leaving the house, it is crucial to carry realgar, musk, and other potent purgatives, as these will prevent a hundred types of gu, cat spirits, foxes, and ancient demonic entities from affecting a person. Those who cultivate health must be mindful of this.</p>
<p>There are also cautery methods in common use. Initially, when afflicted with gu, one should apply a large moxa burn beneath the heart area, with a hundred robust applications. This method also addresses cat spirits and can lead to recovery. Additionally, apply three strong moxa burns on the tip of the little toe. There should be a release of something; if from wine, it will be wine; if from rice, it will be rice; and if from meat and vegetables, those will emerge too, indicating successful treatment. All these should manifest from the moxa burn sores.</p>
<p>Generally, gu poison causes severe, cramping pain in the heart and abdomen, as if being gnawed by something; or results in vomiting blood, resembling rotten flesh. If not treated immediately, it will consume all five internal organs, leading to death. To test for it, request the patient to spit; if it sinks, it is gu poison; if it does not sink, it is not gu poison.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>In general, when a person suffers for many years and the abdomen becomes large, dark like lacquer, either hard or thin, or slightly red, this is due to poison (gu). When a person suddenly suffers from hematochezia and the condition worsens with treatment, this is also due to poison (gu). If someone suffers from bloody dysentery, whether red or black, in any amount, this is all the result of poison (gu). Crude doctors prescribe potions for dysentery, which is a major error. </p>
<p>In the world, there are unskillful doctors who, upon seeing a patient with abdominal swelling and an overall swollen body, neglect the condition of the limbs, observe the urine&#39;s quality, and treat it with water. They protract the treatment over more than fifty days, hoping for recovery, while the condition actually keeps worsening, leading to the patient&#39;s demise. Such cases are numerous. Learners should carefully investigate the principles and subtly apply them; they will not go wrong even once. There are thousands of texts in medicinal formulas, but these cannot all be fully elaborated.</p>
<p>When a person is afflicted by poison (gu), if someone used poison to harm them, knowing the name of the gu master when taking medicine can help call it away. If one wishes to know the gu master&#39;s name, one can burn the skin of a broken drum into powder and take it with a small drink. In a moment, one can call out the gu master&#39;s name and command it to leave, which will lead to recovery. There are also poisons made with snake venom that are mixed into food, causing severe ailments. These conditions, if accumulated over years, can lead to death, each requiring its own specific treatment.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>On Treating the Illness</strong>  </p>
<p>The scriptures describe several types of poisonous substances. In the mountainous regions of Guizhong, people create these using insects and snakes, storing them in vessels to let them consume each other. The one that survives is called &quot;gu.&quot; Its poison, when ingested in food or drink, can harm humans. If poisoned, one experiences intense abdominal pain as if being bitten by something, with symptoms including vomiting and blood that resembles rotting flesh. If not treated promptly, it can erode the five viscera, resulting in death. This illness varies in urgency; acute cases may lead to death within ten days or so, while chronic cases can drag on for years, causing internal turmoil and weakness, leading to a heaviness in the bones and a restless heart, while the patient&#39;s food also transforms into &quot;gu,&quot; slowly consuming the internal organs until death ensues. Upon death, the illness can spread to others, becoming a contagion. To identify it, one can test the patient&#39;s saliva; if it sinks, it is &quot;gu,&quot; if it floats, it is not. Alternatively, one can have the patient hold a large soybean; if the skin of the soybean swells and ruptures, it indicates &quot;gu,&quot; if it remains intact, then it is not. Placing a swan&#39;s skin under the patient while keeping them unaware can also help; if the condition worsens, it suggests &quot;gu,&quot; whereas if it does not worsen, it implies otherwise. The treatment method should not mimic the treatment of other ailments and must be conducted with careful examination. In ancient practices, the charred skin of a drum was burnt to ash and mixed with medicinal rice concocted to be consumed in small doses, often calling out the names of those associated with &quot;gu&quot; to ensure recovery. In any case of poisoning, chewing raw black beans without any foul taste and consuming sweet white alum indicates poisoning.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Medical Treatise</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Poisoning</strong></p>
<p>In the mountainous areas of Liangguang, people collect various creatures like snakes, centipedes, slugs, and toads in a container, allowing them to devour each other. The winner is then worshipped as a spirit. They extract the poison and mix it with vegetables, fruits, and food to harm others, absurdly hoping for blessings and wealth. Some people become afflicted by this, experiencing countless symptoms, and many die over the years. There are also families that offer incense and sacrifices to their ancestors, calling it a curse, which can also cause illness; this is referred to by the world as a &quot;gu&quot; sickness. Because these are linked to the five sounds, they are termed the &quot;five gu.&quot; Such practices are common in remote border areas, but are rarely heard of in the central capitals.</p>
<p>The effects of gu poison cause severe abdominal and heart pain, as if something is being vomited out, and it feels like rotten flesh. If not treated immediately, it can consume the five internal organs and lead to death. Those afflicted may show symptoms of their saliva sinking when tested, indicating the presence of poison.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>There are those who use poison to harm others; if one wishes to know the name of the poisoner, one must burn the skin of a defeated drum into powder and drink it with a small dagger. After a moment, the name of the poisoner will be revealed. Command them to call out the name, and they will recover. There are also methods for treatment.</p>
<p>To test for poison, hold a large soybean; if the soybean swells and the skin splits, it indicates poison. If it does not swell and the skin does not split, it indicates otherwise. Furthermore, place a swan&#39;s skin beneath where the patient lies, taking care they do not notice it. If the illness is severe, this confirms poison; if not, it indicates otherwise. </p>
<p>Treatment must be careful and thorough, tested before proceeding. Nowadays, some people mistakenly believe they have poison if they experience bloating, which is especially erroneous. </p>
<p>Among poisons, some act quickly, causing death within days; others are slow, taking years, leading to weakness and eventual death after draining the organs. Once dead, their poison can infect others, causing a similar affliction.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>If confirmed as poison, one should quickly take the Qianjin Golden Tooth Powder or the Supreme Five Poison Pill, or the Jisheng Danhua Pill. </p>
<p>When a person is harmed by various poisons, a floating and rapid pulse indicates survival, while a faint pulse leads to death; a strong and slow pulse indicates survival. </p>
<p>For snake poison, if obtained through food, one feels as if something is stuck in the throat, cannot swallow or spit it out, and experiences a restless, heated feeling in the heart. Taking Aristolochia can help purge it; additionally, taking one penny&#39;s weight of musk helps expel the poison. Most poisons are often disguised toxic substances that are administered. </p>
<p>At the right time, one should boil soybeans and licorice, and drink the juice of watercress to clear all poisons. </p>
<p>For mountain bean root, regardless of the amount, if containing poison, finely grind it with water in a discreet manner and take a small quantity while keeping quiet, without taking more afterwards; alternatively, mix it with two pennies of alcohol. </p>
<p>If poison is in the food, it can cause severe internal pain, yellowish-green eyes, and a sensation of bone exposure; the illness evolves erratically.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Grind chicken liver with iron to a fine powder and shape it into pills the size of a tung seed. Take five pills with wine before or after meals. </p>
<p>Detoxification pills are used to treat poisoning from mistaken ingestion of toxins and other harmful substances, saving a person from certain death. </p>
<p>Qingdai Xionghuang pills: whenever one first feels poisoned, or after being bitten by snakes or insects, or when boils and sores just begin to form, take these immediately to prevent the accumulation of toxic gas. </p>
<p>Detoxification pills: effective for treating all forms of undissipated heat in men, women, and children. They address stagnant toxins, heat in the upper jiao, throat issues, excessive dryness and thirst, summer heat causing discomfort, and unsettled cholera; they also counter mountain miasmas, food and wine toxins, uncontrollable vomiting, and wandering pathogens causing confusion and obscuring consciousness, leading to restlessness and red eyes with sores in the mouth. </p>
<p>They are particularly good for relieving seasonal colds and spreading pandemic toxins, as well as any toxins from unfamiliar lands and water. Regular use of this medicine strengthens the vital essence, enhances energy, transforms toxins, dispels wind, and its divine efficacy is beyond detailed description.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Secret Records of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>By Chen Shiduo (Qing Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bewitchment of the Golden Silkworm</strong></p>
<p>There exists a poison of the golden silkworm, such as that found between the two Yuè regions where people keep them in their homes, using schemes to send them away but they do not depart. Initially, there was a method of marrying the golden silkworm; if a family comes into contact with this silkworm, then from generation to generation, they will never be free from it, making it a most detestable thing. It is said that a spirit causes mischief, attaching itself to this family and refusing to leave. If there are those in the household who wish it gone, they will wrap all of their worldly possessions along with the golden silkworm, intentionally placing them by the roadside. If someone unaware of the reason picks them up and takes them home, the golden silkworm will attach itself to the person and cannot be removed. Even repeated prayers and offerings will not suffice. One must take three qian of thunderbolts powdered into fine dust, mixing it with a small amount of white alum. Should the golden silkworm appear, one should sprinkle a small amount of this powder onto the body of the worm, which will immediately transform into red water like blood. The spirit will certainly be enraged and cause trouble. Should there be a sound in the air, one must listen to where the sound is loudest and sprinkle the powder into the sky; thus, the spirit will curse the ungrateful and depart, never to return. At the time of encountering the object, one will inevitably become suddenly wealthy, as objects fall from the sky. The person will be exceedingly joyous and will honor the golden silkworm in the cabinet, praying to it morning and evening. After a while, the person&#39;s face will turn golden, resembling the golden silkworm. If the medicine is ineffective, and after a long time, their abdomen will swell up like a drum. At that time, this trend was rampant in Shu, where those who obtained a golden silkworm often could not escape death within five years, and the golden silkworm would not depart, frequently leading to the destruction of the entire household.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Formula for Great Gold Tooth Powder</strong></p>

Wear it to repel all evils and treat ninety-nine types of ailments. One version includes musk and omits white atractylodes.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The Great Sage’s Five Worms</p>
<p>To treat the myriad of worms that cause blood vomiting and internal injuries, leading to a firm obstruction in the heart and abdomen, where speech cannot emerge from the throat, shortness of breath causes a desire to die, inability to eat or drink, regurgitation of upward energy, with erratic comings and goings, resembling a ghostly presence, bodily swelling, heart oppression, annoyance and pain, chills and shaking, dreams of encounters with spirits, seductive foxes, and ultimately heartache that pierces the chest and sides as if stabbed by a knife, lasting for years, bedridden and unable to rise, all are governed by this.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Realgar, Muxiang, Bami, Mangcao, Yuanhua, Guijiao (also known as Muxiang), Zhenzhu (also known as Muxiang), Alums (sulphate of alum), Liluh each four parts; Fuzi five parts; Otter liver one part; two Centipedes; thirty Scorpions. </p>
<p>Mix these thirteen ingredients into a powder, blend with honey, and further pound for two thousand strikes, forming pills the size of small beans. Take one pill before eating or drinking. The remainder should be sealed tightly to prevent the escape of medicinal vapors. Ten pills constitute one dose. If the illness does not subside, increase by one pill on subsequent days, observing the effect. </p>
<p>Regarding the worms, there are countless manifestations that cannot be fully described. After administering, rest for seven days, then take one dose; after thirty years, all ailments will be eliminated. Avoid five pungent substances.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>The Great Unity Pursuit of Orders is effective for treating various ailments. If one is afflicted by malevolent Qi, experiencing abdominal fullness, difficulty breathing, heart pain, accumulation, swelling, hernias, undigested food, vomiting, chills and fevers, scrofula, poison, or lingering ailments after childbirth: </p>
<p>Take one centipede, one part cinnabar, one part aconite, one part alum (also called crystal stone), one part realgar, one part rhizome of corydalis, one part ghost gourd, and two parts croton seed. </p>
<p>Grind these eight ingredients into a powder, mix with honey to form pills the size of hemp seeds. Take two pills at a time, once daily. For typhus, take one pill after one or two days; once sweating begins, wrap the two pills in cotton and plug them into both ears. For dysentery, take one pill and insert another into the lower region. For poison, take two pills; externally, grind them into a paste and apply to the affected area; if there is nausea, it will help cooking it from within and relieve diarrhea. </p>
<p>For sores, apply one pill to draw out the poison. For lingering ailments after childbirth, take one pill. For deafness, wrap and plug your ears. </p>
<p>Additionally, there is another method for treating someone who has been afflicted with medicinal mixtures and poison.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The text describes the preparation of a traditional medicinal formula for treating various ailments. The ingredients include certain herbs and animals, with specific dosages and preparation methods outlined. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Various small plants and herbs, as well as the skin of a ram. </li>
<li>The formulas require precise measurements, including four liang of certain herbs and three centipedes.</li>

<li>The text also mentions accompanying the medicine with a warm porridge for nourishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Indications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is indicated for &quot;gu&quot; poison (a form of malady believed to be caused by sorcery), characterized by symptoms like swollen limbs and other distressing signs such as a distended abdomen.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Substitutions</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>It notes variations in ingredients depending on availability, indicating adjustments with alternative herbs when certain ones are not at hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the text provides a detailed traditional medicinal recipe targeting severe malaises attributed to &quot;gu&quot; poison and the effects thereof.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Rhino horn powder treats poison and ailments, including violent abdominal pain, flying corpses, foul gas, and swelling. </p>
<p>Rhino horn shavings, ghost vine shavings, cinnamon powder, and antelope horn shavings, each four qian; Tianxiong, wild grass, true pearl, and realgar, each one liang; five segments of centipede and five pieces of shell, are to be burned. </p>
<p>Mix one egg-sized amount of &quot;She Wang&quot; (a specific herb) and two fen of musk. According to &quot;Qian Jin,&quot; volume twenty-four on poisonous treatments. </p>
<p>Fifty seeds of ba dou. The thirteen ingredients on the right should be ground and mixed; form pills the size of small beans, taking one pill twice daily. Hold in the mouth and swallow, adjusting as needed. </p>
<p>In case of a swollen abdomen caused by flying corpses, take two pills about the size of large beans. If there is foul-smelling swelling, mix with bitter wine and apply it, enclosing the herbal medicine in a pouch tied to the left arm to ward off evil, ghosts, and poisonous ailments, which can be used for emergencies. </p>
<p>Another recipe follows.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Great Diarrhea</strong>: The use of <em>Chanmao</em> [<em>Chanmao</em>: According to &quot;Qianjin&quot; Volume Twenty-Four, the dosage is one part.] On the fifth day of the fifth month, take four parts of peach white skin each. </p>
<p>Take these three ingredients, prepare them by sifting, and take them on an empty stomach in the morning with about one chicken egg&#39;s worth of water, in eight pinches, using two fingers touching as if to open. Take it all at once. If the fingers are apart, too much medicine has been taken, which could harm the person.</p>
<p><strong>Another formula</strong>: For treating internal poison causing bloody stool, occurring tens of times daily. </p>
<p>Take two to seven seeds of <em>Bodhi</em>, <em>Yuanqing</em>, <em>Li Lu</em>, <em>Fu Zi</em>, and <em>Alunite</em>, each two parts. Grind these five ingredients into powder, separately prepare the <em>Bodhi</em>, combine them, and wrap the medicine with cotton to the size of a soybean, inserting it into the lower part, three times a day, to recover. </p>
<p><strong>Another formula</strong>: For treating bloody stools that appear like chicken liver, with unbearable pain in the abdomen. </p>

Someone who had been beaten and suffered internal bleeding and bruising, lying down for nine years, took medicine for thirteen days, expelled two to three pints of black blood, and was healed. A person deaf for seventeen years took medicine for thirty-five days, bled out three pints from the nose, and expelled five pints of yellow fluid from the ear, thus recovering. The ancient texts say: In the second year of Xiping, the governor of the northern region, Chen Guang, affirmed this, noting the efficacy against poisonous curses; those afflicted by such poisons were healed with no exception after taking the medicine. Those with difficult recoveries took no more than twenty-seven days, and all achieved results fully. There was a woman, over forty years old, who was emaciated and unable to rise, having lain in bed for three years, deaf and hearing nothing, with hands that could not move.

<p><strong>&quot;Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Cabinet&quot;</strong> – [Authored by Zhang Ji from the Han Dynasty]</p>
<p><strong>Taboos from Animals, Fish, and Insects</strong><a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>All food and flavors serve to nourish life. If food is harmful, it can cause injury. Unless one resorts to medicinal concoctions, how can one avoid eating? It is evident that people now do not regulate their diets, and illness arises rapidly, as if not caused by food. To preserve one’s life, one must know what to avoid. Some foods are compatible with health, while others are harmful to the body. If one eats what is suitable, it enhances the body; if detrimental, it leads to illness, which can result in danger that is often difficult to remedy. </p>
<p>When preparing medicinal decoctions to detoxify, even if it is said to be an emergency remedy, one should not consume them hot; poisons worsen with heat, so it is better to drink them cold. Liver diseases should avoid pungent foods, heart diseases should avoid salty foods, spleen diseases should avoid sour foods, lung diseases should avoid bitter foods, and kidney diseases should avoid sweet foods. In spring, do not eat foods that affect the liver; in summer, do not eat foods affecting the heart; in autumn, do not eat foods affecting the lungs; in winter, do not eat those affecting the kidneys; and throughout the four seasons, avoid foods that harm the spleen.</p>
<p>It is explained: in spring, one should not eat liver because the liver is dominant, and the spleen is weakened; eating liver would further nourish the liver and exacerbate the spleen’s weakness, making it irreparable. Moreover, when the liver is dominant, one must not introduce stale energy into it, for this could harm the spirit. If it is not the time of dominance, then when it is deficient, nourishing the liver is beneficial. The same applies to the other organs.</p>
<p>One should not eat the liver lightly; if it dies, it is even more critical. The heart, being the seat of consciousness, should not be consumed, so that one can repay their past in the next life. Any meat or liver that falls to the ground without touching dust should not be eaten. Pork that floats in water should not be consumed. All meats and fish, if not eaten by dogs or pecked by birds, should not be eaten. Any meat that is not dried, or moves when roasted over fire, or moves in water should not be consumed.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Meat that has red spots like vermilion should not be eaten. The meat of livestock with continuously flowing hot blood should not be consumed. Eating the flesh of one’s parents or vital life source causes unrest in the spirit and soul.

Rotten rice, spoiled meat, and stinky fish harm the body if consumed. Meat from animals that died on their own with their mouths closed should not be eaten. Meat from livestock that died naturally or from disease is toxic and should not be consumed. Animals that died spontaneously with their heads facing north or lying on the ground can kill if eaten. Eating raw meat and drinking milk to satiety turns into white worms. Eating the meat of cattle that died from disease leads to illness and can cause hard accumulations in the body, requiring purgative medicine. Dried meat stored in rice pots may be toxic, and eating it after summer can lead to kidney disease.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Horses with no night eyes on their hooves should not be eaten. Eating sour horse meat and not drinking alcohol can lead to death. Horse meat should not be eaten hot, as it harms the heart. Meat from under the saddle is lethal when consumed. White horses with black heads should not be eaten. White horses with green hooves should not be eaten. Eating horse meat with pork and becoming overly full can lead to serious problems. Mixing donkey or horse meat with pork results in dysentery. Horse liver and hair should not be carelessly consumed, as they can poison and harm. Cattle that die from disease, showing red or yellow eyes, should not be eaten, as it is a serious prohibition. Eating beef and pork together will certainly lead to white worms. Beef intestines should not be cooked with dog meat. Beef lungs from March to May may contain worms like horse tails; they should be removed and not eaten, as consuming them can cause harm. Beef, mutton, and pork should not be steamed or grilled with paper mulberry or mulberry wood, as it leads to the generation of worms in the stomach.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Eating snake and beef is deadly; how can one know this? Those who eat snake, if their hair stands on end, are affected. Mutton with residual heat should not be consumed. Mutton should not be eaten with fish and cheese, as it harms people. The white beads found in sheep hooves, known as &quot;sheep hanging tendons,&quot; cause madness if eaten. A white sheep with a black head, if its brain is consumed, causes intestinal abscesses. Eating lamb liver with peppers harms the internal organs. Pork combined with lamb liver causes heart discomfort. Eating raw cilantro with pork causes umbilical rot. Pig fat should not be eaten with plums. Pork and sunflower should be avoided together, as it reduces energy. Deer meat should not be made into soup with wild arum, as it causes sores. Eating elk fat and plums can cause pregnant women to give birth to boys who are blue-eyed and blind, and harm men&#39;s vitality.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>The meat of deer should not be consumed with shrimp, raw vegetables, plums, or other fruits, as it can harm patients. Those with chronic illnesses should avoid bear meat, as it prevents recovery for life. Meat from a white dog that has died without sticking out its tongue is harmful to people. Eating the leftovers of dogs and rats can cause skin diseases. Pregnant women should not eat rabbit meat, goat meat, or the meat of turtles, chickens, and ducks, as it can cause the child to be mute. Rabbit meat should not be eaten with white chicken meat, as it can cause yellowing of the face. Rabbit meat cooked with dried ginger can lead to cholera. Any bird that has died with its mouth open and wings spread should not be consumed. The liver of various birds that appears green can be fatal. Chickens with six flight feathers and four spurs should not be eaten. Black chickens with white heads should not be consumed. Chicken should not be eaten with garlic, as it causes stagnation.

<p><strong>On the Poisons in Food and Drink</strong></p>
<p>Animals that die of natural causes are all poisonous and should not be eaten. Fish without gills are poisonous, and those with large gills are also poisonous. Turtles with red algae patterns on their bellies are poisonous. Crabs with hair on their bellies are poisonous. Wine that is just boiled and then removed from the heat is poisonous; in Jiangnan, this is called &quot;firehead wine,&quot; and drinking it can cause hemorrhoids and bleeding. During summer months, any food that has been left overnight is poisonous. Wine left overnight in copper or tin vessels becomes poisonous. When food is heated in copper, the vapor rises and condenses into droplets that fall into the food, making it poisonous. Soup that has been left overnight can be poisonous; washing it can lead to scabies. The double almonds of peaches and apricots are deadly poisonous. Fruits that haven&#39;t yet formed pits are all poisonous and can cause sores and boils. In summer and autumn, fruits that fall to the ground and are infested with worms are poisonous, causing leakage when consumed. Rainwater that leaks into a house is poisonous; consuming it can cause bloating and even death, and using it for washing hands can lead to scabies, as repeatedly observed. Stagnant water in marshes is poisonous; drinking it can result in abdominal tumors. Hot spring water in baths should not be drunk, as it causes bloating and discomfort; it is only suitable for bathing to relieve skin ailments, since the springs are sourced from sulfur, thus warm. Those suffering from skin issues should eat well before bathing for several days in a row to sweat it out and heal. Individuals with weak constitutions should avoid bathing lightly.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Stones</strong> by Sun Simiao</p>
<p>People who do not take the stones suffer from various ailments; skin diseases and fevers persist yearly, causing distress in their food and sleep, and their living conditions remain unpleasant. This issue not only affects their health but also complicates childbirth. The presence of stones in the body leads to universal troubles and emphasizes the importance of not taking the Five Stones. </p>
<p>Individuals over thirty may take stone medicine; however, if they are naturally robust, they should not take it recklessly. Those over forty must take it. For those over fifty, they may take a dose every three years; for those over sixty, every two years; and for those over seventy, once a year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is stated that those over fifty have diminished vitality, and taking stones can still be beneficial. Yet, for those over sixty, such consumption may lead to adverse effects. Therefore, regular consumption of stones keeps the hands and feet warm, vitalizes the marrow, dispels cold, and improves agility, allowing them to withstand extremes of heat and cold without succumbing to various illnesses; hence the importance of regular intake.</p>
<p>All stones used must be thoroughly refined. If any symptoms arise, they typically manifest as cold-induced headaches or heart discomfort, occurring periodically like intermittent fevers. If such signs appear, do not excessively take cold water but remedy it with warmth, ensuring that all foods are warm, except for wine.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>It is further said: One must never mix various foods when consuming stone substances. Even if there are a hundred delicacies laid out, do not indulge heavily in the flesh. If mixed too richly, there will inevitably be mutual harm, causing accumulation that does not dissipate, thereby disturbing the stones. If one holds their heart as prescribed, they will achieve what they seek; stone medicine is beneficial, and goodness cannot be enhanced. </p>
<p>In my thirty-eighth or thirty-ninth year, I regularly consumed five to six taels of milk, and since then, I have deeply understood this matter. As for rest and moderation, I have considerable insight into their essence. Those who cultivate health should pay careful attention to this! However, the milk stones must come from clean, pure, and smooth land, with patterns resembling bird feathers; everything must be entirely white to be consumed. As for those not from such land, one should be cautious and avoid them. Many can be deadly, even more so than poison. </p>
<p>Purple stones and white stones must reflect both internally and externally, being clear and bright. If not, they should also not be consumed. The five stones of cold stone are a new formula; this method has been said to not have been known by ancient sages. None among the feudal lords of the Han dynasty have used it. Since the time of the scholar Huanfu Shian, there have been those introducing such potions, yet none have ended well, facing overthrow and collapse. </p>
<p>Since I have become discerning, I have personally witnessed officials from all ranks suffering various fates. Thus, I would prefer to eat wild kudzu rather than take the five stones. It is evident that it is extremely toxic, and one must be cautious! Wise individuals encountering this formula should immediately burn it and not leave it unattended!<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>On Neutralizing the Poisons of a Hundred Herbs</strong></p>
<p>Licorice neutralizes the poisons of a hundred herbs; this is truly like pouring hot water on snow, and bears a similar mystical quality. If someone is poisoned by aconite or calabash seeds, licorice in the stomach will settle the situation immediately. For those poisoned by rhubarb, swallowing onion soup can quickly remedy it. If one is poisoned by wild yam, simply drinking a mixture of soil and water will stop the effects. Such matters are as clear as turning one&#39;s hand over; they should be widely known. Yet, few are willing to learn them, which is truly lamentable. </p>
<p>Soy bean juice is also said to neutralize the poisons of a hundred herbs. In my experience, it is quite limited compared to licorice. Furthermore, it can be enhanced to make a sweet bean soup, yielding even more remarkable results. For someone who takes Jade Pot Pill and vomits uncontrollably, no medicine can stop it, but blue juice taken will immediately resolve the issue. Such knowledge should be recognized. These are established rules, no further experimentation is necessary.</p>
<p>In the realm of antidotes, there are countless regulations; if one does not specify a few, learners cannot fully comprehend. I am merely providing examples: For stone poison, use white duck excrement and ginseng juice. For arsenic poison, use fibrous roots. For iron powder poison, use magnet. For talc poison, administer soy bean juice and white goose bone. For防葵 poison, apply root juice of sunflower. For euphorbia poison, use calamus juice. For balloon flower poison, use white porridge. For cassia seed poison, utilize soy bean juice. (Unclear term) poison, treat with gardenia juice. Chicken egg poison can be neutralized with pure vinegar. For sword grass poison, use clear water. For wild yam poison, employ soil and fecal juice. For apricot kernel poison, take blue juice. The poisons of a hundred herbs can be neutralized with licorice, hyssop, and the juices of large and small beans, and blue leaf root.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Gold and silver poison can be expelled with several taels of mercury. The juice of chicken embryos and their excrement can be mixed with pig fat and taken. Water steeped in chicken excrement and scallion juice can also be boiled. </p>
<p>For the poison of Chinese wild celery, use Stephania, windbreaker, licorice, and cinnamon juice. The poison from wild kudzu requires the clear juice of chicken eggs, kudzu root juice, licorice juice, the hot blood of duck heads, pig fat, chicken feces, and human feces. </p>
<p>For the poison of rhubarb, boil it in warm water with scallion juice. The poisons from Aconitum, Tianxiong, and Fuzi can be treated with soybean juice, Polygala, windbreaker, jujube meat, and syrup. </p>
<p>The poisonous effects of the &quot;shé wǎng&quot; can be countered with indigo juice, the juices of large and small beans, bamboo juice, hemp seed juice, lotus root juice, the blood of livestock, shell teeth fragments, and earthworm excrement. </p>
<p>For the poison of pinellia, use fresh ginger juice and boiled dried ginger juice. The poison from the plant &quot;láng dāng&quot; can be countered with cress, licorice, rhinoceros horn, crab juice, and rhubarb. </p>
<p>For the poison of wolf venom, use almonds, indigo juice, white poppy, salt juice, and wood ear fungus. The poison from physic nut can be treated with boiled Huanglian juice, soybean juice, acorus juice, and fresh herbs. </p>
<p>Boil with cold water stone juice. The poison from Sichuan pepper can be handled with sunflower seed juice, garlic and cinnamon juice, fermented bean juice, human urine, cold water, and earth paste. Smoke burned chicken feathers and adjust with water for consumption. </p>
<p>For the poison from blister beetles and wild celery, use pig fat, soybean juice, Ruyu salt, indigo juice, and salt broth boiled with pig fat and physic nut. </p>
<p>For those who have taken an overdose of medicine, mix water with starch, water with kudzu powder, earth paste, the juice of a plantain, polished rice rinse, fermented beans, dried ginger, Huanglian, syrup, drink indigo juice, and swallow chicken egg yolk.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Jingyue Complete Book</strong> (Ming, Zhang Jiebin)</p>
<p><strong>Resolving All Food Toxins</strong></p>
<p>Sesame oil can effectively resolve all food toxins, which should not be overlooked. When preparing dishes, one must first use pure sesame oil in a clean pot to cook until fully heated, then add the meat to stir-fry, and finally, boil it in clean water; this method does not breach any toxicity. In regions like Huizhou and Chizhou, people eat beef daily without regard to spring or summer, primarily due to the proper preparation methods, which results in very few cases of poisoning. For those affected by food toxins, simply drinking one or two cups of sesame oil often induces vomiting and dispels the toxins, leading to recovery in all cases. The best antidote is fire, as fire can transform the properties of substances.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p>
<h3>Resolving All Poisons</h3>
<p>For resolving various medicinal poisons, it is advisable to use juices from shepherd&#39;s purse, white hyacinth bean, cowpea, licorice, syrup, rice syrup, and ashes from burnt silkworm paper; all can be used indiscriminately. Generally, antidote decoctions should not be taken hot; they should be consumed cool, for heat intensifies the power of the poison. However, this specifically applies to heat poisons. When resolving poisons such as those from the wood peach, fungi, coptis, or gypsum, which correspond to the cold yin poison, must one still avoid heat and instead consume cold drinks?</p>
<h3>Withstanding Arsenic Poison</h3>
<p>In the world, those who ingest arsenic poison suffer from excruciating pain in their organs, a distended abdomen, protruding tongues, and bleeding eyes leading to death—truly pitiful. The remedy is to use the detoxifying divine pill: two taels of rhubarb, five qian of raw licorice, one tael of alum, and three taels of angelica, boiled in water to make a decoction. Drink several bowls quickly, which will lead to a great purging; otherwise, death will ensue. Once the arsenic has entered the organs, it cannot simply be expelled by sheep&#39;s blood or raw licorice. That&#39;s why I have created a different method for salvation. If one drinks it without purging, the intestines are already ruptured, and what can be done? However, if used promptly, there is no case of death; one should not rigidly follow the vomiting method without flexibility. If one has just ingested arsenic, it is best to use three taels of raw licorice, urgently prepare a decoction with half a bowl of sheep&#39;s blood, mix it well, and drink it for immediate vomiting and recovery. If vomiting does not occur, use the rhubarb remedy quickly, and there’s no reason it cannot be saved.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Formula</strong></p>
<p>The Clean Ancient Detox Pill is effective in treating all accumulated heat that does not resolve in men, women, and children. This includes conditions such as upper burner congestion and heat, throat discomfort, dry mouth with excessive thirst, summer heat distress, persistent diarrhea, and instability from food or alcohol poisoning. It also addresses symptoms from miasmas, heat disease from different seasons, and any local toxins that people cannot tolerate. Regular use helps replenish true energy, transform toxins, and dispel wind, with remarkable effects that are hard to describe in detail.</p>

<p>These should be finely ground into a powder and formed into pills the size of a marble. Each dose consists of one pill taken with freshly drawn water, chewed thoroughly or dissolved in the mouth. For children, half a pill is sufficient. If women experience poor blood circulation, they may take one pill ground in ginger and peppermint water.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>Detox Pill: Resolves all unforeseen poisons in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Shen Xian San</strong> (Divine Immortal Powder) or <strong>Ya Shu Dan</strong> (Jade Pivot Pill); also known as <strong>Zi Jin Ding</strong> (Purple Gold Tablet): This treats all types of drug poisons, mushroom toxins, mouse toxin, harmful fungi, mineral poisons, toxins from eating plague-infested cattle and horse meat, pufferfish poison, seasonal epidemics, malaria, sudden throat closings, spleen diseases leading to jaundice, red eye sores, overheating, and fiery toxins. It is also suitable for those who choke, drown, have injuries from falls, or suffer from unburst boils, fish belly ulcers, burns from hot water or fire, and bites from centipedes, dogs, or snakes. It assists both men and women suffering from madness or ghostly energies. Everyone, whether at home or away, should not be without this medicine, as it is a true treasure for public welfare and family health. In areas with abundant toxins, like Lingnan, if one feels unwell, taking this immediately will provide relief.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>In the valley of Erguang Mountain, there is a plant called Hu Man Grass, also known as the Heartbreak Grass. If a person swallows it with hot water, they die instantly; if with lukewarm water, they die slowly. If one takes a poisonous snake and kills it, covers it with this grass, and sprinkles water on it, after several days, mushrooms will grow on it. This can be ground into powder and mixed with wine to poison someone. At first, there are no symptoms, but upon drinking more wine, the poison will immediately take effect and cause death.</p>
<p>It is customary for promiscuous women to often form unions with men from the north, establishing feelings with them but many are reluctant to chase them away. They secretly put medicine into food, and when the northern men return, they say: &quot;Your friend has come;&quot; if the men follow these words, they will be cured with an antidote. However, if they delay and do not leave, they will die—this is called the Scheduled Year Medicine. </p>
<p>When a northern man arrives, he should take note of this. If he feels poisoned, with the four bodily elements out of balance, he should take this medicine immediately; or if poison is placed in meat such as chicken, pork, fish, sheep, goose, or duck, consuming this will trigger the poison. Taking one grain of this medicine urgently will result in either vomiting or diarrhea, and he will recover immediately.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a woman who had been suffering from tuberculosis for a long time, eaten by corpse insects. She ground one grain of this medicine and after a while, expelled over a thousand small worms, with one large one being in two segments.

<p>　　甘草解百药毒，此实如汤沃雪，有同神妙。有人中乌头、巴豆毒，甘草入腹即定。中藜芦毒，葱汤下咽便愈中野葛毒，土浆饮讫即止。如此之事，其验如反掌，要使人皆知之。然人皆不肯学，诚可叹息。方称大豆汁解百药毒，余每试之，大悬绝，不及甘草。又能加之为甘豆汤，其验尤奇。有人服玉壶丸，致呕不能已，百药与之不止，蓝汁入口即定。如此之事，皆须知之。此则成规，更不须试练也。解毒方中，条例极多，若不指出一二，学者不可卒知，余方例尔。石药毒，用白鸭屎、人参汁。雄黄毒，用防己。铁粉毒，用磁石。礜石毒，用大豆汁、白鹅骨。防葵毒，用葵根汁。大戟毒，用菖蒲汁。桔梗毒，用白粥。甘遂毒，用大豆汁。(艹蹢)(艹躅)毒，用栀子汁。鸡子毒，用淳酢。马刀毒，用清水。野芋毒，用土浆、人粪汁。杏仁毒，用蓝子汁。百药毒，用甘草、荠苨、大小豆汁、蓝叶根实汁。<a id="orig-44p" href="#trans-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>金银毒，用水银服数两即出；鸡子汁及屎白，烧猪脂和服；水淋鸡屎汁煮葱汁。芫花毒，用防己、防风、甘草、桂汁。野葛毒，用鸡子清、葛根汁、甘草汁、鸭头热血、猪膏、鸡屎、人屎。藜芦毒，用雄黄温汤煮葱汁。乌头、天雄、附子毒，用大豆汁、远志、防风、枣肉、饴糖。射罔毒，用蓝汁、大小豆汁、竹沥、大麻子汁、藕芰汁、六畜血、贝齿屑、蚯蚓屎。半夏毒，用生姜汁及煮干姜汁。莨菪毒，用荠苨、甘草、犀角、蟹汁、升麻。狼毒毒，用杏仁、蓝汁、白蔹、盐汁、木占斯。巴豆毒，用煮黄连汁、大豆汁、菖蒲汁、生藿汁【《肘后》云小豆藿。】 煮寒水石汁。蜀椒毒，用葵子汁、蒜桂汁、豉汁、人尿、冷水、土浆；鸡毛烧吸烟及调水服。斑蝥、芫青毒，用猪膏、大豆汁、戎盐、蓝汁、盐汤煮猪膏、巴豆。服药过剂闷乱者，用水和胡粉、水和葛粉、地浆、蘘荷汁、粳米渖、豉汁、干姜、黄连、饴糖、饮蓝汁、吞鸡子黄。<a id="orig-45p" href="#trans-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>　　　　景岳全书 【明　张介宾】</p>

<p><strong>The Door of Gu Poison</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Formulas</strong> [Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Gu poison comprises a thousand varieties, each differing: some may lead to bleeding; others prefer to lie in dark rooms, avoiding light; some experience erratic emotions, alternating between anger and joy; while others suffer from heavy limbs and aching joints. These varying symptoms are too numerous to detail. There are cases where individuals succumb after three years, while the urgent may die within a month or even a hundred days. Death occurs typically through the nine orifices, or from flesh under the ribs. Therefore, when leaving the house, it is crucial to carry realgar, musk, and other potent purgatives, as these will prevent a hundred types of gu, cat spirits, foxes, and ancient demonic entities from affecting a person. Those who cultivate health must be mindful of this.</p>
<p>There are also cautery methods in common use. Initially, when afflicted with gu, one should apply a large moxa burn beneath the heart area, with a hundred robust applications. This method also addresses cat spirits and can lead to recovery. Additionally, apply three strong moxa burns on the tip of the little toe. There should be a release of something; if from wine, it will be wine; if from rice, it will be rice; and if from meat and vegetables, those will emerge too, indicating successful treatment. All these should manifest from the moxa burn sores.</p>
<p>Generally, gu poison causes severe, cramping pain in the heart and abdomen, as if being gnawed by something; or results in vomiting blood, resembling rotten flesh. If not treated immediately, it will consume all five internal organs, leading to death. To test for it, request the patient to spit; if it sinks, it is gu poison; if it does not sink, it is not gu poison.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In general, when a person suffers for many years and the abdomen becomes large, dark like lacquer, either hard or thin, or slightly red, this is due to poison (gu). When a person suddenly suffers from hematochezia and the condition worsens with treatment, this is also due to poison (gu). If someone suffers from bloody dysentery, whether red or black, in any amount, this is all the result of poison (gu). Crude doctors prescribe potions for dysentery, which is a major error. </p>
<p>In the world, there are unskillful doctors who, upon seeing a patient with abdominal swelling and an overall swollen body, neglect the condition of the limbs, observe the urine&#39;s quality, and treat it with water. They protract the treatment over more than fifty days, hoping for recovery, while the condition actually keeps worsening, leading to the patient&#39;s demise. Such cases are numerous. Learners should carefully investigate the principles and subtly apply them; they will not go wrong even once. There are thousands of texts in medicinal formulas, but these cannot all be fully elaborated.</p>
<p>When a person is afflicted by poison (gu), if someone used poison to harm them, knowing the name of the gu master when taking medicine can help call it away. If one wishes to know the gu master&#39;s name, one can burn the skin of a broken drum into powder and take it with a small drink. In a moment, one can call out the gu master&#39;s name and command it to leave, which will lead to recovery. There are also poisons made with snake venom that are mixed into food, causing severe ailments. These conditions, if accumulated over years, can lead to death, each requiring its own specific treatment.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Treating the Illness</strong>  </p>
<p>The scriptures describe several types of poisonous substances. In the mountainous regions of Guizhong, people create these using insects and snakes, storing them in vessels to let them consume each other. The one that survives is called &quot;gu.&quot; Its poison, when ingested in food or drink, can harm humans. If poisoned, one experiences intense abdominal pain as if being bitten by something, with symptoms including vomiting and blood that resembles rotting flesh. If not treated promptly, it can erode the five viscera, resulting in death. This illness varies in urgency; acute cases may lead to death within ten days or so, while chronic cases can drag on for years, causing internal turmoil and weakness, leading to a heaviness in the bones and a restless heart, while the patient&#39;s food also transforms into &quot;gu,&quot; slowly consuming the internal organs until death ensues. Upon death, the illness can spread to others, becoming a contagion. To identify it, one can test the patient&#39;s saliva; if it sinks, it is &quot;gu,&quot; if it floats, it is not. Alternatively, one can have the patient hold a large soybean; if the skin of the soybean swells and ruptures, it indicates &quot;gu,&quot; if it remains intact, then it is not. Placing a swan&#39;s skin under the patient while keeping them unaware can also help; if the condition worsens, it suggests &quot;gu,&quot; whereas if it does not worsen, it implies otherwise. The treatment method should not mimic the treatment of other ailments and must be conducted with careful examination. In ancient practices, the charred skin of a drum was burnt to ash and mixed with medicinal rice concocted to be consumed in small doses, often calling out the names of those associated with &quot;gu&quot; to ensure recovery. In any case of poisoning, chewing raw black beans without any foul taste and consuming sweet white alum indicates poisoning.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Treatise</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Poisoning</strong></p>
<p>In the mountainous areas of Liangguang, people collect various creatures like snakes, centipedes, slugs, and toads in a container, allowing them to devour each other. The winner is then worshipped as a spirit. They extract the poison and mix it with vegetables, fruits, and food to harm others, absurdly hoping for blessings and wealth. Some people become afflicted by this, experiencing countless symptoms, and many die over the years. There are also families that offer incense and sacrifices to their ancestors, calling it a curse, which can also cause illness; this is referred to by the world as a &quot;gu&quot; sickness. Because these are linked to the five sounds, they are termed the &quot;five gu.&quot; Such practices are common in remote border areas, but are rarely heard of in the central capitals.</p>
<p>The effects of gu poison cause severe abdominal and heart pain, as if something is being vomited out, and it feels like rotten flesh. If not treated immediately, it can consume the five internal organs and lead to death. Those afflicted may show symptoms of their saliva sinking when tested, indicating the presence of poison.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are those who use poison to harm others; if one wishes to know the name of the poisoner, one must burn the skin of a defeated drum into powder and drink it with a small dagger. After a moment, the name of the poisoner will be revealed. Command them to call out the name, and they will recover. There are also methods for treatment.</p>
<p>To test for poison, hold a large soybean; if the soybean swells and the skin splits, it indicates poison. If it does not swell and the skin does not split, it indicates otherwise. Furthermore, place a swan&#39;s skin beneath where the patient lies, taking care they do not notice it. If the illness is severe, this confirms poison; if not, it indicates otherwise. </p>
<p>Treatment must be careful and thorough, tested before proceeding. Nowadays, some people mistakenly believe they have poison if they experience bloating, which is especially erroneous. </p>
<p>Among poisons, some act quickly, causing death within days; others are slow, taking years, leading to weakness and eventual death after draining the organs. Once dead, their poison can infect others, causing a similar affliction.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>At the right time, one should boil soybeans and licorice, and drink the juice of watercress to clear all poisons. </p>
<p>For mountain bean root, regardless of the amount, if containing poison, finely grind it with water in a discreet manner and take a small quantity while keeping quiet, without taking more afterwards; alternatively, mix it with two pennies of alcohol. </p>

<p><strong>Bewitchment of the Golden Silkworm</strong></p>
<p>There exists a poison of the golden silkworm, such as that found between the two Yuè regions where people keep them in their homes, using schemes to send them away but they do not depart. Initially, there was a method of marrying the golden silkworm; if a family comes into contact with this silkworm, then from generation to generation, they will never be free from it, making it a most detestable thing. It is said that a spirit causes mischief, attaching itself to this family and refusing to leave. If there are those in the household who wish it gone, they will wrap all of their worldly possessions along with the golden silkworm, intentionally placing them by the roadside. If someone unaware of the reason picks them up and takes them home, the golden silkworm will attach itself to the person and cannot be removed. Even repeated prayers and offerings will not suffice. One must take three qian of thunderbolts powdered into fine dust, mixing it with a small amount of white alum. Should the golden silkworm appear, one should sprinkle a small amount of this powder onto the body of the worm, which will immediately transform into red water like blood. The spirit will certainly be enraged and cause trouble. Should there be a sound in the air, one must listen to where the sound is loudest and sprinkle the powder into the sky; thus, the spirit will curse the ungrateful and depart, never to return. At the time of encountering the object, one will inevitably become suddenly wealthy, as objects fall from the sky. The person will be exceedingly joyous and will honor the golden silkworm in the cabinet, praying to it morning and evening. After a while, the person&#39;s face will turn golden, resembling the golden silkworm. If the medicine is ineffective, and after a long time, their abdomen will swell up like a drum. At that time, this trend was rampant in Shu, where those who obtained a golden silkworm often could not escape death within five years, and the golden silkworm would not depart, frequently leading to the destruction of the entire household.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

If fresh, it will be blood; if old, it will take the form of soft-shelled turtles or dung beetles and other mixed creatures. The pill and congealed blood should be collected and washed clean with water; it can save three people. If poisoned and unable to speak, cut open and administer the medicine.  </p>
<p>For snake and scorpion poisons, apply well-ground vinegar to the affected area for instant relief. If the medicine has taken effect, if you already know the source of the poison, there is no need to investigate further. If reported, the poison will recur without rescue. After recovery, continue to avoid alcohol, meat, and poisonous foods for one month; only soft rice is permissible. If urgent, choose an auspicious day and prepare meticulously.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To eliminate the poison of Gu: use Ping Wei San, mix it with raw lacquer to make pills the size of a black walnut, and take seventy to a hundred pills with warm wine on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>For all kinds of Gu poison and other heat poisons, as well as seasonal heat illnesses with bleeding from the mouth and nose: use seven pieces of human urine, burn them to ash, mix with water, and take it in one go. Cover to induce sweating for recovery. Do not take this remedy lightly; it is very effective. 【’Wai Tai’】</p>
<p>For the poison from livestock: use powdered liver of a hidden dragon, the size of an egg, mixed with water to induce vomiting.</p>
<p>In Min and Guang regions, where Gu is common, it is advised that when traveling, one should ask the host: “Does your home have Gu poison?” If they inquire, do not proceed. The Buddha’s spell for dispelling Gu poison states: &quot;Gusu Zhuo, Moya Zhuo, I know that Gu poison comes in four corners, the father is the spherical dome, the mother is the woman Yashe, with countless relatives; now I know you all, Maha Saman.&quot;</p>
<p>For Gu poison: The ‘Mei Shi Fang’ states that when afflicted by Gu poison, there may be blood in the stool like goose liver, or vomiting blood, or heart and abdominal pain as if bitten by something. If not treated immediately, consuming one’s internal organs will lead to death. To identify the Gu, have the patient spit into water; if it sinks, it is Gu; if it floats, it is not. Use the ash of rotten drum skin and mix it with wine, taking a spoonful to immediately call out the name of the Gu master. 【’Mei Shi Fang’】</p>
<p>To treat Gu: take rotten drum skin, five inches wide and one foot long, and rose root about the size of a thumb, with one liter of water and three liters of wine, boil down to two liters, and take it; the Gu worms will be expelled immediately. 【’Wai Tai’】<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All food and flavors serve to nourish life. If food is harmful, it can cause injury. Unless one resorts to medicinal concoctions, how can one avoid eating? It is evident that people now do not regulate their diets, and illness arises rapidly, as if not caused by food. To preserve one’s life, one must know what to avoid. Some foods are compatible with health, while others are harmful to the body. If one eats what is suitable, it enhances the body; if detrimental, it leads to illness, which can result in danger that is often difficult to remedy. </p>
<p>When preparing medicinal decoctions to detoxify, even if it is said to be an emergency remedy, one should not consume them hot; poisons worsen with heat, so it is better to drink them cold. Liver diseases should avoid pungent foods, heart diseases should avoid salty foods, spleen diseases should avoid sour foods, lung diseases should avoid bitter foods, and kidney diseases should avoid sweet foods. In spring, do not eat foods that affect the liver; in summer, do not eat foods affecting the heart; in autumn, do not eat foods affecting the lungs; in winter, do not eat those affecting the kidneys; and throughout the four seasons, avoid foods that harm the spleen.</p>
<p>It is explained: in spring, one should not eat liver because the liver is dominant, and the spleen is weakened; eating liver would further nourish the liver and exacerbate the spleen’s weakness, making it irreparable. Moreover, when the liver is dominant, one must not introduce stale energy into it, for this could harm the spirit. If it is not the time of dominance, then when it is deficient, nourishing the liver is beneficial. The same applies to the other organs.</p>
<p>One should not eat the liver lightly; if it dies, it is even more critical. The heart, being the seat of consciousness, should not be consumed, so that one can repay their past in the next life. Any meat or liver that falls to the ground without touching dust should not be eaten. Pork that floats in water should not be consumed. All meats and fish, if not eaten by dogs or pecked by birds, should not be eaten. Any meat that is not dried, or moves when roasted over fire, or moves in water should not be consumed.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On the Poisons in Food and Drink</strong></p>
<p>Animals that die of natural causes are all poisonous and should not be eaten. Fish without gills are poisonous, and those with large gills are also poisonous. Turtles with red algae patterns on their bellies are poisonous. Crabs with hair on their bellies are poisonous. Wine that is just boiled and then removed from the heat is poisonous; in Jiangnan, this is called &quot;firehead wine,&quot; and drinking it can cause hemorrhoids and bleeding. During summer months, any food that has been left overnight is poisonous. Wine left overnight in copper or tin vessels becomes poisonous. When food is heated in copper, the vapor rises and condenses into droplets that fall into the food, making it poisonous. Soup that has been left overnight can be poisonous; washing it can lead to scabies. The double almonds of peaches and apricots are deadly poisonous. Fruits that haven&#39;t yet formed pits are all poisonous and can cause sores and boils. In summer and autumn, fruits that fall to the ground and are infested with worms are poisonous, causing leakage when consumed. Rainwater that leaks into a house is poisonous; consuming it can cause bloating and even death, and using it for washing hands can lead to scabies, as repeatedly observed. Stagnant water in marshes is poisonous; drinking it can result in abdominal tumors. Hot spring water in baths should not be drunk, as it causes bloating and discomfort; it is only suitable for bathing to relieve skin ailments, since the springs are sourced from sulfur, thus warm. Those suffering from skin issues should eat well before bathing for several days in a row to sweat it out and heal. Individuals with weak constitutions should avoid bathing lightly.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Five Stones</strong> by Sun Simiao</p>
<p>People who do not take the stones suffer from various ailments; skin diseases and fevers persist yearly, causing distress in their food and sleep, and their living conditions remain unpleasant. This issue not only affects their health but also complicates childbirth. The presence of stones in the body leads to universal troubles and emphasizes the importance of not taking the Five Stones. </p>
<p>Individuals over thirty may take stone medicine; however, if they are naturally robust, they should not take it recklessly. Those over forty must take it. For those over fifty, they may take a dose every three years; for those over sixty, every two years; and for those over seventy, once a year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is stated that those over fifty have diminished vitality, and taking stones can still be beneficial. Yet, for those over sixty, such consumption may lead to adverse effects. Therefore, regular consumption of stones keeps the hands and feet warm, vitalizes the marrow, dispels cold, and improves agility, allowing them to withstand extremes of heat and cold without succumbing to various illnesses; hence the importance of regular intake.</p>
<p>All stones used must be thoroughly refined. If any symptoms arise, they typically manifest as cold-induced headaches or heart discomfort, occurring periodically like intermittent fevers. If such signs appear, do not excessively take cold water but remedy it with warmth, ensuring that all foods are warm, except for wine.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is further said: One must never mix various foods when consuming stone substances. Even if there are a hundred delicacies laid out, do not indulge heavily in the flesh. If mixed too richly, there will inevitably be mutual harm, causing accumulation that does not dissipate, thereby disturbing the stones. If one holds their heart as prescribed, they will achieve what they seek; stone medicine is beneficial, and goodness cannot be enhanced. </p>
<p>In my thirty-eighth or thirty-ninth year, I regularly consumed five to six taels of milk, and since then, I have deeply understood this matter. As for rest and moderation, I have considerable insight into their essence. Those who cultivate health should pay careful attention to this! However, the milk stones must come from clean, pure, and smooth land, with patterns resembling bird feathers; everything must be entirely white to be consumed. As for those not from such land, one should be cautious and avoid them. Many can be deadly, even more so than poison. </p>
<p>Purple stones and white stones must reflect both internally and externally, being clear and bright. If not, they should also not be consumed. The five stones of cold stone are a new formula; this method has been said to not have been known by ancient sages. None among the feudal lords of the Han dynasty have used it. Since the time of the scholar Huanfu Shian, there have been those introducing such potions, yet none have ended well, facing overthrow and collapse. </p>
<p>Since I have become discerning, I have personally witnessed officials from all ranks suffering various fates. Thus, I would prefer to eat wild kudzu rather than take the five stones. It is evident that it is extremely toxic, and one must be cautious! Wise individuals encountering this formula should immediately burn it and not leave it unattended!<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Neutralizing the Poisons of a Hundred Herbs</strong></p>
<p>Licorice neutralizes the poisons of a hundred herbs; this is truly like pouring hot water on snow, and bears a similar mystical quality. If someone is poisoned by aconite or calabash seeds, licorice in the stomach will settle the situation immediately. For those poisoned by rhubarb, swallowing onion soup can quickly remedy it. If one is poisoned by wild yam, simply drinking a mixture of soil and water will stop the effects. Such matters are as clear as turning one&#39;s hand over; they should be widely known. Yet, few are willing to learn them, which is truly lamentable. </p>
<p>Soy bean juice is also said to neutralize the poisons of a hundred herbs. In my experience, it is quite limited compared to licorice. Furthermore, it can be enhanced to make a sweet bean soup, yielding even more remarkable results. For someone who takes Jade Pot Pill and vomits uncontrollably, no medicine can stop it, but blue juice taken will immediately resolve the issue. Such knowledge should be recognized. These are established rules, no further experimentation is necessary.</p>
<p>In the realm of antidotes, there are countless regulations; if one does not specify a few, learners cannot fully comprehend. I am merely providing examples: For stone poison, use white duck excrement and ginseng juice. For arsenic poison, use fibrous roots. For iron powder poison, use magnet. For talc poison, administer soy bean juice and white goose bone. For防葵 poison, apply root juice of sunflower. For euphorbia poison, use calamus juice. For balloon flower poison, use white porridge. For cassia seed poison, utilize soy bean juice. (Unclear term) poison, treat with gardenia juice. Chicken egg poison can be neutralized with pure vinegar. For sword grass poison, use clear water. For wild yam poison, employ soil and fecal juice. For apricot kernel poison, take blue juice. The poisons of a hundred herbs can be neutralized with licorice, hyssop, and the juices of large and small beans, and blue leaf root.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

When preparing dishes, one must first use pure sesame oil in a clean pot to cook until fully heated, then add the meat to stir-fry, and finally, boil it in clean water; this method does not breach any toxicity. In regions like Huizhou and Chizhou, people eat beef daily without regard to spring or summer, primarily due to the proper preparation methods, which results in very few cases of poisoning. For those affected by food toxins, simply drinking one or two cups of sesame oil often induces vomiting and dispels the toxins, leading to recovery in all cases.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Resolving All Poisons</h3>
<p>For resolving various medicinal poisons, it is advisable to use juices from shepherd&#39;s purse, white hyacinth bean, cowpea, licorice, syrup, rice syrup, and ashes from burnt silkworm paper; all can be used indiscriminately. Generally, antidote decoctions should not be taken hot; they should be consumed cool, for heat intensifies the power of the poison. However, this specifically applies to heat poisons. When resolving poisons such as those from the wood peach, fungi, coptis, or gypsum, which correspond to the cold yin poison, must one still avoid heat and instead consume cold drinks?</p>
<h3>Withstanding Arsenic Poison</h3>
<p>In the world, those who ingest arsenic poison suffer from excruciating pain in their organs, a distended abdomen, protruding tongues, and bleeding eyes leading to death—truly pitiful. The remedy is to use the detoxifying divine pill: two taels of rhubarb, five qian of raw licorice, one tael of alum, and three taels of angelica, boiled in water to make a decoction. Drink several bowls quickly, which will lead to a great purging; otherwise, death will ensue. Once the arsenic has entered the organs, it cannot simply be expelled by sheep&#39;s blood or raw licorice. That&#39;s why I have created a different method for salvation. If one drinks it without purging, the intestines are already ruptured, and what can be done? However, if used promptly, there is no case of death; one should not rigidly follow the vomiting method without flexibility. If one has just ingested arsenic, it is best to use three taels of raw licorice, urgently prepare a decoction with half a bowl of sheep&#39;s blood, mix it well, and drink it for immediate vomiting and recovery. If vomiting does not occur, use the rhubarb remedy quickly, and there’s no reason it cannot be saved.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>San Yin Jie Du Wan</strong>: This remedy treats poisoning from mistakenly consuming toxic plants, as well as general toxins in various substances, saving lives from imminent death. </p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ban lan gen (isatis root), washed and dried, four ounces.</li>
<li>Guan zhong (dryopteris), two ounces, with hair removed.</li>
<li>Qing dai (indigo powder), ground.</li>
<li>Sheng gan cao (raw licorice), each one ounce.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind these into a powder, then mix with honey to form pills the size of a tung seed, coated with Qing dai. If one feels lightheaded, it indicates poisoning; take fifteen pills, chew them thoroughly, and wash them down with freshly drawn water to detoxify. Alternatively, making the pills with water-soaked steamed buns is even better. Regularly taking three to five pills helps relieve summer heat.</p>
<p><strong>Shen Xian San</strong> (Divine Immortal Powder) or <strong>Ya Shu Dan</strong> (Jade Pivot Pill); also known as <strong>Zi Jin Ding</strong> (Purple Gold Tablet): This treats all types of drug poisons, mushroom toxins, mouse toxin, harmful fungi, mineral poisons, toxins from eating plague-infested cattle and horse meat, pufferfish poison, seasonal epidemics, malaria, sudden throat closings, spleen diseases leading to jaundice, red eye sores, overheating, and fiery toxins. It is also suitable for those who choke, drown, have injuries from falls, or suffer from unburst boils, fish belly ulcers, burns from hot water or fire, and bites from centipedes, dogs, or snakes. It assists both men and women suffering from madness or ghostly energies. Everyone, whether at home or away, should not be without this medicine, as it is a true treasure for public welfare and family health. In areas with abundant toxins, like Lingnan, if one feels unwell, taking this immediately will provide relief.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the valley of Erguang Mountain, there is a plant called Hu Man Grass, also known as the Heartbreak Grass. If a person swallows it with hot water, they die instantly; if with lukewarm water, they die slowly. If one takes a poisonous snake and kills it, covers it with this grass, and sprinkles water on it, after several days, mushrooms will grow on it. This can be ground into powder and mixed with wine to poison someone. At first, there are no symptoms, but upon drinking more wine, the poison will immediately take effect and cause death.</p>
<p>It is customary for promiscuous women to often form unions with men from the north, establishing feelings with them but many are reluctant to chase them away. They secretly put medicine into food, and when the northern men return, they say: &quot;Your friend has come;&quot; if the men follow these words, they will be cured with an antidote. However, if they delay and do not leave, they will die—this is called the Scheduled Year Medicine. </p>
<p>When a northern man arrives, he should take note of this. If he feels poisoned, with the four bodily elements out of balance, he should take this medicine immediately; or if poison is placed in meat such as chicken, pork, fish, sheep, goose, or duck, consuming this will trigger the poison. Taking one grain of this medicine urgently will result in either vomiting or diarrhea, and he will recover immediately.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a woman who had been suffering from tuberculosis for a long time, eaten by corpse insects. She ground one grain of this medicine and after a while, expelled over a thousand small worms, with one large one being in two segments. After that, she only took Suhexiang pills, and within half a month, she returned to her normal state. For cattle and horses suffering from poisoning, this remedy is also effective, with no exceptions.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

<p>For food poisoning with fullness and discomfort: take three taels of bitter realgar, chew it, mix with two and a half sheng of wine, boil down to one sheng, and take it all at once; this will induce vomiting and cure the ailment.</p>
<p>For poisoning from eating various foods: dig a pit beside the latrine about one foot deep, fill it with water, take seven pieces of latrine wood, burn them to create smoke, and throw them into the pit. Then drink four to five sheng of the water; this will cure you. If in urgent need and unable to find wood, simply dig a hole and use the water to drink. </p>
<p>Another method: hold one piece of shell, and after a moment, vomit the food to recover. </p>
<p>For poisoning from meat of six animals: take the dried feces of the six animals and grind it into powder to take with water. If the meat comes from an animal that died naturally, take a specific measurement of huangbai (barberry) powder mixed with water, and taking it shortly will provide relief.</p>
<p>For poisoning from various foods: drinking Huanglong soup and rhino horn juice cures all. Drinking horse urine is also good. </p>
<p>For poisoning from certain medicines: take two to seven pieces of Qin swallow feathers, burn them to ash, and consume.</p>
<p>For those poisoned by wild kudzu who have died and cannot open their mouths: take a green bamboo, removing two nodes, and inject cold water into the sides and above the navel. When it warms, it will change. In a moment, the mouth will open, and when it opens, take medicine immediately, and recovery will be instant. Just be sure to change the water several times.</p>
