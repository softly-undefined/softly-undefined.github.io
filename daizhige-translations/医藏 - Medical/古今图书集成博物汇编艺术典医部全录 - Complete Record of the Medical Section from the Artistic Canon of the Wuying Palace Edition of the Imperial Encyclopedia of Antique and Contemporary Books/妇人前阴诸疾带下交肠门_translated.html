<p><strong>Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms of Genital Issues</strong></p>
<p>When the Shaoyin pulse is slippery and rapid, sores will form in the genitalia. For necrotic sores within, wash with wolf tooth decoction. For women with cold in the genitals, administer warming medicines internally, with the main remedy being the snake bed seed powder. When stomach qi descends and the genitalia emit gas, this indicates excess from consumed food; administer the gao fa decoction to guide it.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Classic</strong> (Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe)</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>A rapid Shaoyin pulse indicates qi stagnation with sores in the genitalia. For women, if the Shaoyin pulse is taut, it indicates an intestinal blockage. If a woman’s abdomen swells like a gourd, with pain radiating to the lower back, administer the apricot kernel decoction. If the Shaoyin pulse is floating and dynamic, this indicates a state of deficiency; if floating, it is deficient, and if dynamic, it indicates pain—women may experience a loss of discharge. The master states: if the pulse feels floating and tight, it signifies pain in the body; if there is no pain, then this should be treated. Why is treatment necessary? It means there is pain in the intestines, rumbling in the abdomen, or coughing due to loss of bowel movement. If a woman presents this pulse, she should undergo treatment for gas emission. The master states: if the pulse at the inch is floating and weak, floating suggests deficiency. Weak signifies lack of blood; floating denotes shortness of breath, while weakness indicates heat and spontaneous sweating. The fuyang pulse is floating and slippery; floating suggests fullness of qi, while slippery indicates coldness, with a preference for burping and sour ingestion, as the qi fails to descend, causing a chill in the lower abdomen. The Shaoyin pulse that is weak and fine indicates insufficient blood, weakness provokes wind, and the weak and fine pulses clash, causing discomfort with coldness in the genitalia, stomach qi descends, emitting gas, resulting in a clamorous condition.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Women&#39;s Health Recipes</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty by Chen Ziming)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Yin Diseases</strong>  </p>
<p>When a woman&#39;s Yin descends and prolapses, it may be due to damage to the uterine vessels, deficiency and coldness of the internal organs, or excessive effort during childbirth.<br><strong>[Note: In such cases, the primary treatment should focus on replenishing the original Qi. If there is liver and spleen stagnation with Qi deficiency causing descent, use the Supplement the Center and Benefit Qi Decoction. If there is liver fire with damp heat, leading to urinary blockage, use the Dragon Gallbladder Decoction to drain the liver.]</strong>  </p>
<p>For women experiencing itching in the Yin area, this is often caused by three pests residing in the intestines and stomach, which erode the Yin due to organ deficiency. If mild, it leads to itching; if severe, it results in pain.<br><strong>[Note: This condition belongs to the transformation of the liver channel, and one should use the Dragon Gallbladder Decoction and the Happy Powder for internal treatment. Externally, a paste made from powdered peach kernels and realgar, or using chicken liver inserted into the Yin area, may be employed to suppress these pests.]</strong><br><strong>[Referring to the &quot;Great Compendium&quot;: The activity of the three pests occurs within the Yin, creating heat; mild cases present with itching, while severe cases cause pain.]</strong>  </p>
<p>If a woman&#39;s Shaoyin pulse is rapid and slippery, there may be sores in the Yin, known as the &quot;hidden lower pests.&quot; Symptoms may include pain or itching, resembling the movement of pests, with pus and moisture running out. In severe instances, the Yin may be nearly eroded. This is all due to a disturbed heart spirit and weakened spleen and stomach, leading to stagnant Qi and blood. Internally, one should nourish the heart and strengthen the stomach, while using medicinal washes externally for treatment.<br><strong>[Note: The aforementioned condition indicates liver and spleen stagnation; an excess of wood leads to pest formation, necessitating the resolution of stagnation and clearing of the liver.]</strong>  <a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>A woman experiences swelling in the lower part of her body due to deficiency in the channels and collaterals, with wind pathogen invading, affecting the lower regions. This causes blood and qi to clash. </p>
<p>For symptoms arising from weakened qi and blood, use the &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang&quot; to tonify. If damp-heat in the liver channel is present, apply &quot;Long Dan Xie Gan Tang&quot; to drain and clear it. However, for conditions like swelling, coldness, and protrusion in the lower region, one should also refer to treatments for itching in that area. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Comprehensive Collection,&quot; female genital swelling occurs from deficiency and invasion by wind pathogens, with the channels being weak and wind invading them, causing stagnation due to clashing of wind and blood, which leads to qi being obstructed and capillaries blocked, resulting in swelling.</p>
<p>For cold in the lower region, caused by overexertion that injures the reproductive organs and invasion by wind-cold, prepare a mixture of three taels each of Wujia Pi (sichuan pepper), dried ginger, Danshen (salvia), Shechuangzi (flowering nutmeg), Shudihuang (cooked rehmannia), and Duzhong (eucommia), along with four taels of powdered breast milk, one tael of Asparagus root, and two taels of Digupi (floor bark), soaked in fifteen liters of wine for two nights. Take one cup before meals on an empty stomach. </p>
<p>For this condition, it belongs to damp-heat in the liver channel compounded by wind-cold. If there is difficulty in urination or distension and pain in the lower abdomen, use &quot;Long Dan Xie Gan Tang&quot;. If there are alternating cold and heat symptoms or menstrual irregularities, apply &quot;Jia Wei Xiao Yao San&quot;. If tiredness from cold and heat arises with poor appetite, use &quot;Jia Wei Si Jun Zi Tang&quot;. If there is irritation leading to heat, insomnia, and lack of appetite, apply &quot;Jia Wei Gui Pi Tang&quot;.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Xue&#39;s Medical Record (Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji)</p>
<pre><code>      Treating Yin Diseases
</code></pre>
<p>A woman develops sores in her yin, caused by the stagnation of emotions leading to excessive fire, harming the liver and spleen. Damp heat descends. The external symptoms include manifestations in the yin resembling snakes or mushrooms, or resembling a cockscomb, or accompanied by itchy, festering sores, or producing water, or causing swelling and dull pain; the internal symptoms include fatigue and internal heat, bitterness in the mouth, lack of taste in food, afternoon fever, or discomfort in the chest and ribs, or urinary distension and bloating, or red and white vaginal discharge, or frequent, painful urination. </p>
<p>For treatment: In cases of swelling and pain, use Si Wu Decoction with additional Chai Hu, Zhi Zi, Dan Pi, and Gan Cao; for damp itching, use Gui Pi Decoction with Chai Hu, Zhi Zi, and Dan Pi; for painful urination, use Long Dan Cao Decoction with Bai Zhu and Dan Pi; for rot and corruption, use Xiao Yao San with Shan Zhi and Chuan Xiong; for swelling, dull pain, and heaviness, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with Shan Zhi and Dan Pi, supplemented with external treatments.</p>
<p>When a woman experiences pain from intercourse affecting her husband&#39;s headaches, she should primarily use Bu Zhong Yi Qi and Liu Wei Di Huang to nourish the source of transformation. When a woman experiences pain during marriage, she should treat it similarly to her husband&#39;s headache, with mutual treatment.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> <em>(Ming, Li Zhan)</em></p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Yin Diseases</strong></p>
<p>When something protrudes about ten fingers from the yin like a snake, causing pain and difficulty in urination, take the &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction&quot; in the morning and &quot;Longdan Hepatobiliary Decoction&quot; in the evening, and apply licorice and artemisia ointment externally for treatment. </p>
<p>If something prostrudes like a mushroom or a cockscomb, accompanied by swelling and pain around it, this indicates liver stagnation and spleen deficiency. First, use &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction,&quot; adding gardenia, poria, plantago seeds, and green tangerine peel to clear the liver fire and gradually boost the spleen qi; then, use &quot;Gui Pi Decoction&quot; with added gardenia, poria, and chuanxiong for adjustment, applying licorice and artemisia ointment externally. </p>
<p>If the yin orifice protrudes due to strenuous activity, it suggests blood deficiency; use &quot;Four Substances Decoction&quot; with added dragon bone. If it&#39;s qi deficiency, use &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction.&quot; </p>
<p>If insects appear inside (above with hiding insects below) like small maggots, this signifies severe damp-heat and stagnant heart qi leading to the formation. It is advised to take &quot;Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Decoction,&quot; &quot;Bu Xin Decoction,&quot; or &quot;Gulou Liyuan Pill,&quot; and externally use fresh mugwort juice mixed with realgar powder, burn it to produce smoke for inhalation, and further use realgar powder to disperse within the yin. </p>
<p>If fine worms emerge, causing unbearable itching and resulting in death upon entering the organs, it resembles symptoms of chills, fever, and tuberculosis.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>First, prepare a decoction of snake bed seeds, clean, and dry; then use powdered dry catalpa bark and mix in one-quarter of dried alum and a small amount of musk to apply, which will take effect immediately. For severe swelling and pain in the lower region with constipation, use bitter orange and tangerine poultice; for swelling and pain alone, take a four-substance decoction with added bupleurum, mountain gardenia, peony root, and gentian. For persistent lower pain, add dry plantain and windproof to the four-substance decoction. For dampness with itching, flowing discharge, and pain due to excessive worry, take the return to spleen decoction with added bupleurum, mountain gardenia, peony root, peony, and raw licorice. </p>
<p>For swelling and pain in the lower region that does not close, use the carefree powder or the ten complete tonics. If the swelling subsides but does not close, take the middle-boosting qi tonic; if the swelling droops, add mountain gardenia and peony root. For lower discomfort without closure, accompanied by cold and heat in urination, fatigue, and reduced appetite, take the middle-boosting qi tonic with added angelica, bupleurum, about three grams, and adjust with poria and mountain gardenia. </p>
<p>If the lower region does not close, with urination that drips, and abdominal distension described as a lump that causes pain, take the carefree powder with added bupleurum, mountain gardenia, and plantago seeds. </p>
<p>For bleeding during intercourse, likely due to trauma, and liver-spleen deficiency leading to inability to retain blood, take the middle-boosting qi tonic. Externally, use prepared moxa wrapped in cloth and inserted into the lower region, or use ashes from charred green peels of various hair. If bleeding is excessive with mixed symptoms, adjust and tonify the liver and spleen for self-recovery.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Pulse Diagnosis</p>
<p>The Shaoyin pulse is superficial and active; when superficial, it indicates emptiness, and when active, it signifies pain—possibly leading to bleeding or displacement of the yin region. The Shaoyin pulse may be slippery and rapid, indicating possible qi dysuria or sores in the yin region causing pain and itching. If the Shaoyin pulse is faint, it suggests blocked qi in the bladder. In women, this may result in sores in the yin region. A strong pulse is easier to treat, while a weak pulse signifies greater loss. If the Shaoyin pulse is taut, there may be pain in the yin region and intestinal distention.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The pulse of the kidney is deeply submerged, indicating itching in the genital area or pain in the lower back and legs, both of which suggest the defensive qi is not rising and there is excessive damp-heat. In women, the pulse is tight, thin, and long, stopping at the wrist; this indicates severe pain in the genitals that radiates to the navel.</p>
<p>Summary of Medical Principles - Six Essentials by Zhang Sanxi (Ming Dynasty)<br>General Discussion on Female Diseases</p>
<p>Female genital sores arise from emotional distress and excessive fire, damaging the liver and spleen, with damp-heat descending. The external manifestations include swellings in the genitals that protrude like snakes, commonly referred to as protrusions; some protrude like mushrooms; others resemble cockscomb; there may also be pain, swelling, damp-itch, ulceration with discharge, and sensations of fullness or heaviness. </p>
<p>The internal manifestations include dry mouth and internal heat, fatigue, irregular menstrual cycles, tastelessness in food, afternoon fevers, chest discomfort, hypochondriac fullness, lower abdominal pain and distension, as well as red or white leukorrhea, and painful urination. </p>
<p>Treatment methods: for swelling and pain, it is appropriate to use a combination of Four Herbs with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, Dan Pi; for damp-itching, it is best to use Gui Pi with Shan Zhi, Dan Pi, and Chai Hu; for painful urination, Long Dan Cao San with Bai Zhu and Dan Pi is recommended; for ulceration, add modified Xiao Yao San; for heaviness and fullness, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi with Shan Zhi and Dan Pi. The method of Xue should not be changed.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For women suffering from vulvar sores, it is due to damp-heat invading the liver channel. When there are worms in the vulva, the itching is unbearable and if it invades the organs, it can lead to death and cause fever and chills, resembling tuberculosis. Use cooked pig liver, cut into long strips, and while it is hot, place it inside the vulva to expel the worms. The worms will emerge upon sensing the fishy smell; repeat this several times. It is also effective to take herbal medications that drain the liver and nourish the blood.</p>
<p>Itching in the vulva is likewise indicative of damp-heat in the liver; the formula for draining the liver is effective. For thin individuals with dry itching, it pertains to liver yin deficiency, primarily connected to the Kidney and Heart; externally, wash with a decoction of cnidium seeds. (If the worm is hidden, treat the sores similarly by differentiating between deficiency and excess.)</p>
<p>If the pulse is rapid and there are sores in the vulva, after a long time, worms may develop in the lower part; use cooked pig liver cut into long strips inserted into the vulva to draw out the worms, then proceed with medication to kill the worms.</p>
<p>For swollen and painful conditions in the vulva, which a woman cannot endure, if there is a protrusion resembling an eggplant, it is analogous to a man&#39;s hernia, but is referred to as accumulative masses; both belong to the turbid qi of the liver channel. The treatment is to soothe the liver and disperse qi, similar to treating hernia. Externally, chop and stir-fry bitter orange and use it warm in a cloth pouch to apply, changing when it cools. This is effective for all vulval pain.</p>
<p>For pain during a new marriage, it is advisable to soothe the depression and harmonize the blood with a combination of the four substances plus cyperus and safflower.</p>
<p>For women with excessive coldness and heaviness in the vulva, it is often caused by the downward flow of damp phlegm, so use equal parts of Atractylodes and Chen Pi along with herbs to dispel wind; externally, sit in medicated solutions is quite effective.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Wang Kentang, Ming Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Female Conditions</strong></p>
<p>In women, if hemorrhoids occur in the lower region, all protrusions from the nine orifices are termed hemorrhoids. The condition known as “eggplant disease” in women refers to these hemorrhoids, which arise from heart agitation, are easier to treat with yellow liquid, but harder to cure with white liquid. The <em>Good Prescription</em> states: if a woman&#39;s lesser yin pulse is rapid and slippery, there must be sores in the lower region, known as &quot;crawling insect sores,&quot; which may cause pain or itching, resembling the movement of insects. If there is a profuse outflow of fluid and significant erosion, this results from heart distress and weak stomach energy, leading to stagnation of qi and blood. The classics say: all pains and itching sores are associated with the heart. Furthermore, it states that the yangming governs muscles, and both pain and itching are related to the heart. Therefore, treatment should focus on nourishing the heart and stomach, and externally using fumigation and sitting baths with medicinal treatments. </p>
<p>In cases of female sores in the lower region, the condition often pertains to cold. The classics say: an excess of the taiyang leads to sores in the qi, and if the hidden channels are not beneficial, the treatment involves bitter heat. Female sores occur due to the actions and erosion caused by three or nine insects. These insects exist between the intestines and stomach; if the organs are harmonious and blood and qi are sufficient, they cannot cause harm. However, if labor injures the meridians, leading to damage to the intestines and stomach, these insects will invade the lower region, resulting in minor itching or pain, or serious sores. Zhongjing states: if the pulse of the lesser yin is slippery and rapid, there will be sores in the lower region.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Women&#39;s genital ulcers arise from the emotional states causing stagnation of fire, damaging the liver and spleen, and heat and dampness descending as a result. Their forms are indeed various, but all stem from the transformation of pathogenic fire. </p>
<p>If a snake-like shape protrudes about an inch, with heavy water-like symptoms, this indicates sinking spleen energy along with sweating fire. In the morning, take a tonic to nourish the center and boost qi, and in the evening, take a Dragon Gallbladder Decoction to drain the liver. Apply a powder of realgar and rhododendron externally, and the condition will gradually improve. </p>
<p>If the protrusion resembles a fungus or a chicken comb, and is swollen and painful around the edges, this results from liver stagnation and spleen deficiency. Start by using a tonic to nourish the center and boost qi, adding gardenia, poria, and citrus peel to clear the liver and supplement the spleen, while also raising central qi. Furthermore, use a Gui Pi Decoction with gardenia, ligusticum, poria, cyperus, and dried tangerine peel for regulation.</p>
<p>If the genital area suddenly swells and becomes painful, it may be due to labor injury to the blood system and damp fire flowing downwards; treat it with a Four Substance Decoction adding moutan, alisma, pollen, and bupleurum. </p>
<p>If there are parasites like small maggots within (hidden upper and lower), this indicates heart qi stagnation transformed by pathogenic fire; use the Four Substance Decoction with berberine, gentian, houttuynia, and acuaticum to unblock and disperse the stagnation in the heart’s orifices. Externally, apply ginkgo powder to the affected area.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>If there are lumps outside the genitals and fine worms growing inside that cause unbearable itching, these worms, once they invade the organs, can lead to death, causing intermittent chills and fever, resembling consumption. Women with this condition, out of shame, often refuse to discuss it. Over time, they become emaciated with yellowed skin, experiencing chills and fevers, coughing with phlegm, and many go untreated. If this condition arises, promptly administer Xiao Yao San and take Lu Hui pills twice a day. Externally, apply Ginkgo powder wrapped in cotton and insert it into the vagina to kill the worms and relieve itching; improvement will be seen in half a month. If the vagina remains open and does not close, it is due to excessive worry; administer Tong Yao San and Gui Pi Decoction with additional Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, Bai Shao, and Dan Pi taken intermittently. For bleeding during intercourse, it indicates liver deficiency with excess heat unable to store blood; use Si Wu Decoction with Da Zao, Huang Qin, Shan Zhi, and Chai Hu. If there is swelling and pain due to new sexual activity, apply a mixture of pearl powder and pork spinal marrow. Additionally, if a woman remains in a secluded room for a long time, the stagnant fire of desire can lead to this condition; prolonged invasion of this evil fire can cause itching and the production of worms. These worms can corrode the internal organs, leading to pain, foul discharge, dry mouth and heat, and emaciation with refusal to eat. Those with this condition cannot be cured by medicine and will ultimately die. This is also called the loss of harmony syndrome.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Secret Record of the Stone Chamber</strong> <em>(Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo)</em></p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Methods</strong></p>
<p>If a woman develops worms inside her vagina, it is caused by damp heat. It is effective to use chicken liver in powdered medicine to attract them, but it is even better to use three or four earthworms and a few scallions, dry them over a fire, and powder them. Boil this in a bowl of honey until it forms a paste, then crush the medicine into it and insert it into the vagina; the worms will die and naturally be expelled with urination. </p>
<p>Moreover, if a woman has sores near the vaginal opening that cause constant itching and pain, applying the following prescription as a wash will yield immediate results: use one tael of Chinese lovage, three qian of Sichuan pepper, three qian of alum, and ten bowls of water, then boil down to five bowls. Use the hot liquid for fumigation first, and when it cools, wash with it. One application will stop the itching, two will stop the pain, and within three days, she will fully recover. Split the treatment over five days, and wash once each day for exceptional effectiveness. </p>
<p>A woman may feel embarrassed to discuss her issues, but generally, it is either cold or heat related.

<p>The &quot;Jia Yi Classic&quot; states: For women experiencing itching in the genitals, abdominal heat and pain, lingering breast issues, irregularities at the vaginal entrance, coldness in the lower abdomen, genital itching and pain, and amenorrhea, the center point is key. For women with hands and feet cramping, abdominal fullness and hernias, menstrual irregularities, lingering breast issues related to infertility, genital itching, and vaginal intercourse issues, acupuncture at the point on the lower abdomen is essential. </p>
<p>For abdominal fullness, hernias, lingering breast issues, infertility, genital itching, needle at the &quot;Stone Gate&quot; point. For women experiencing pain in the genitals, acute pain in the lower abdomen, acupuncture at the &quot;Yin Ling Quan&quot; point is indicated. </p>
<p>For women with irregular discharges of red and white, dryness and pain in the genitals, disharmony in yin and yang, a hard and swollen lower abdomen, urinary blockages, acupuncture at the &quot;Qiao Gu&quot; point is recommended. </p>
<p>For women discharging greenish fluid, not stopping the flow of red discharge, with genital itching and pain, and hard lower abdomen discomfort, acupuncture at the &quot;Xia Liao&quot; point is advised.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Those who have pain in the waist and buttocks—apply pressure on both sides. The cycle of life and death is counted with the moon; inserting needles should be immediate. </p>
<p>If the lower abdomen is distended and painful, radiating to the genitals, when the menstrual flow arrives, there will be pain in the waist and spine, with masses in the abdomen and cold sensations in the lower parts; the water pathways govern this condition.</p>
<p>For women who are childless, with the genitals protruding and unable to contain milky discharge, the upper gate regulates it. </p>
<p>If a woman’s genitals protrude and her limbs are weak with a feeling of heaviness, the point of intersection must be addressed.</p>
<p>When a woman&#39;s menstrual flow is obstructed or suddenly ceases, with abdomen distention, retention of urine, feelings of heat in the body, and cramping pain in the abdomen (a sign of the presence of an obstruction), gas rises to the upper part; release is required when the gas reaches a certain point.</p>
<p>For women experiencing irregularities, with protruding genitals and leaking menstrual flow, the grain gate is targeted.</p>
<p>In cases of hernias and masses in women, pressing as if washing both thighs, with distention in the lower abdomen, pain from protruding genitals when menstruation comes, swelling or itching in the genitals, drink juices like such as hibiscus soup—if blood is blocked with no offspring and lack of appetite, the curved spring is the point of treatment.</p>
<p>If there is coldness in the genitals, the return point is to be managed.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The lunar cycle is unfavorable; experiencing bleeding leads to a reversal of well-being, affecting the interstitial areas. The &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; states: when the lunar cycle is unfavorable and there are signs of red and white bleeding, it indicates a reversal of health due to cold and dampness. For treatment, perform six punctures at the interstitial areas and apply moxibustion three times at the acupuncture point found between the big toe and the adjacent toe. </p>
<p>The points Shuiyuan and Zhaohai govern the absence of menstruation, indicating excessive cold and dampness leading to obstruction, with pain underneath the heart region. Zhaohai also governs excessive bleeding from the lower body, swelling or itching within, and can drain clear fluids similar to mingling with vegetable juice. </p>
<p>For women experiencing absence of menstruation combined with excessive bleeding, puncturing deep into the area for three times and applying moxibustion three times is advised, with the acupuncture point located just in front of the inner ankle bone. </p>
<p>Red and white bleeding indicates dry pain within the lower body, creating disharmony between Yin and Yang, resulting in hardness in the lower abdomen and urinary obstruction. Deep puncturing into the area by one and a half inches followed by moxibustion three times is recommended, with the acupuncture point located one inch below the Zhongji point. </p>

<p>The &quot;Langhuan Memorandum&quot; states: A woman suffered from itching in her private parts, unable to confess to anyone, enduring great distress. She usually revered the statue of Guanyin with utmost sincerity. During her illness, she saw a nun bringing a box of medicine, saying: &quot;Boil this and wash it, and you will be cured.&quot; Suddenly the nun disappeared. Upon inspection, she found it contained snake bed seeds, wu zhu yu (a type of fruit), and bitter gentian.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; mentions: A woman suffered from damp sores located below the navel and around her private areas, resembling a horse knife, but without sores elsewhere. She experienced heat, itching, and pain, along with frequent, painful urination and excretion of yellow fluid, as well as decreased appetite and swelling of the body and face. The doctor treated her with remedies for sores, using eel, pine resin, and yellow lead, which exacerbated her heat and pain due to improper treatment. Upon careful inquiry, it was revealed that she had a craving for alcohol and was fond of fish and crabs, which cause wind. She was urgently instructed to wash off the ointments with warm water and then ground four taels of purslane, mixing it with one tael of indigo, and applied it to the sores. Immediately, the heat diminished, and both pain and itching disappeared. She continued to take Ba Zheng Powder, three times a day, to dissipate the excess heat. Each time the medication dried out, fresh damp medicine was reapplied. In this manner, a third of the condition improved in two days, two-thirds improved in five days, and she was completely healed in twenty days. After her recovery, she was asked how this illness occurred. She replied: &quot;It was due to wind-heat toxins accumulating in the lower body, causing gas buildup, potentially leading to intestinal abscesses or hemorrhoids.&quot; She was advised to avoid alcohol and wind-causing substances. Later, unable to refrain from drinking, she did indeed develop internal hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>The &quot;Six Essentials of Medical Principles&quot; states: A woman has a protrusion about five inches from her vagina, experiencing oppressive pain and a feeling of heaviness, with profuse watery discharge and difficulty in urination.

The symptoms gradually improve; then, alternate with Gui Pi Decoction, adding gardenia, poria, chuanxiong, and huangbo for regulation and healing. This method can also be used for cases with parasites. For pus, water retention, and pain, use an enhanced Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, combined with chái, poria, and stir-fried gardenia for efficacy.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; mentions: A woman has a protrusion resembling a fungus, with surrounding swelling and pain, frequent urination, internal heat, afternoon heat, sensations of itchiness and pain, and a feeling of heaviness in the lower abdomen. This indicates an obstruction of liver and spleen qi, where liver damp-heat causes swelling and pain, and spleen deficiency leads to heaviness. Begin with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding gardenia, poria, and chuanxiong for regulation, and apply a mixture of fresh pig fat and rhubarb powder externally, leading to resolution.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>A woman experienced a protrusion of about five inches from her lower body, with heavy, painful sensations and profuse discharge.

Her symptoms gradually improved. Afterwards, she was given Gui Pi Decoction with added Shan Zhi (Gardenia), Fu Ling (Poria), Chuan Xiong (Szechuan lovage), and Huang Lian (Coptis) taken intermittently, which adjusted her condition and healed her. Later, due to overwork or anger, she experienced dampness and itching in the lower region, and difficulty with urination, so she used the previous medicines again, which resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman had necrosis in her lower region, with purulent discharge, swelling, pain, chills and fever, red and painful urination, internal heat causing thirst, fatigue in her limbs, and discomfort in her chest and sides, along with decreased appetite.

I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with one qian each of Chai Hu (Bupleurum) and Sheng Ma (Cimicifuga), and added one qian of Fu Ling and two qian of Shan Zhi; several doses resulted in slight improvement. She was then given Gui Pi Decoction with added Shan Zhi and Chuan Xiong, totaling over thirty doses, which alleviated all symptoms.

After taking several doses, she gradually improved; then Huanglian and Alisma were removed, and after a few more doses, she fully recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman had purulent discharge from her lower region, experiencing itching or pain, with a sensation reminiscent of insects crawling. Diagnosis revealed a slippery and rapid pulse in the Shaoyin position, indicating a sore in the yin, referred to as &quot;hidden insect below.&quot; This was caused by a disturbed heart spirit, weakened gastric energy, and stagnation of qi and blood. The treatment included a decoction of Cimicifuga, Angelica, Huanglian, Mutong, Angelica sinensis, Chuanxiong, Atractylodes, Poria, and Bupleurum. Additionally, a fumigation wash with Tuo Chong Tang was applied, followed by over two months of topical treatment with cattail pollen and mercury, leading to recovery. </p>
<p>In some cases, there could be a deficiency in the uterine channels, where wind pathogenic factors invade the yin, causing blood and qi to stagnate, resulting in swelling and pain. In such cases, the treatment should utilize a mixture of sweet flag powder. If there is a need for warmth, Zhi Shi should be fried and wrapped in a cloth; if cold, it should be reheated. </p>
<p>There might also be cases of deficiency in the uterine organs, with cold air causing a downward push, leading to a condition known as &quot;prolapse.&quot; This may occur due to exertion during childbirth and can be treated with a formula containing Angelica.

If there were itching and pain caused by parasites within, it was also associated with the liver; peach kernels and realgar were to be ground and introduced internally to kill them, alongside using herbs to clear the liver and relieve stagnation. Some used chicken liver for this, which was a method to eliminate the parasites.</p>

Her urinary incontinence indicated that her internal organs were irreparably damaged, ruling out the possibility of medication. Desperate for a cure, I stated: &quot;The itching is caused by parasites, while the pain indicates damage.&quot; Initially, I used several crucian carp mixed with spices, and once cooked, wrapped them in fine cotton, inserting them into her genital area for a long time.

They were placed in warm water and only died after some time. Her family rejoiced, believing she could be cured. I countered: &quot;Not so.

<p>A Woman&#39;s Dream of Intercourse with a Ghost</p>
<p>A Woman&#39;s Good Prescription 【Song - Chen Ziming】</p>
<p>Discussion on Pulse</p>
<p>Humans are born with the essence and energy of the five elements and are nourished by the spirit of the five organs. If one&#39;s regulation is out of balance and blood and qi are deficient, then ghostly evils can disturb the normal state, hiding away and not wanting to be seen, sometimes laughing alone, sometimes weeping; this is their sign. The pulse may be slow and hidden, or feel like a bird pecking, or it may come in a gentle, flowing manner, difficult to gauge. The face remains unchanged; this is also a sign. 【Note: The above symptoms largely arise from the seven emotions draining heart blood, leading to the spirit being unguarded. It is advisable to use calming and stabilizing medications to restore upright qi, allowing the spirit to find peace. If the pulse intermittently becomes large and then small, short and then long, this indicates ghostly influence; moxibustion at the &#39;Ghost Cry&#39; point is recommended.】 【Note from &#39;Da Quan&#39;: When yin and yang are harmonized and the organs are strong, how can evil spirits disturb them?】<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable Efficacy and Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Fang Xian]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overview of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Human beings possess five internal organs, within which reside seven spirits. They are born from the quintessence of the five elements, reliant on divine energy for sustenance. When yin and yang are harmonious, the organs and bowels thrive, and malevolent spirits cannot inflict harm. However, if the regulation is disrupted and vital energy weakens, evil spirits can invade, leading to disturbances. This is why women frequently encounter malevolent spirits in their dreams—due to the weakness of their organs and the spirit not residing in its abode, allowing for illness caused by sinister energies. The signs include a reluctance to be seen by others; one may laugh alone at times, or weep unexpectedly. Their pulse may be soft and slow, or resemble a bird pecking, both indicating illness caused by malign spirits. Furthermore, if the pulse is continuous and indistinct, the complexion lacking harmony, this is also indicative. In the past, there have been effective treatments recorded in texts, and they are not misleading. Additionally, for widows and nuns who encounter such influences in dreams, and whose maladies have lingered, one may use Fu Shen Powder and Peach Kernel Pill to treat them.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>On Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Human beings are endowed with the vital energies of the Five Elements; when these energies are proper, they are correct, and when they are distorted, they lead to corruption. When the energy is strong, the spirit thrives; when it is weak, phantoms arise. As discussed in the treatise on acupuncture: when the spirit loses its rightful position, external evil spirits intrude, which is of this nature. </p>
<p>There are two types of dreams experienced by women that involve evil: one arises from desires and perverse thoughts, disturbing the mind and leading to dreams—this is where phantoms emerge from the heart and do not involve external intrusion; the other occurs when one&#39;s constitution is not pure, allowing external evils to penetrate, thus daring to infringe upon the individual. Both forms of external evil do exist. </p>
<p>The causes of illness can be internal or external, resulting in different symptoms. When illness originates from within, there are no external signs, but in dreams and sleep, one may frequently encounter disturbances, leading to symptoms like loss of consciousness or a muddled state, which is akin to nocturnal emissions in men, the mechanism being similar, yet women are often reluctant to speak of it.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>As for external disturbances from evil entities, their symptoms are different. Some may exhibit unpredictable laughter or joy in solitude, preferring not to see others, or may weep for no reason while showing no change in facial expression. Others may have a blush like peach blossoms; their pulse may be erratic, sometimes sparse, sometimes rapid, with intervals not consistent. Alternatively, it may sink, be short and knotty, or thin and stringy, or have an irregular rhythm. These are all signs of malevolent influences. </p>
<p>In either case, if there is a failure in regulation and it persists over time without healing, then the essence and blood will diminish day by day, the true yin will be lost over time, leading to tidal fevers, fatigue of spirit and body, reduced appetite, dryness in the mouth, and atrophy of muscles, gradually resulting in exhaustion, with a pulse that becomes tight and rapid, often leading to hopelessness.</p>
<p>For treatment, although the causes may vary, the damage to essence and blood is the same. Therefore, for ailments centered in the heart, one should prioritize calming the mind, then treat the illness with appropriate medicine. For those agitated in spirit, it is essential to stabilize their mind and set their intention. For those with weakened essence, strengthen their essence and nourish their yin, especially by nurturing the spleen and kidneys to support vitality. </p>
<p>If afflicted by malevolent spirits, one should internally regulate and restore the vital energy, using formulations similar to Gui Shen Tang; externally, one should quickly moxa the Gui Ku穴 (Ghost Cry point) to drive away the evil qi, which should lead to gradual healing.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Fang</p>

If urgent, even seven days is sufficient. In cloudy weather, dry with fire. Mix the six ingredients uniformly and fill a sand box such that it contains about three parts, according to the size of the box. First, use powdered red stone resin to seal the seams, and apply six-one clay on the exterior until sealing is complete. Allow it to dry thoroughly, selecting a clear auspicious day. Make three pillars of clay, each five inches tall, to support it evenly like tripod feet. Place the box down and put three sheng of charcoal beneath it, gradually adding charcoal up to five jin, ensuring it only fills the bottom and does not exceed the opening. Calcine for five days, let cool, then immerse the box in water. Once the clay is dry, gently remove the clay, and the essence of the medicine in five colors will be on the lid, along with some three-colored ones. Pure white is the best.

<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Regulations on Evidence and Treatment&quot; states: When a woman dreams of intercourse with a ghost, her pulse fluctuates in size, irregular in length, and she should be treated at the Ghost Cry point. For patients, bind the thumbs of both hands closely together with thread, so as to fit in the seam between flesh and nail, and cauterize with seven moxibustion burns. If indeed afflicted by evil spirits, the patient may plead for exemption from moxibustion, saying: &quot;I will leave of my own accord.&quot; </p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue&quot; states: For a woman dreaming of intercourse with a ghost, apply moxibustion to the Ghost Cry point. Bind the thumbs of both hands together, and use mugwort cones to moxibustion at the junction of the nail and flesh, ensuring that both nails ignite with flesh all around. This may require either seven moxibustions or fourteen. The big toes are also referred to as the &quot;Ghost Eyes of the Feet.&quot;<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Rituals of Confucianism and Parent-Child Relationships&quot; states: A woman, thirty-four years old, had dreams at night involving ghosts and spirits. She experienced intense fear and witnessed temples of deities and ghostly realms, with boats and bridges. This continued for fifteen years, and she failed to conceive. She sought help from shamans, priests, and performed rituals, exhausting all means; she endured painful treatments, with countless needles piercing her skin. She was emaciated, feverish, had excessive thirst, and suffered from swollen feet. Upon examining her pulse, it was found that both wrists had a deep and suppressed pulse, indicating phlegm accumulation in her stomach. This showed that there was excessive yang fire above and excessive yin water below. Ghosts and spirits represent the essence of yin; temples represent the dwelling of yin; and boats and bridges represent the use of water. With both wrists showing a deep and suppressed pulse, it indicated that there was phlegm in the chest as well. After three bouts of purging, sweating, and releasing, she experienced no more dreams within ten days and conceived after a month.</p>

<li><p><strong>Porygon Powder:</strong> Two and a half qian of Alisma, one and a half qian each of red Poria, white Atractylodes, and Polyporus, five fen of Cinnamon. Grind to a powder, and take two qian with warm water. Alternatively, it can be made into a paste and decocted in water for consumption.</p>

<li><p><strong>Four Substances Decoction:</strong> For women experiencing urinary incontinence with a morbid pulse, modify this formula as needed. Three qian of cooked Rehmannia, one qian each of Peony, Dong Quai, and Chuanxiong. Prepare with water for oral consumption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medical Cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In &quot;Xin Fa&quot; by Zhu Zhenheng: A woman had a strong liking for alcohol and frequently drank heavily without becoming drunk. Suddenly, she experienced a discharge from the front and urination from the back. All six pulses were deep and slippery. She was treated with Four Substances Decoction, adding Sea Mustard, Wood Fragrance, Betel Nut, Akebia, and Peach Kernel, resulting in recovery. This woman had excessive alcohol causing the energy to rise without descending, leading to a deficient yang; prolonged alcohol consumption accumulated dampness and generated heat, disrupting her blood, resulting in significant yin deficiency. Both yin and yang were depleted but she temporarily survived due to her physical constitution, as the residual energy of grains in the alcohol remained. She was bound to die within three months—this was indeed the case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: A woman, after recovering from illness, experienced feces in her urine, indicating a disruption in the transmission of yin and yang, known as the intersection of the large and small intestines. She was treated with Wuling Powder twice and recovered, followed by the use of Middle Benefiting Qi Decoction for stabilization.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>The &quot;Meaningful Weeds&quot; states: Jiang Yiren obtained a rare testimony, reading the &quot;Bencao Jing Shu&quot; (Commentary on the Materia Medica) on the use of Wuling in treating intestinal exchanges, which he viewed as mysterious. I, however, distinguished it by saying: the symptom of intestinal exchange involves the reversal of large and small excretions, akin to a trade. In ancient times, Wuling San was used to treat this, specifically designed for facilitating the anterior passage. If this symptom is restricted in the posterior passage, and both excretions come from the anterior passage, it is indeed reminiscent of intestinal exchange; yet, there lies a truth within the false. Moreover, intestinal exchange is an acute condition, suddenly causing chaotic Qi within; while this symptom is a chronic illness, gradually leading to blood depletion internally, with a difference as vast as a hair’s breadth to a thousand miles. How can one equate them?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The origin of disease begins with anxiety and worry, which injures the spleen, as the spleen governs blood. If the spleen is damaged, it cannot oversee the flow, allowing for false descent akin to hemorrhaging, which is called &quot;losing nourishment.&quot; This condition requires urgent, substantial nourishment, yet it is mistakenly treated as hemorrhaging, with cooling blood and clearing fire, leading to excessive discharge. One fails to consider that the heavenly essence is exhausted, the tides have ceased, and this sickness is nonexistent. As the years advance, Qi weakens, and with no blood to fill the vessel, one thinks nothing of it. Consequently, the blood at the entrances of the womb gradually diminishes, inevitably needing to draw resources from elsewhere. It borrows from the large intestine, causing the blood of the large intestine to be transported and seep into the pouch. Over time, the blood of the large intestine is also depleted. Moreover, the Qi of the large intestine, reliant on the blood, becomes isolated and aimless, rushing and scattering chaotically, akin to the disasters faced by trees and fish in water.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>Similar to those who assist in times of famine, they strip the neighboring countries of their resources, disregarding the consequences. Yet even that is not enough; it ultimately affects the stomach, transforming the blood within it, pulling and seeping into the bag of the body. After a long time, the blood of the stomach is also depleted, and the blood flow ceases without a source. The blood of the stomach is what nourishes the entire body and fills the hundred vessels; if it now returns to nothingness, then the grains lose their moisture and millet becomes a cause for concern. When the blood is exhausted and stops, it is far worse compared to when the blood remains but flows away. Therefore, when the blood runs out, then the vital energy becomes chaotic; when the vital energy is chaotic, food and drink cannot be properly processed, leading to narrow passages instead of wide ones, and both the Yangtze and Han rivers converge into one, causing great disorder within the body. This will inevitably reopen the pathways of the large intestine, allowing for resolution and treatment, and the formula of Wuling does not interfere at all. Moreover, as food and drink move from the stomach into the intestines, the pylorus separates the clear from the turbid. Now, due to the seepage of blood, it has formed a channel for the grains, and the pylorus has become an open pathway; can Wuling still be used to reopen it? Furthermore, the obstruction caused by Wuling is strictly cautioned against in cases of significant blood loss. When encountering a single ailment, one often prescribes a single remedy without understanding, and those who uphold fixed formulas as sacred secrets generally lead people astray. As for a person’s illness, if one feels three fingers below and asks: &quot;Is there much crying?&quot; and the maidservant replies: &quot;Tears drop frequently,&quot; it indicates that the organs are dry, and thus the large intestine becomes inactive. What about the small intestine? Now, the pulse of the large intestine appears prominently in the fingers, signaling a time of concern. Will spring leaves of jujubes emerge? When the jujube leaves sprout, there will also be fruit as evidence.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han Dynasty, Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms of Genital Issues</strong></p>
<p>When the Shaoyin pulse is slippery and rapid, sores will form in the genitalia. For necrotic sores within, wash with wolf tooth decoction. For women with cold in the genitals, administer warming medicines internally, with the main remedy being the snake bed seed powder. When stomach qi descends and the genitalia emit gas, this indicates excess from consumed food; administer the gao fa decoction to guide it.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Classic</strong> (Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe)</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>A rapid Shaoyin pulse indicates qi stagnation with sores in the genitalia. For women, if the Shaoyin pulse is taut, it indicates an intestinal blockage. If a woman’s abdomen swells like a gourd, with pain radiating to the lower back, administer the apricot kernel decoction. If the Shaoyin pulse is floating and dynamic, this indicates a state of deficiency; if floating, it is deficient, and if dynamic, it indicates pain—women may experience a loss of discharge. The master states: if the pulse feels floating and tight, it signifies pain in the body; if there is no pain, then this should be treated. Why is treatment necessary? It means there is pain in the intestines, rumbling in the abdomen, or coughing due to loss of bowel movement. If a woman presents this pulse, she should undergo treatment for gas emission. The master states: if the pulse at the inch is floating and weak, floating suggests deficiency. Weak signifies lack of blood; floating denotes shortness of breath, while weakness indicates heat and spontaneous sweating. The fuyang pulse is floating and slippery; floating suggests fullness of qi, while slippery indicates coldness, with a preference for burping and sour ingestion, as the qi fails to descend, causing a chill in the lower abdomen. The Shaoyin pulse that is weak and fine indicates insufficient blood, weakness provokes wind, and the weak and fine pulses clash, causing discomfort with coldness in the genitalia, stomach qi descends, emitting gas, resulting in a clamorous condition.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion on Yin Diseases</strong>  </p>
<p>When a woman&#39;s Yin descends and prolapses, it may be due to damage to the uterine vessels, deficiency and coldness of the internal organs, or excessive effort during childbirth.<br><strong>[Note: In such cases, the primary treatment should focus on replenishing the original Qi.

<p>For women experiencing itching in the Yin area, this is often caused by three pests residing in the intestines and stomach, which erode the Yin due to organ deficiency. If mild, it leads to itching; if severe, it results in pain.<br><strong>[Note: This condition belongs to the transformation of the liver channel, and one should use the Dragon Gallbladder Decoction and the Happy Powder for internal treatment. Externally, a paste made from powdered peach kernels and realgar, or using chicken liver inserted into the Yin area, may be employed to suppress these pests.]</strong><br><strong>[Referring to the &quot;Great Compendium&quot;: The activity of the three pests occurs within the Yin, creating heat; mild cases present with itching, while severe cases cause pain.]</strong>  </p>
<p>If a woman&#39;s Shaoyin pulse is rapid and slippery, there may be sores in the Yin, known as the &quot;hidden lower pests.&quot; Symptoms may include pain or itching, resembling the movement of pests, with pus and moisture running out. In severe instances, the Yin may be nearly eroded. This is all due to a disturbed heart spirit and weakened spleen and stomach, leading to stagnant Qi and blood. Internally, one should nourish the heart and strengthen the stomach, while using medicinal washes externally for treatment.<br><strong>[Note: The aforementioned condition indicates liver and spleen stagnation; an excess of wood leads to pest formation, necessitating the resolution of stagnation and clearing of the liver.]</strong>  <a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>If something prostrudes like a mushroom or a cockscomb, accompanied by swelling and pain around it, this indicates liver stagnation and spleen deficiency. First, use &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction,&quot; adding gardenia, poria, plantago seeds, and green tangerine peel to clear the liver fire and gradually boost the spleen qi; then, use &quot;Gui Pi Decoction&quot; with added gardenia, poria, and chuanxiong for adjustment, applying licorice and artemisia ointment externally. </p>
<p>If the yin orifice protrudes due to strenuous activity, it suggests blood deficiency; use &quot;Four Substances Decoction&quot; with added dragon bone. If it&#39;s qi deficiency, use &quot;Buzhong Yiqi Decoction.&quot; </p>
<p>If insects appear inside (above with hiding insects below) like small maggots, this signifies severe damp-heat and stagnant heart qi leading to the formation. It is advised to take &quot;Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Decoction,&quot; &quot;Bu Xin Decoction,&quot; or &quot;Gulou Liyuan Pill,&quot; and externally use fresh mugwort juice mixed with realgar powder, burn it to produce smoke for inhalation, and further use realgar powder to disperse within the yin. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>First, prepare a decoction of snake bed seeds, clean, and dry; then use powdered dry catalpa bark and mix in one-quarter of dried alum and a small amount of musk to apply, which will take effect immediately. For severe swelling and pain in the lower region with constipation, use bitter orange and tangerine poultice; for swelling and pain alone, take a four-substance decoction with added bupleurum, mountain gardenia, peony root, and gentian. For persistent lower pain, add dry plantain and windproof to the four-substance decoction. For dampness with itching, flowing discharge, and pain due to excessive worry, take the return to spleen decoction with added bupleurum, mountain gardenia, peony root, peony, and raw licorice. </p>
<p>For swelling and pain in the lower region that does not close, use the carefree powder or the ten complete tonics. If the swelling subsides but does not close, take the middle-boosting qi tonic; if the swelling droops, add mountain gardenia and peony root. For lower discomfort without closure, accompanied by cold and heat in urination, fatigue, and reduced appetite, take the middle-boosting qi tonic with added angelica, bupleurum, about three grams, and adjust with poria and mountain gardenia. </p>
<p>If the lower region does not close, with urination that drips, and abdominal distension described as a lump that causes pain, take the carefree powder with added bupleurum, mountain gardenia, and plantago seeds. </p>
<p>For bleeding during intercourse, likely due to trauma, and liver-spleen deficiency leading to inability to retain blood, take the middle-boosting qi tonic. Externally, use prepared moxa wrapped in cloth and inserted into the lower region, or use ashes from charred green peels of various hair.

<p>The Shaoyin pulse is superficial and active; when superficial, it indicates emptiness, and when active, it signifies pain—possibly leading to bleeding or displacement of the yin region. The Shaoyin pulse may be slippery and rapid, indicating possible qi dysuria or sores in the yin region causing pain and itching. If the Shaoyin pulse is faint, it suggests blocked qi in the bladder. In women, this may result in sores in the yin region. A strong pulse is easier to treat, while a weak pulse signifies greater loss.

<p>The internal manifestations include dry mouth and internal heat, fatigue, irregular menstrual cycles, tastelessness in food, afternoon fevers, chest discomfort, hypochondriac fullness, lower abdominal pain and distension, as well as red or white leukorrhea, and painful urination. </p>
<p>Treatment methods: for swelling and pain, it is appropriate to use a combination of Four Herbs with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, Dan Pi; for damp-itching, it is best to use Gui Pi with Shan Zhi, Dan Pi, and Chai Hu; for painful urination, Long Dan Cao San with Bai Zhu and Dan Pi is recommended; for ulceration, add modified Xiao Yao San; for heaviness and fullness, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi with Shan Zhi and Dan Pi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For women suffering from vulvar sores, it is due to damp-heat invading the liver channel. When there are worms in the vulva, the itching is unbearable and if it invades the organs, it can lead to death and cause fever and chills, resembling tuberculosis. Use cooked pig liver, cut into long strips, and while it is hot, place it inside the vulva to expel the worms. The worms will emerge upon sensing the fishy smell; repeat this several times. It is also effective to take herbal medications that drain the liver and nourish the blood.</p>
<p>Itching in the vulva is likewise indicative of damp-heat in the liver; the formula for draining the liver is effective. For thin individuals with dry itching, it pertains to liver yin deficiency, primarily connected to the Kidney and Heart; externally, wash with a decoction of cnidium seeds. (If the worm is hidden, treat the sores similarly by differentiating between deficiency and excess.)</p>
<p>If the pulse is rapid and there are sores in the vulva, after a long time, worms may develop in the lower part; use cooked pig liver cut into long strips inserted into the vulva to draw out the worms, then proceed with medication to kill the worms.</p>
<p>For swollen and painful conditions in the vulva, which a woman cannot endure, if there is a protrusion resembling an eggplant, it is analogous to a man&#39;s hernia, but is referred to as accumulative masses; both belong to the turbid qi of the liver channel. The treatment is to soothe the liver and disperse qi, similar to treating hernia. Externally, chop and stir-fry bitter orange and use it warm in a cloth pouch to apply, changing when it cools. This is effective for all vulval pain.</p>
<p>For pain during a new marriage, it is advisable to soothe the depression and harmonize the blood with a combination of the four substances plus cyperus and safflower.</p>
<p>For women with excessive coldness and heaviness in the vulva, it is often caused by the downward flow of damp phlegm, so use equal parts of Atractylodes and Chen Pi along with herbs to dispel wind; externally, sit in medicated solutions is quite effective.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>By Wang Kentang, Ming Dynasty</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Treatment of Female Conditions</strong></p>
<p>In women, if hemorrhoids occur in the lower region, all protrusions from the nine orifices are termed hemorrhoids. The condition known as “eggplant disease” in women refers to these hemorrhoids, which arise from heart agitation, are easier to treat with yellow liquid, but harder to cure with white liquid. The <em>Good Prescription</em> states: if a woman&#39;s lesser yin pulse is rapid and slippery, there must be sores in the lower region, known as &quot;crawling insect sores,&quot; which may cause pain or itching, resembling the movement of insects. If there is a profuse outflow of fluid and significant erosion, this results from heart distress and weak stomach energy, leading to stagnation of qi and blood. The classics say: all pains and itching sores are associated with the heart. Furthermore, it states that the yangming governs muscles, and both pain and itching are related to the heart. Therefore, treatment should focus on nourishing the heart and stomach, and externally using fumigation and sitting baths with medicinal treatments. </p>
<p>In cases of female sores in the lower region, the condition often pertains to cold. The classics say: an excess of the taiyang leads to sores in the qi, and if the hidden channels are not beneficial, the treatment involves bitter heat. Female sores occur due to the actions and erosion caused by three or nine insects. These insects exist between the intestines and stomach; if the organs are harmonious and blood and qi are sufficient, they cannot cause harm. However, if labor injures the meridians, leading to damage to the intestines and stomach, these insects will invade the lower region, resulting in minor itching or pain, or serious sores. Zhongjing states: if the pulse of the lesser yin is slippery and rapid, there will be sores in the lower region.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Women&#39;s genital ulcers arise from the emotional states causing stagnation of fire, damaging the liver and spleen, and heat and dampness descending as a result. Their forms are indeed various, but all stem from the transformation of pathogenic fire. </p>
<p>If a snake-like shape protrudes about an inch, with heavy water-like symptoms, this indicates sinking spleen energy along with sweating fire. In the morning, take a tonic to nourish the center and boost qi, and in the evening, take a Dragon Gallbladder Decoction to drain the liver. Apply a powder of realgar and rhododendron externally, and the condition will gradually improve. </p>
<p>If the protrusion resembles a fungus or a chicken comb, and is swollen and painful around the edges, this results from liver stagnation and spleen deficiency. Start by using a tonic to nourish the center and boost qi, adding gardenia, poria, and citrus peel to clear the liver and supplement the spleen, while also raising central qi. Furthermore, use a Gui Pi Decoction with gardenia, ligusticum, poria, cyperus, and dried tangerine peel for regulation.</p>
<p>If the genital area suddenly swells and becomes painful, it may be due to labor injury to the blood system and damp fire flowing downwards; treat it with a Four Substance Decoction adding moutan, alisma, pollen, and bupleurum. </p>
<p>If there are parasites like small maggots within (hidden upper and lower), this indicates heart qi stagnation transformed by pathogenic fire; use the Four Substance Decoction with berberine, gentian, houttuynia, and acuaticum to unblock and disperse the stagnation in the heart’s orifices. Externally, apply ginkgo powder to the affected area.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there are lumps outside the genitals and fine worms growing inside that cause unbearable itching, these worms, once they invade the organs, can lead to death, causing intermittent chills and fever, resembling consumption. Women with this condition, out of shame, often refuse to discuss it. Over time, they become emaciated with yellowed skin, experiencing chills and fevers, coughing with phlegm, and many go untreated. If this condition arises, promptly administer Xiao Yao San and take Lu Hui pills twice a day. Externally, apply Ginkgo powder wrapped in cotton and insert it into the vagina to kill the worms and relieve itching; improvement will be seen in half a month. If the vagina remains open and does not close, it is due to excessive worry; administer Tong Yao San and Gui Pi Decoction with additional Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, Bai Shao, and Dan Pi taken intermittently. For bleeding during intercourse, it indicates liver deficiency with excess heat unable to store blood; use Si Wu Decoction with Da Zao, Huang Qin, Shan Zhi, and Chai Hu. If there is swelling and pain due to new sexual activity, apply a mixture of pearl powder and pork spinal marrow. Additionally, if a woman remains in a secluded room for a long time, the stagnant fire of desire can lead to this condition; prolonged invasion of this evil fire can cause itching and the production of worms. These worms can corrode the internal organs, leading to pain, foul discharge, dry mouth and heat, and emaciation with refusal to eat. Those with this condition cannot be cured by medicine and will ultimately die. This is also called the loss of harmony syndrome.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Record of the Stone Chamber</strong> <em>(Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo)</em></p>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Methods</strong></p>
<p>If a woman develops worms inside her vagina, it is caused by damp heat. It is effective to use chicken liver in powdered medicine to attract them, but it is even better to use three or four earthworms and a few scallions, dry them over a fire, and powder them. Boil this in a bowl of honey until it forms a paste, then crush the medicine into it and insert it into the vagina; the worms will die and naturally be expelled with urination. </p>
<p>Moreover, if a woman has sores near the vaginal opening that cause constant itching and pain, applying the following prescription as a wash will yield immediate results: use one tael of Chinese lovage, three qian of Sichuan pepper, three qian of alum, and ten bowls of water, then boil down to five bowls. Use the hot liquid for fumigation first, and when it cools, wash with it. One application will stop the itching, two will stop the pain, and within three days, she will fully recover. Split the treatment over five days, and wash once each day for exceptional effectiveness. </p>
<p>A woman may feel embarrassed to discuss her issues, but generally, it is either cold or heat related. There is a prescription involving three qian each of angelica and peony, one qian of Chuanxiong, five qian of cooked rehmannia, one qian each of licorice, chaihu, and white mustard seed, and three fen each of huangqin and roasted ginger, boiled in water. If symptoms improve compared to before, it indicates a deficiency syndrome, which can then be treated with the Four Substance Decoction. If improvement does not occur, it indicates a heat syndrome, and three qian of gardenia can be added to the prescription to ensure effectiveness.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

The &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; states: when the lunar cycle is unfavorable and there are signs of red and white bleeding, it indicates a reversal of health due to cold and dampness. For treatment, perform six punctures at the interstitial areas and apply moxibustion three times at the acupuncture point found between the big toe and the adjacent toe. </p>

<p>For women experiencing absence of menstruation combined with excessive bleeding, puncturing deep into the area for three times and applying moxibustion three times is advised, with the acupuncture point located just in front of the inner ankle bone. </p>

<p>The &quot;Langhuan Memorandum&quot; states: A woman suffered from itching in her private parts, unable to confess to anyone, enduring great distress. She usually revered the statue of Guanyin with utmost sincerity. During her illness, she saw a nun bringing a box of medicine, saying: &quot;Boil this and wash it, and you will be cured.&quot; Suddenly the nun disappeared. Upon inspection, she found it contained snake bed seeds, wu zhu yu (a type of fruit), and bitter gentian.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Guidelines&quot; mentions: A woman suffered from damp sores located below the navel and around her private areas, resembling a horse knife, but without sores elsewhere. She experienced heat, itching, and pain, along with frequent, painful urination and excretion of yellow fluid, as well as decreased appetite and swelling of the body and face. The doctor treated her with remedies for sores, using eel, pine resin, and yellow lead, which exacerbated her heat and pain due to improper treatment. Upon careful inquiry, it was revealed that she had a craving for alcohol and was fond of fish and crabs, which cause wind. She was urgently instructed to wash off the ointments with warm water and then ground four taels of purslane, mixing it with one tael of indigo, and applied it to the sores. Immediately, the heat diminished, and both pain and itching disappeared. She continued to take Ba Zheng Powder, three times a day, to dissipate the excess heat. Each time the medication dried out, fresh damp medicine was reapplied. In this manner, a third of the condition improved in two days, two-thirds improved in five days, and she was completely healed in twenty days. After her recovery, she was asked how this illness occurred. She replied: &quot;It was due to wind-heat toxins accumulating in the lower body, causing gas buildup, potentially leading to intestinal abscesses or hemorrhoids.&quot; She was advised to avoid alcohol and wind-causing substances. Later, unable to refrain from drinking, she did indeed develop internal hemorrhoids.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman experienced itching and pain internally, along with internal heat and fatigue, with reduced appetite and excessive thinking. This was due to liver and spleen stagnation, with vitality depleted and damp-heat accumulation. Treatment included ginseng, astragalus, angelica, poria, tangerine peel, bupleurum, stir-fried gardenia, plantago, silverbell, peony, moutan, and poria, which led to recovery. If there were itching and pain caused by parasites within, it was also associated with the liver; peach kernels and realgar were to be ground and introduced internally to kill them, alongside using herbs to clear the liver and relieve stagnation. Some used chicken liver for this, which was a method to eliminate the parasites.</p>
<p>A woman with swelling and oppression internally, difficult urination, and swelling in the flanks, along with internal heat and periodic chills and fevers, suffered from liver and spleen stagnation, leading to a descent of vitality and damp-heat obstruction. In the morning, she was given Gui Pi Decoction with added bupleurum and silverbell to relieve obstructions, replenish spleen energy, and uplift vitality. In the evening, she received Jia Wei Xiao Yao San to clear liver fire, nourish liver blood, and eliminate damp-heat. After several doses, her various symptoms were resolved; additionally, Four Gentlemen Decoction, as well as cyperus, angelica, and moutan were used to regulate and replenish the liver and spleen, restoring her menstrual cycle as normal.</p>
<p>A woman presented with coldness within, yellow and difficult urination, alternating internal heat and cold, with a bitter mouth and distension in the flanks, resulting from damp-heat in the liver channel. Long Dan Decoction was prescribed to expel and relieve damp-heat, while Jia Wei Xiao Yao San was to adjust and replenish blood energy for stability.</p>
<p>A woman with similar symptoms experienced increased coldness, fever, and vomiting, with swelling and pain in the thighs. Initially, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction was administered with added mountain gardenia, which promptly halted her chills, fever, and vomiting. Then, Long Dan Xiao Yao Tang was given, leading to an immediate reduction in swelling and pain.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another woman had bleeding during intercourse, accompanied by pain and fever, along with thirst and nausea. She took cold herbs, which worsened her symptoms, causing frequent nausea, a diminished appetite, and progressive weight loss. I said this was due to liver heat injuring the spleen.

<p>A woman presented with swelling and heaviness in her lower region, with painful sensations and water discharge, and discomfort in her chest and abdomen. She had frequent urination, internal heat, afternoon fever, bitterness in her mouth, and tinnitus. This was a case of liver and spleen heat. I prescribed Minor Bupleurum Decoction with plantain, gentian, poria, atractylodes, and summer plantain, which led to slight improvement. I then used the Enhanced Free and Easy Wanderer with several doses of summer plantain, resulting in gradual recovery. Finally, I prescribed the Enhanced Return to Spleen Decoction with added summer plantain and bupleurum, along with the Middle Boosting and Energy Augmenting Decoction with gardenia, and several doses led to complete recovery. I continued to use both the Enhanced Free and Easy Wanderer and the Enhanced Return to Spleen Decoction for further recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman suffered from heat and pain, sometimes taking cold and toxic herbs, resulting in a complete loss of appetite and occasional nausea, along with a heavy feeling in her lower abdomen. I concluded this was due to damage to the spleen and stomach, leading to sinking of vital energy. I first prescribed the Middle Boosting and Energy Augmenting Decoction with roasted ginger for two doses, which quickly alleviated the heaviness. I then added poria and pinellia for over twenty doses, leading to recovery.

However, if the bleeding is excessive, the previous remedies should be adjusted to nourish the liver and spleen.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essential Surgery&quot; states: A woman suffers from wind and dampness flowing down from the liver, causing swelling and severe itching of the vulva, which leads to scratching and bleeding without pain. She was treated with a formula to dispel wind, adding herbs such as Sophora, Gentian, Alisma, Akebia, and Gardenia; externally, she used a wash with Cnidium seed decoction and applied Ginkgo powder. After more than ten days, her itching ceased and swelling reduced, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman, a widow for over ten years, experienced itching and parasitic infestation in her genital region, bearing it in silence. Gradually, the area became ulcerated, having even eroded into her internal organs. She appeared emaciated, with fever and thirst, her pulse superficial and rapid. Only then did she seek medical treatment. Upon inquiry, it was revealed that she had long endured itching and pain, with the vulva blackened and rotten. Her urinary incontinence indicated that her internal organs were irreparably damaged, ruling out the possibility of medication. Desperate for a cure, I stated: &quot;The itching is caused by parasites, while the pain indicates damage.&quot; Initially, I used several crucian carp mixed with spices, and once cooked, wrapped them in fine cotton, inserting them into her genital area for a long time. Upon extraction, I found red worms measuring up to an inch, with some shorter, about five to six tenths of an inch long, fine like cotton, totaling over twenty worms. They were placed in warm water and only died after some time. Her family rejoiced, believing she could be cured. I countered: &quot;Not so. They will continue to multiply.&quot; If she forcefully took tonics to nourish blood and clear the liver, she would ultimately not recover and die.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

It is advisable to use calming and stabilizing medications to restore upright qi, allowing the spirit to find peace.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Remarkable Efficacy and Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Fang Xian]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overview of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Human beings possess five internal organs, within which reside seven spirits. They are born from the quintessence of the five elements, reliant on divine energy for sustenance. When yin and yang are harmonious, the organs and bowels thrive, and malevolent spirits cannot inflict harm. However, if the regulation is disrupted and vital energy weakens, evil spirits can invade, leading to disturbances. This is why women frequently encounter malevolent spirits in their dreams—due to the weakness of their organs and the spirit not residing in its abode, allowing for illness caused by sinister energies. The signs include a reluctance to be seen by others; one may laugh alone at times, or weep unexpectedly. Their pulse may be soft and slow, or resemble a bird pecking, both indicating illness caused by malign spirits. Furthermore, if the pulse is continuous and indistinct, the complexion lacking harmony, this is also indicative. In the past, there have been effective treatments recorded in texts, and they are not misleading. Additionally, for widows and nuns who encounter such influences in dreams, and whose maladies have lingered, one may use Fu Shen Powder and Peach Kernel Pill to treat them.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Diagnosis and Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Human beings are endowed with the vital energies of the Five Elements; when these energies are proper, they are correct, and when they are distorted, they lead to corruption. When the energy is strong, the spirit thrives; when it is weak, phantoms arise. As discussed in the treatise on acupuncture: when the spirit loses its rightful position, external evil spirits intrude, which is of this nature. </p>
<p>There are two types of dreams experienced by women that involve evil: one arises from desires and perverse thoughts, disturbing the mind and leading to dreams—this is where phantoms emerge from the heart and do not involve external intrusion; the other occurs when one&#39;s constitution is not pure, allowing external evils to penetrate, thus daring to infringe upon the individual. Both forms of external evil do exist. </p>
<p>The causes of illness can be internal or external, resulting in different symptoms. When illness originates from within, there are no external signs, but in dreams and sleep, one may frequently encounter disturbances, leading to symptoms like loss of consciousness or a muddled state, which is akin to nocturnal emissions in men, the mechanism being similar, yet women are often reluctant to speak of it.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block original">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>至若外有邪犯者，其证则异，或言笑不常，如有对晤，或喜幽寂，不欲见人，或无故悲泣而面色不变，或面带桃花，其脉息则乍疏乍数，三五不调，或伏沉，或促结，或弦细，或代易不常，是皆妖邪之候。凡此二者，若失于调理，久之不愈，则精血日败，真阴日损，乃致潮热发热，神疲体倦，饮食日减，经水口枯，肌肉消削，渐成劳损，脉见紧数，多致不救矣。凡治此者，所因虽有不同，而伤精败血，其病则一。故凡病坐于心者，当先以静心为主，然后因其病而药之。神动者安其神定其志，精滑者固其精养其阴，尤当以培补脾肾，要约门户，以助生气为主。若为妖魅所侵，则内当调补正气，如归神汤之类；外宜速灸鬼哭穴，以驱邪气，则自当渐愈。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>As for external disturbances from evil entities, their symptoms are different. Some may exhibit unpredictable laughter or joy in solitude, preferring not to see others, or may weep for no reason while showing no change in facial expression. Others may have a blush like peach blossoms; their pulse may be erratic, sometimes sparse, sometimes rapid, with intervals not consistent. Alternatively, it may sink, be short and knotty, or thin and stringy, or have an irregular rhythm. These are all signs of malevolent influences. </p>
<p>In either case, if there is a failure in regulation and it persists over time without healing, then the essence and blood will diminish day by day, the true yin will be lost over time, leading to tidal fevers, fatigue of spirit and body, reduced appetite, dryness in the mouth, and atrophy of muscles, gradually resulting in exhaustion, with a pulse that becomes tight and rapid, often leading to hopelessness.</p>
<p>For treatment, although the causes may vary, the damage to essence and blood is the same. Therefore, for ailments centered in the heart, one should prioritize calming the mind, then treat the illness with appropriate medicine. For those agitated in spirit, it is essential to stabilize their mind and set their intention. For those with weakened essence, strengthen their essence and nourish their yin, especially by nurturing the spleen and kidneys to support vitality. </p>
<p>If afflicted by malevolent spirits, one should internally regulate and restore the vital energy, using formulations similar to Gui Shen Tang; externally, one should quickly moxa the Gui Ku穴 (Ghost Cry point) to drive away the evil qi, which should lead to gradual healing.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To prepare the medicine, fry realgar oil for seven days. For the orpiment, vermilion, and azure mineral, take one tael each. For gold tooth mineral, use six qian. Grind these finely. Soak the male and female orpiment and vermilion in vinegar for three days. Soak the azure mineral in good wine within a copper vessel. Seal with paper and expose it to the sun for a hundred days. If urgent, even seven days is sufficient. In cloudy weather, dry with fire. Mix the six ingredients uniformly and fill a sand box such that it contains about three parts, according to the size of the box. First, use powdered red stone resin to seal the seams, and apply six-one clay on the exterior until sealing is complete. Allow it to dry thoroughly, selecting a clear auspicious day. Make three pillars of clay, each five inches tall, to support it evenly like tripod feet. Place the box down and put three sheng of charcoal beneath it, gradually adding charcoal up to five jin, ensuring it only fills the bottom and does not exceed the opening. Calcine for five days, let cool, then immerse the box in water. Once the clay is dry, gently remove the clay, and the essence of the medicine in five colors will be on the lid, along with some three-colored ones. Pure white is the best. Grind finely, shaping into jujube-sized pills. Take one pill with rice water. When the mouth is closed and teeth clenched, swallow it with the front two teeth to restore vitality.</p>
<p>For the six-one clay method, wrap alum stone in yellow clay, burn it once, then grind finely. Earthworm dung, alkali, and yellow alum, when viewed from a distance, appear golden with brilliance. Its base color is green. Wrap in yellow clay, burn until it turns red like blood, then take out and grind finely. Use one tael of salt and one jin of yellow clay, grind these into powder, and mix with paper to form a cohesive clay.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Single Prescription</strong></p>
<p>When a woman communicates with evil spirits, she speaks and laughs alone, feeling melancholic and dazed: Take one ounce of realgar powder and two ounces of pine resin, mix them together, and use a tiger&#39;s claw to stir until it forms small pellets. At night, burn this mixture in a fire lantern, allowing the woman to sit on it covered, exposing only her head and eyes. If she does not heal after this, repeat it, but only for three doses. </p>
<p>Another prescription: Mix benzoin with stinking yellow to form pellets, burn and fumigate the dantian point for a complete cure.</p>
<p>If a woman dreams of intercourse with a ghost: Grind deer antler into powder, take three finger pinches and mix with clear wine, then consume it to expel the ghost&#39;s essence. This also treats continual leakage.</p>
<p>When a woman is enchanted or possessed by a spirit, bewildered and unwilling to describe her condition: Use water to swallow a thumb-sized deer antler chip, and she will speak the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Regulations on Evidence and Treatment&quot; states: When a woman dreams of intercourse with a ghost, her pulse fluctuates in size, irregular in length, and she should be treated at the Ghost Cry point. For patients, bind the thumbs of both hands closely together with thread, so as to fit in the seam between flesh and nail, and cauterize with seven moxibustion burns. If indeed afflicted by evil spirits, the patient may plead for exemption from moxibustion, saying: &quot;I will leave of my own accord.&quot; </p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Works of Jingyue&quot; states: For a woman dreaming of intercourse with a ghost, apply moxibustion to the Ghost Cry point. Bind the thumbs of both hands together, and use mugwort cones to moxibustion at the junction of the nail and flesh, ensuring that both nails ignite with flesh all around. This may require either seven moxibustions or fourteen.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Rituals of Confucianism and Parent-Child Relationships&quot; states: A woman, thirty-four years old, had dreams at night involving ghosts and spirits. She experienced intense fear and witnessed temples of deities and ghostly realms, with boats and bridges. This continued for fifteen years, and she failed to conceive. She sought help from shamans, priests, and performed rituals, exhausting all means; she endured painful treatments, with countless needles piercing her skin. She was emaciated, feverish, had excessive thirst, and suffered from swollen feet. Upon examining her pulse, it was found that both wrists had a deep and suppressed pulse, indicating phlegm accumulation in her stomach. This showed that there was excessive yang fire above and excessive yin water below. Ghosts and spirits represent the essence of yin; temples represent the dwelling of yin; and boats and bridges represent the use of water. With both wrists showing a deep and suppressed pulse, it indicated that there was phlegm in the chest as well. After three bouts of purging, sweating, and releasing, she experienced no more dreams within ten days and conceived after a month.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In &quot;Xin Fa&quot; by Zhu Zhenheng: A woman had a strong liking for alcohol and frequently drank heavily without becoming drunk. Suddenly, she experienced a discharge from the front and urination from the back. All six pulses were deep and slippery. She was treated with Four Substances Decoction, adding Sea Mustard, Wood Fragrance, Betel Nut, Akebia, and Peach Kernel, resulting in recovery. This woman had excessive alcohol causing the energy to rise without descending, leading to a deficient yang; prolonged alcohol consumption accumulated dampness and generated heat, disrupting her blood, resulting in significant yin deficiency. Both yin and yang were depleted but she temporarily survived due to her physical constitution, as the residual energy of grains in the alcohol remained. She was bound to die within three months—this was indeed the case.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Meaningful Weeds&quot; states: Jiang Yiren obtained a rare testimony, reading the &quot;Bencao Jing Shu&quot; (Commentary on the Materia Medica) on the use of Wuling in treating intestinal exchanges, which he viewed as mysterious. I, however, distinguished it by saying: the symptom of intestinal exchange involves the reversal of large and small excretions, akin to a trade. In ancient times, Wuling San was used to treat this, specifically designed for facilitating the anterior passage. If this symptom is restricted in the posterior passage, and both excretions come from the anterior passage, it is indeed reminiscent of intestinal exchange; yet, there lies a truth within the false. Moreover, intestinal exchange is an acute condition, suddenly causing chaotic Qi within; while this symptom is a chronic illness, gradually leading to blood depletion internally, with a difference as vast as a hair’s breadth to a thousand miles. How can one equate them?</p>
<p>The origin of disease begins with anxiety and worry, which injures the spleen, as the spleen governs blood. If the spleen is damaged, it cannot oversee the flow, allowing for false descent akin to hemorrhaging, which is called &quot;losing nourishment.&quot; This condition requires urgent, substantial nourishment, yet it is mistakenly treated as hemorrhaging, with cooling blood and clearing fire, leading to excessive discharge. One fails to consider that the heavenly essence is exhausted, the tides have ceased, and this sickness is nonexistent. As the years advance, Qi weakens, and with no blood to fill the vessel, one thinks nothing of it. Consequently, the blood at the entrances of the womb gradually diminishes, inevitably needing to draw resources from elsewhere. It borrows from the large intestine, causing the blood of the large intestine to be transported and seep into the pouch. Over time, the blood of the large intestine is also depleted. Moreover, the Qi of the large intestine, reliant on the blood, becomes isolated and aimless, rushing and scattering chaotically, akin to the disasters faced by trees and fish in water.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Similar to those who assist in times of famine, they strip the neighboring countries of their resources, disregarding the consequences. Yet even that is not enough; it ultimately affects the stomach, transforming the blood within it, pulling and seeping into the bag of the body. After a long time, the blood of the stomach is also depleted, and the blood flow ceases without a source. The blood of the stomach is what nourishes the entire body and fills the hundred vessels; if it now returns to nothingness, then the grains lose their moisture and millet becomes a cause for concern. When the blood is exhausted and stops, it is far worse compared to when the blood remains but flows away. Therefore, when the blood runs out, then the vital energy becomes chaotic; when the vital energy is chaotic, food and drink cannot be properly processed, leading to narrow passages instead of wide ones, and both the Yangtze and Han rivers converge into one, causing great disorder within the body. This will inevitably reopen the pathways of the large intestine, allowing for resolution and treatment, and the formula of Wuling does not interfere at all. Moreover, as food and drink move from the stomach into the intestines, the pylorus separates the clear from the turbid. Now, due to the seepage of blood, it has formed a channel for the grains, and the pylorus has become an open pathway; can Wuling still be used to reopen it? Furthermore, the obstruction caused by Wuling is strictly cautioned against in cases of significant blood loss. When encountering a single ailment, one often prescribes a single remedy without understanding, and those who uphold fixed formulas as sacred secrets generally lead people astray. As for a person’s illness, if one feels three fingers below and asks: &quot;Is there much crying?&quot; and the maidservant replies: &quot;Tears drop frequently,&quot; it indicates that the organs are dry, and thus the large intestine becomes inactive. What about the small intestine? Now, the pulse of the large intestine appears prominently in the fingers, signaling a time of concern. Will spring leaves of jujubes emerge? When the jujube leaves sprout, there will also be fruit as evidence.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>
