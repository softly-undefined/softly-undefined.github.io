<p><strong>Pediatric Dysentery</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hejian&#39;s Six Writings (By Liu Wanshu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Children suffering from spleen dysfunction and dysentery have significant heat. Sudden shock can cause dysentery with a greenish color, indicating heat as a proving factor. What about yellow dysentery? It arises when fire is excessive, causing water to decline and spleen function to be strong, leading to yellow dysentery. If the dysentery is red, it signifies deep heart fire, indicating severe heat; if the dysentery is black, it results from extreme heat where it combines with water&#39;s transformative effects, causing a black color.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>Confucianism and Caring for Parents by Zhang Congzheng</h3>
<h4>Dysentery</h4>
<p>For children suffering from prolonged diarrhea, particularly around eight or nine months, it is often due to deep autumn-related cold dysentery, characterized by greenish-white diarrhea and occasional painful cramps. If there are unresolved milk phlegm issues, you may use Yin Pi Wan (Spleen Nourishing Pills) the size of a millet grain, taking 20 to 30 pills each time, washed down with rice drink, administered three times a day for recovery. Additionally, Yiyuang (a medicinal herb) can also be used.</p>
<h4>Complete Medical Book for Infants by Zhu Zhenheng</h4>
<h4>Dysentery</h4>
<p>Dysentery, regardless of being red or white, is associated with damp-heat. Some may mistakenly perceive the white type as cold; this is incorrect. It can also occur due to food accumulation. Treatment involves both strengthening and purging therapies. In cases of dysentery, whether red or white, both dampness and heat are usually present. However, hot conditions feature abdominal pain, while damp conditions do not cause pain. </p>
<p>For red dysentery, damp-heat injures the blood aspect, coming from the small intestine. The treatment method is to use Si Wu Decoction with the addition of Huang Lian (Coptis), Huang Qin (Scutellaria), and Huang Bai (Phellodendron). For white dysentery, damp-heat injures the qi aspect, coming from the large intestine. The treatment method is to use Si Jun Zi Decoction with the addition of Huang Lian and Cang Zhu (Atractylodes). </p>
<p>For cases of mixed red and white dysentery, both blood and qi have been injured, requiring Ba Zhen Decoction with the addition of Huang Lian, Huang Qin, Huang Bai, Huashi (Talc), and Cang Zhu for treatment. </p>
<p>In these three cases, if the symptoms are severe, add Bing Lang (Areca) and Zhi Ke (Bitter Orange). </p>
<p>For treating dysentery, regardless of color, during the initial phase, if there is urgency followed by heaviness, and abdominal distention with pain, first use San Huang Wan to purge; if severe, use Cheng Qi Decoction, followed by Xiang Lian Wan to supplement.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>For chronic red and white dysentery, when the person is weak and has not previously taken laxatives, if one administers laxatives, the person will feel empty and weak, which is detrimental. If laxatives are not given, the accumulation will not dissipate and recovery will be difficult. One should use Baohuan pills repeatedly for several doses, gauging treatment by the alleviation of abdominal pain; afterwards, use Xianglian pills for adjustment.</p>
<p>In treating dysentery, one must never recklessly use poisonous drugs like ba dou or qian niu; instead, the use of Sanhuang pills is advised.</p>
<p>For dysentery accompanied by fresh blood, the treatment is to use Qingxue pills and take a decoction of plantain herb and roasted old rice, which is remarkably effective.</p>
<p>For white saliva in dysentery that does not stop for a long time, use Guichang pills and take them with a controlled amount of brewed old rice, which is notably effective.</p>
<p>For red and white dysentery that persists for a long time, use Ergeng pills and take them with brewed old rice for immediate effect.</p>
<p>For pure red dysentery in summer, roast Yiyuan powder with talcum powder and add red yeast to make pills, taking them with brewed old rice.</p>
<p>In cases of red and white dysentery with rectal prolapse, this indicates downward energy, so one should lift and support it using Hezhong pills followed by Shengma decoction.</p>
<p>For red and white dysentery with thirst, Bai Zhu powder should be used as the main treatment.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>For those suffering from dysentery with symptoms of red and white diarrhea, vomiting, and loss of appetite, this condition is called &quot;silent mouth dysentery.&quot; If treated with wood fragrance, it will lead to warmth-loss, and if with yam, it will lead to closure. One should use a formula of ginseng, poria, and white atractylodes powder, mixed with decocted rice water, to ease the chest, making the person naturally desire food.</p>
<p>In the case of an infant with this condition, one can use fresh fetal feces, place it in a small ceramic jar, add a little musk and a small amount of mercury, mix well, and store. For a child with silent mouth dysentery, applying this medicine into the eyes two or three times is remarkably effective.</p>
<p>After dysentery has ceased, if there is still fever and weakness, one should use the Jisheng pill. If the dysentery persists for a long time, accompanied by high fever and great thirst, it is untreatable. If the six pulses are rapid and strong, the face is red and the body weak, it is untreatable. If there is vomiting and lack of appetite despite medication, it is untreatable. If the condition has persisted for a long time, resulting in purple blood with clots, it is untreatable. If there is black water resembling dust from a leaking roof, it is untreatable. If dysentery turns into seizures, it is untreatable. If after dysentery, it changes into diarrhea while diet remains normal, it is untreatable. If there is prolonged unquenchable thirst and gradual decrease in food intake, it is untreatable. If the hands and feet are emaciated, and large amounts of flesh are lost, it is untreatable. If there is anal prolapse of an inch that cannot be reduced, it is untreatable.</p>
<p>All the above conditions are long-standing dysentery; those who exhibit these symptoms are beyond help.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The ancestral tradition treats dysentery. Without distinguishing between red and white, one first administers detoxifying pills, then uses Xianglian pills to adjust the condition. </p>
<p>Dysentery was formerly known as &quot;stagnation and diarrhea,&quot; caused by accumulated food and damp heat. Symptoms include bowel sounds and pain, making it hard to find comfort, with urgency and a feeling of heaviness inside without a clear side. Red indicates excessive heat in the small intestine, while white signifies the evil invading the large intestine. Inept physicians mistakenly treat white as cold, using pungent and hot herbs chaotically.</p>
<p>Initially, there are no two methods for treating dysentery, as the secret of Hejian is passed down. The techniques of regulating qi and harmonizing blood should be prioritized, with a focus on obtaining the root without deviation. Once qi is activated, the feeling of heaviness will cease, and the movement of blood must calm the dysentery. Avoid spicy and sweet flavors when treating cold and damp conditions, not fearing the passage of years or days.</p>
<p>Generally, one should first administer purgatives such as Huanglian, Zhikua, and Binglang. Big Yellow should be steamed with alcohol, with Licorice and Mangxiao used nearby. If red and white dysentery persists for a long time, and the patient is weak and restless, Baohuo pills are the immortal remedy, requiring careful recognition of the illness.</p>
<p>After the evacuation, pain and urgency should be alleviated, followed by a careful analysis of red and white symptoms. For red dysentery, do not exceed the use of the red formula; for white dysentery, it is safe and reliable for the intestines. If red and white symptoms coexist without improvement, Xianglian pills are highly effective. Renowned physicians spread their names across the four seas, achieving prominence atop a brocade crown.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>If encountering a seasonal dysentery, there is no difference in opening the door. Headaches, body heat, and slow sighing are to be feared in times of epidemics. First, use ginseng to dispel toxins, then apply purging methods. However, one must observe the pulse and adjust accordingly, distinguishing weakness from strength before stopping.</p>
<p>If dysentery persists without cessation, the qi stagnates and the intestines become slippery. Urgently administer good medicine to reinforce and stabilize. Ginseng, angelica, and asarum, with black plum, buckwheat husks, and scutellaria. Dried ginger, chebula, red poria, with japonica rice and dried tangerine peel as a guide.</p>
<p>Remember the medicinal items for dysentery—detoxifying with gardenia and scutellaria. The two substances of natron and realgar can promote transformation, while woody and green peels relieve pain. Bitter orange and betel nut for heaviness, and asarum and bupleurum can uplift. Strengthen the intestines with buckwheat husks and chebula, and use alisma and polyporus for smoothness.</p>
<p>If dysentery is untreated, the symptoms will be numerous, with a pulse like a roaring river that must be guarded against. Withheld food leads to vomiting of watery fluids, high fever, thirst, irritability, and abdominal distention. The large orifice fails to contain the spirit, and feces appear like dark dust. Red face, red lips, sunken eyes, the qi is urgent and chaotic, resembling a state of death.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>In spring and autumn months, children are exposed to cold in the morning and evening. The cold air affects their limbs, and if heat cannot be released, it leads to strong heat. If cold air enters the stomach, it causes diarrhea, which may be red or white, appearing several times. Children may have abdominal distension and severe pain from the strong heat, with vigorous and rapid pulses. For those with heat, it is advisable to administer a regulating decoction; when the heat in the stools subsides, the diarrhea will also resolve. However, those with strong heat who do not vomit or have diarrhea should also take it. </p>
<p>Additionally, in the summer months and early autumn, if exposed to sudden cold amidst intense heat, the body cannot disperse it, leading to internal turmoil. If it manifests externally, it results in malaria; if internally, it leads to diarrhea. When both conditions arise, malaria and diarrhea occur simultaneously, caused by disharmony in the protective and nutritive Qi, and weakness in the intestines and stomach, permitting cold and hot air to invade. This can also be due to dietary harm from unregulated cold and heat, where combined cold yields white, and combined heat yields red stools. If cold and heat attack together, pus and blood will be mixed; it can also be caused by accumulated heat resulting in red diarrhea, and accumulated cold resulting in white diarrhea, resulting in confusion between red and white and the accumulation of both cold and heat.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach qi, and they cannot digest food, then waste does not gather; or in spring, if released from discomfort, if harmed by cold winds, the intestines and stomach may weaken, and suddenly be afflicted by wind and cold, resulting in frequent diarrhea. The classics say: &quot;If harmed by wind in spring, summer will certainly have diarrhea.&quot; For this, a formula regulating the middle can be used, removing rhubarb and adding bitter orange. If diarrhea does not stop, add yellow bitter to treat it. For sudden diarrhea, use powdered plantago seed, mixed with rice drink, which is also effective. In hot months, use Wuling powder or plantago seed powder, mixed with light heart soup; also use a modified version of the Fire-Purging powder. If there are joint diseases of Taiyang and Yangming, there will definitely be diarrhea, for which Gegen decoction is the main treatment. If accompanied by vomiting, add pinellia. Sijunzi decoction is also applicable.</p>
<p>Concerning Various Types of Diarrhea</p>
<p>Diarrhea in children often arises from excessive eating habits, or from eating fruits and meats without knowing when to stop. Thus, the spleen and stomach, still weak, cannot handle it, leading to accumulation in the organs, which causes diarrhea. If heat strikes, it will be red. If wind and cold enter the intestines and stomach, causing the current fluids to stagnate, it will result in white diarrhea. If it is accompanied by greenish discharge, it may be due to fright accumulation; or if it feels very painful in the stomach like brain of fish. Generally, the eight types of diarrhea are only distinguished by heat and cold, red and white. Even though the properties of the medicines may differ, the treatment methods are not far apart. If there is a mix of red and white, first eliminate the heat accumulation by using medicines like rhubarb, bitter orange, and sodium sulfate to remove heat and toxins; then employ yellow bitter, bitter chrysanthemum, and berberine to resolve the heat, thus stopping the diarrhea and alleviating the pain—this is a wonderful method. If the diarrhea does not stop, use prepared ephedra and other medicines for regulation, and it will naturally return to normal.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>For those with spleen deficiency, it is unwise to lightly use substances like grain husks and similar agents, as this could lead to danger and distress. One must use substances like mo stone, huanglian, ejiao, and diyu to stop it, which would be the best approach. The use of zhiqiao and shao yao is also essential. For dysentery with a closed mouth and inability to eat, Shilian San is the principal prescription, and Xiangpu San is also applicable. For cold dysentery with symptoms like abdominal pain akin to bean juice, Weifeng Tang is the remedy. When there is spleen toxin and a hot condition with dysentery, one should often take Xianglian Wan, Huanglian Xiangru Drink, remove Gui from Wuling San, use Maogen Tang, and incorporate Danggui, Shaoyao, Zhiqiao, Diyu, Chuanxiong, and other prescriptions to first detoxify and reduce heat, then to stimulate appetite and consume food, facilitating the drainage of water and grains. To relieve intestinal pain and loosen the bowels, one should first use water-soaked Dan, Baidu San, Diyu Drink, and a laxative mixture with Zhiqiao. In cases of persistent diarrhea with heat, Sanhuang Shun Ai Tang is the main prescription. If there is obstruction due to accumulation, Shenxiong may also be utilized. For severe heat and restlessness, Huanglian Jiedu Tang can resolve the condition, and Pohuosan is also effective.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Medical Overview by Lou Ying</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Pediatric dysentery in children is generally caused by disharmony between the spleen and stomach, overindulgence in inappropriate foods, leading to stagnation that cannot be transformed. Additionally, it can be caused by a wet heat pathogen or by the nursing mother consuming excessive raw or overly rich foods and transmitting these effects. Symptoms arise also from the invasion of pathogenic factors like wind, warmth, and dampness. In cases where there is urgent abdominal pain, the nature of fire is rapid, which can dry out materials. Sometimes, at the end of summer or beginning of autumn, a sudden chill may invade internally without any means of dispersal, leading to conditions like malaria; if both internal and external symptoms manifest, it can result in dysentery-malaria.</p>
<p>If dysentery persists for a long time, it can cause swelling and fullness, with the lower body being colder and the upper body having heat accumulation, resulting in a condition of excess above and deficiency below. In cases where there is damp heat toxicity affecting the spleen, it can lead to a blockage in the stomach, resulting in symptoms like locked jaw. There is also a possibility of family transmission, where the young and old show similar symptoms, indicating an epidemic dysentery. Treatment should first consider the seasonal changes to balance external factors, examine stagnation to regulate internal conditions, carefully assess the nature of injuries, and distinguish between excess and deficiency, as well as hot and cold conditions, to provide effective treatment without arbitrary interventions.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Red and White Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Regarding red and white dysentery, people generally say that red represents Yang and heat, while white represents Yin and cold; some even assert that without accumulation, dysentery cannot occur. However, when it comes to treatment, if one were to alternate between hot and cold medicines or use laxatives to remove accumulation, it would be difficult to achieve effective results. Without understanding the underlying causes, how can one expect to treat it? Moreover, during the changing of the seasons and among various winds, the interplay of the five movements and six atmospheres leads people to suffer from dysentery, particularly in summer and autumn. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: &quot;In spring, one is harmed by wind; in summer, one suffers from diarrhea.&quot; The &quot;Treatise on True Principles&quot; says: &quot;Lesser Yang is in the springs, defeated by excessive fire, causing the populace to suffer from red and white dysentery.&quot; Can one strictly adhere to the idea that without accumulation, dysentery cannot occur? If one only considers accumulation, then is it not the case that during summer and autumn, many suffer from it, while in spring and winter, this is not the same? It is indeed the case that pathogenic wind enters the stomach, where wood can overcome earth. If it does not lead to violent diarrhea, it results in dysentery, characterized by a mixture of red and white, indicating a lack of distinction between Yin and Yang. </p>
<p>The proper method should clarify the distinction between Yin and Yang, using Wuling San to guide the counterflow, and Lirong Tang to warm the stomach, allowing the colors to harmonize before applying treatment. If after this differentiation, red and white continue to descend together, then one must investigate the root cause of the ailment. If white appears first, followed by red, it indicates internal injury from cold, resulting from failing to keep covered, with the primal energy affected by summer heat. The treatment should first save the interior, followed by dispelling the heat toxin. If red appears first and is then followed by white, it indicates that heat has harmed first, followed by loss of coverage leading to cold. The priority should be to relieve the heat, then treat the dysentery.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>If there is a hot dysentery, it will expel pure fresh blood. This condition can cause blood movement, so it is advisable to take cold preparations such as Huanglian Xiangru San, Chuan Cao San, and Danggui San. Additionally, add vinegar and stir-fry steamed cypress leaves, and take it as a decoction with ginger water, or use Qianghuo San combined with Sanhe Decoction, prepared with ginger and millet water.</p>
<p>If there is a cold dysentery, it will expel pure white mucus, or it may appear pale with a hint of pink, or resemble purplish blood like that of a pig&#39;s liver. All these are signs of a yin condition, as cold can obstruct the blood. First, use Wuling San combined with Shouzhong Decoction and decoct it, then follow with Fuzi Lizhong Decoction and take it warm, or use Guzhen Decoction. If one cannot distinguish the deficiencies of yin and yang or the hot and cold conditions and mistakenly administer treatment, it will result in further weakening of the spleen and stomach, leading to an inability to digest food, or may even cause lockjaw dysentery, which is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Additionally, if there is urgency in the abdomen followed by heaviness at the back, it indicates urgency in the yang and heaviness in the yin. Abdominal pain before defecation indicates urgency, while pain after defecation indicates heaviness. Therefore, in cases of urgency, it is due to diarrhea in the large intestine. First, take Daxun Drink combined with Kuangqi Drink for resolution, along with Qianghuo San, prepared with ginger and millet water; then use Kuan Chang Wan. For heaviness, which indicates qi deficiency, combine Wuling San with ginseng and ginger and take as a decoction, and also administer Xianglian Wan. Ifboth conditions occur together, the first two pills can be administered together, or Baijin Drink or Jinsu Wan are also good options. However, diarrhea and dysentery are two distinct conditions: when watery stools mixed with feces are abundant and come easily, it is called diarrhea; when blood-stained white mucus comes in small amounts and is painful, it is called dysentery.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The differentiation of light and heavy, yin and yang, is the basis of treatment methods. When there is a mixture of pus and blood that does not stop for a long time, varying between light during the day and heavy at night, or frequent during both day and night, with reduced appetite and increased pain, one should use Wanjin powder or Shenyxiao powder to address it. </p>
<p>If there is a five-colored diarrhea, it is due to accumulated heat in the five internal organs, persisting for a long time, resulting in this condition. When the five organs receive heat, the nutritive and defensive qi become unbalanced, leading to improper digestion of grains, which corrupts the internal organs, causing the spirit to feel dull. At this point, it is quite dangerous, especially with sharp abdominal pain, and those who are small children have no treatment method. The five colors signify that the colors of the five organs are all visible on the surface. For older children, one may use the standard formula San Shen Wan or Xiao Lai Fu Dan, combined with Wuling powder for administration. If the medicines continue to be ineffective, one should not administer them further.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a wind diarrhea, mostly yellow-brown in color, which closely resembles malnutrition diarrhea but can be distinguished by the lack of foul smell. This wind poison stagnates in the spleen, requiring the removal of wind toxin from the spleen channel, with Xie Huang powder as the main treatment. If one observes both red and white substances being expelled together, and this continues without cessation, along with scant urine, simultaneous pain and heat symptoms, cracked lips and red eyes, shortness of breath with agitation, restlessness in sitting or lying down, extreme thirst for water, and food sinking within the body, combined with periodic facial appearances as if painted, along with lack of appetite, it is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Diarrhea with yellow, red, or black colors indicates heat; while diarrhea with blue or white indicates the inability to digest grains, suggesting cold conditions.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>The East Garden says: The white [discharge] indicates that damp heat injures the qi aspect; the red [discharge] indicates that damp heat injures the blood aspect; when red and white are mixed, both qi and blood are harmed. Haizang employs the Four Gentlemen Decoction, along with Chuanxiong and Angelica to treat weakness-related dysentery, and the Four Gentlemen Decoction with dry ginger for cold-related dysentery. I often treat cases where the hands and feet are hot and the patient drinks cold as real heat, using the Xianglian Pill; for cases where the hands and feet are cold and the patient drinks hot, I consider it virtual cold, employing the Yigong Powder with Xianglian Pill. If there are also symptoms of body heaviness and limb pain, it indicates damp heat injuring the spleen, for which I use the Shengyang Yige Decoction. If urination is not smooth, indicating a lack of distinction between yin and yang, I use the Wuling Powder. If damp heat has subsided but the dysentery persists, it indicates sinking of spleen qi, and I use the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, adding increased doses of Cimicifuga and Bupleurum. For dysentery accompanied by vomiting, or abdominal pain, it indicates spleen and stomach deficiency and cold, so I use the Yigong Powder with prepared ginger and costus. If it transforms into intermittent fever, it indicates liver defeating the spleen, for which I use the Liu Junzi Decoction with Bupleurum and Eclipta. If accumulation and stagnation has been resolved but dysentery continues, it indicates deficiency of spleen qi, and I use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with Xianglian Pill. If the condition is caused by a nursing mother consuming rich and heavy foods, leading the child to illness, one should identify the cause, treat the mother accordingly, and also consider symptoms of heat and cold dysentery, constipation, and abdominal pain. If there are accompanying exterior symptoms, it is necessary to release the exterior. </p>
<p>For the treatment of dysentery, if one wishes to address accumulation, simply use official methods to consume robust pills which can treat accumulation while also alleviating dysentery, ensuring efficacy. Once accumulation has cleared, promptly use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with cardamom and Chebula to replenish, followed by taking thick intestine Xianglian Pills for effectiveness.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Treatment of Dysentery with Cooling Herbs</strong></p>
<p>For treating red dysentery, use the Four Noble Ginsengs with red peony and angelica, and simmer together with a small amount of millet.</p>
<p><strong>Pure Blood Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>According to the teachings of the Chao family: when a child&#39;s dysentery resembles thick blood, this is red dysentery. It comes from extreme intestinal weakness, causing both fat and blood to flow out together. The &quot;Shenghui&quot; states that in children, blood dysentery arises when heat and toxins affect the blood, which then enters the large intestine. The blood circulates along with Qi through the meridians and organs, and there is usually no stagnation. However, if influenced by poisonous heat, and if the intestines are weak where blood seeps into them, this will lead to blood dysentery. The &quot;Baojian&quot; mentions that in children, intestinal heat causes fresh blood to come out during dysentery, similar to intestinal wind.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Cold Dysentery with Warm Herbs</strong><a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>To treat white dysentery, mix equal parts of the Four Gentlemen with dried ginger reduced by half, and add a small amount of millet to cook together.</p>
<p><strong>White Pus Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ying Tong Bao Jian&quot; discusses children&#39;s intestinal cold, which leads to white pus and abdominal pain.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed Pus and Blood Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Sheng Hui&quot; states: for children with pus and blood dysentery, it arises from toxic qi within the organs. When the blood heats up, it overflows and permeates into the large intestine, clashing with the fluids in the intestines, accumulating heat and becoming congealed. The blood transforms into pus; hence, if the abdomen is weak, diarrhea results, leading to pus and blood dysentery. The &quot;Ge Shi Zhu Hou&quot; states: children’s internal toxins stagnate like fish brains.</p>
<p><strong>Five-Color Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Xing Zheng Lun&quot; sings: Five-color dysentery has many manifestations; knowing this, one understands the five types. The blue color signifies shock and accumulation; yellow indicates excess food accumulation in the spleen. White signifies cold weakness in the intestines and stomach; red indicates intense accumulated heat that is difficult to pacify. Chicken liver hidden accumulation forms patches; with mixed black blood, it is hard to stabilize. Lips chapped, chest elevated, exposing teeth; the face red with veins protruding always in front. Urgently pacify the organs with herbal decoctions; physicians must pay attention as the ancient sages taught. </p>
<p>Another song states: Do not regard five-color dysentery as strange; it appears in children under four years old. Blue arises from shock accumulation; yellow from food toxicity in the spleen. Red and black indicate heart and kidney issues; white indicates harm mainly to the spleen. Before the age of three, there is no fluctuation; do not allow excessive sleeping or late meals. </p>
<p>This illness requires harmonizing the five organs and nourishing the defensive and nutritive qi for gradual recovery. If the eyes are swollen and the diet is not improved, only use Ping Wei San for supplementation.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p>
<h3>Gū Lì (Dysentery)</h3>
<p>The &quot;Cháo Shì Bìng Yuán&quot; states: In children, gū poison dysentery occurs when seasonal changes in cold and heat are unregulated, leading to toxic and harmful qi. Children are weakened and hurt by it, with evils clashing against blood and qi, entering the intestines and stomach. Toxic qi accumulates; if the large intestine is vacuous, it transforms into dysentery with blood. The color of the dysentery resembles coagulated blood like pieces of chicken or duck liver, which accompanies the dysentery. This is due to the excess of toxic heat, affecting the internal organs, resembling gū poisoning; hence it is called gū toxin dysentery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Shí Bì Jīng&quot; states that the song of the spleen toxin dysentery goes: &quot;Within the spleen, there is a toxin called pure yang. This is caused by the excessive heat from medicinal herbs hurting the body. It leads to many blockages in the large intestine and to abundant desiccated blood in the shriveled intestines. If the abdomen is windy and closed, it is hard to open one&#39;s eyes. The body heats up, the head feels warm, and the feet turn cold. The tongue is red and the chest is elevated—these are the signs to follow. There is much weeping and shortness of breath, resembling madness. First, one must resolve the heat and open the appetite. This is when good physicians apply their remedies.&quot;</p>
<p>When the spleen suffers from heat accumulation and becomes toxic, the treatment should cool the spleen and then eliminate the accumulation. If the bones in the chest suddenly rise, leading to increased dyspnea, it is not treatable.</p>
<p>The &quot;Fèng Suǐ Jīng&quot; annotation states: It is advisable to take Jīn Huá Sǎn and Xiāng Lián Wán.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xíng Zhèng Lùn&quot; states that the wind toxin dysentery song highlights: &quot;Among the eight types of dysentery, the wind transforms with difficulty, appearing like the thick juice of green grass. The toxic wind mixes with bean juice, adding excessive heat. The stomach is ruined, resembling pieces of chicken liver. There is no need to first purgative the accumulation; closing the eyelids and completely avoiding food is unbearable to see. If it returns to white dysentery, it must be purged. The viscera and bowels should frequently be warmed to restore their original state.&quot;<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>Dysentery with Accompanying Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Chao&#39;s Disease Sources&quot; states: In children, dysentery accompanied by thirst indicates a watery dysentery. When fluids are depleted and the organs are weak and dry, it leads to increased thirst. If urination is frequent, dysentery ceases when thirst is relieved; if urination is scant, and fluids don’t move into the small intestine, but instead seep into the intestines and stomach, thirst persists and dysentery continues. In such cases, the body will appear swollen, as the spleen qi is too weak to manage fluids, leading to eye pain as well. Children generally have heat in the upper burner; now, with dysentery, the lower burner is weak and the upper burner is hot, resulting in excessive qi and heat affecting the liver. Mr. Mao believes food injury to the spleen and stomach is the cause, and suggests starting with &quot;Awakening the Spleen Powder&quot; and &quot;Harmony Qi Powder&quot; for adjustment. After a day, use &quot;Middle-Adjustment Drink&quot; with &quot;Milk Aroma Powder&quot; and &quot;Dragon Spit Paste&quot; to restore health. Alternatively, simply making a juice from winter melon may also help.</p>
<p><strong>Emaciation</strong></p>
<p>Chao states: In children, when the intestines and stomach are weak and affected by wind and cold, it leads to dysentery. After the dysentery resolves, the spleen and stomach remain weak, and qi from grains is still low, resulting in emaciation.</p>
<p><strong>Swelling</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Huiji&quot; discusses the case of children experiencing swelling all over after dysentery. The verse states: &quot;If cold dysentery is untreated for long, widespread swelling occurs as if blown up. A strong pulse indicates qi has turned to water, and firmness arises from accumulations.&quot; The best method is to smooth the qi to reduce swelling; after balancing qi for two days, frequent urination will establish. Avoid overeating to prevent stagnation, as this condition fundamentally stems from the damage to the spleen.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Prolapse of the Anus</strong></p>
<p>The lungs and the large intestine are interrelated. The anus is the entrance of the large intestine. When the lungs are excessively hot, they obstruct and block; when the lungs are weak and cold, the rectum may protrude. This condition can arise from prolonged dysentery, resulting in urgency and forceful straining of the anus, which may be exposed to external wind, or from heat-induced diarrhea, where the intestines become loose and uncontrollable. Alternatively, a constitution that is frail and weak can easily succumb to cold, leading to prolapse of the large intestine.</p>
<p>In children, diarrhea and dysentery are often caused by damp heat and wind-heat, which take advantage of a weakened spleen and stomach. Wind belongs to wood, and wood conquering suppresses earth, which governs the spleen and stomach—when they are weakened, they are easily subdued. Moreover, dampness tends to harm the spleen, and due to this weakness, it cannot discern the clear from the turbid. When food and water mix improperly, it results in profuse leakage; when this persists, the large intestine becomes weak.</p>
<p>The large intestine is associated with the hand yangming metal; however, if earth is weak, it cannot generate metal. Once the energy of metal becomes deficient, the pathways of transmission are also weakened and may be struck by cold wind, causing the anus to prolapse and fail to retract.</p>
<p>The treatment should aim to nourish the spleen and warm the stomach, allowing the metal to benefit from its mother and restore its energy. Formulas like Huo Xiang Tang, Yun Qi San, and Ping Wei San are advised. Subsequently, internal remedies to fortify the intestines can be given, such as Jian Pi Yin and Yang Zang Tang. Externally, methods like application of Fu Long Gan San and Bi Ma Gao at the rectal area can be used to uplift energy and encourage retraction; if retraction is achieved, wash off the remaining substances with water. Additionally, if there is pathogenic heat stagnating in the large intestine that has not been cleared, this condition may also arise.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>The anus is red and soft, the lung pulse is superficial and rapid, the fingerprints on the right hand are purple, the body is slightly warm, and there is occasional restlessness. First, administer the Clear Lung Drink for relief; then use Peppermint Powder and Panlong Powder for treatment, also taking Wanan Drink intermittently. </p>
<p>Chao states: When there is excess heat, constipation occurs; when there is deficiency cold, the anus may prolapse. This often results from vomiting and diarrhea leading to a deficiency in spleen Qi, which fails to nourish the lungs, causing the Qi of the large intestine to weaken and descend. Use the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction or the Four Gentlemen Decoction as a primary treatment. If there is prolapse that is bright red or causes pain, it indicates blood deficiency with heat; use Baizhong Yiqi Decoction supplemented with Siwu Decoction and Peony Root. If there is slight redness or pain, it indicates Qi deficiency with heat; supplement with the Four Gentlemen Decoction and Peony Root. Generally, if the hands and feet are warm, it relates to gastric heat; if they are cold, it relates to gastric cold.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The Tang family&#39;s method for treating rectal prolapse involves using scallion soup for steaming and washing to soften the condition, gently encouraging it back. This occurs following severe diarrhea; therefore, one may also take medicines for diarrhea, and then use sophora flowers and other herbs. Additionally, there is a method involving a decoction of sumac, combined with alumen for steaming and contraction. Another approach is to finely grind true cattail pollen, mix it with pig liver, apply it to the anus, and insert it. The &quot;Complete Infants’ Prescription&quot; suggests using the &quot;Thin Intestine Powder.&quot; For those who also experience hemorrhoids with swelling and pain, a mixture of yellow lead and talc can be used, adjusted with well water for application, which will reduce the condition; also, using half a qian of white lead powder and half a character of brain powder mixed with good wine applied to the swollen area works well. Huanglian Jiedu Decoction can also be taken, and using a bitter kyanite decoction for washing is effective. There are also applications using myrobalan, white alum, and ground brain powder, followed by washing with substances like schizopepan and saposhnikovia. Using the root of raw trichosanthes is also beneficial.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Children&#39;s Health: Eight Types of Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Children have weak and tender vital energy and blood, with soft internal organs. When exposed to wind and cold or consuming food that is too hot or too cold, they can be harmed by external pathogens, leading to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. This results in the stagnation of food and fluid, forming toxins and obstructions. It may manifest as an inability to absorb food or as a mixture of pus and blood, transforming into dysentery. There are eight types of dysentery:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Watery Dysentery</strong>: Characterized by thin, watery stools that do not coalesce, the passage of which is frequent and urgent, indicating unprocessed food.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cold Dysentery</strong>: Identified by the passage of pure white pus.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Hot Dysentery</strong>: Marked by the passage of pure red blood.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stagnant Dysentery</strong>: Involves stools that contain a mixture of pus and blood.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Accumulation Dysentery</strong>: Results from an accumulation injury, which may improve temporarily but can recur.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Consumption Dysentery</strong>: Occurs when consumption is present, leading to dysentery.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gu Dysentery</strong>: Resembles the effects of poison, resulting in purple or black blood, or resembling red bean juice or chicken and duck liver.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rest Inflicted Dysentery</strong>: Characterized by dark blood mixed with white substances, resembling fat from the intestines or the appearance of rotten fish intestines. This indicates ulceration of the intestines and stomach, and the patient should refrain from excessive concern, hence the name.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also referred to as &quot;rest inflicted&quot; because the affliction may lead to death without any respite. If dysentery patients cannot ingest gruel or medicine, it signals a condition nearing death.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Recipe for Da Huang Decoction</strong></p>
<p>This formula treats children who suffer from acute cold, digestive troubles due to food and water; if the milk is cold causing discomfort and not digesting; or if there is vomiting with distress due to cold stagnation, whether red or white, it is effective. If previously taken purgative formulas have led to an empty, cold stomach, resulting in watery stools, dry heaving, sunken eyes, and persistent distress unsuitable for further purging, one may use Da Huang. If nursing mothers have not cleared their water qi before feeding the child, and the child develops diarrhea, simply use Da Huang. For children with diarrhea who require assistance, use Da Huang; for those who do not need it and should be treated gently, it should be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Da Huang (six parts)  </li>

This is caused by the exterior cold injuring the Yang energy, allowing the heat to enter the stomach. Taking this remedy is beneficial. If one mistakenly uses purgative drugs or warm spleen decoctions, it will exacerbate the heat. If purgatives are used, it may lead to frequent diarrhea with red stools resembling rotten meat, or it may not heal even if purged; in that case, stronger heat-clearing drugs should be used. If the diarrhea does not stop and heat becomes more intense, taking this remedy will have immediate effects. If it is a warm disease with severe heat that encounters sudden cold, causing heat to enter the abdomen and resulting in bloody stools like fish brain, this remedy is effective. </p>

<p>The &quot;Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety&quot; states: A child from an official&#39;s family suffered from dysentery. He was taken by carriage from Yantou to Zhuge Temple and died upon entering. A person said: When ill, one should not be transported by carriage or on horseback. The illness was already severe, and moving him in a vehicle caused further disturbance, which is fatal.</p>
<p>The &quot;Pediatrics&quot; by the Wan family states: A five-year-old child had dysentery. The physician treated him with medicine, but the dysentery worsened, causing the energy in his spleen and stomach to sink. I used a formula of ginseng, poria, and white atracylodes to adjust his condition, and after ten days, the dysentery ceased. I took my leave. Some skeptics said to the father: &quot;No accumulation leads to dysentery. For children from wealthy families, it&#39;s mostly due to meat accumulation. I have found ferula (asafetida) effective for treating dysentery.” The father, confused, listened to them and made pills of ferula the size of small beans, giving his son three of them, after which the child fell into a deep sleep. When I arrived and was informed he had taken the ferula pills, I was shocked and said: &quot;While ferula may dispel meat accumulation, it greatly harms vital energy. Your son’s spleen and stomach are already weak; how can he take it?&quot; The father replied: &quot;He is at peace and sleeps heavily; he has not awakened.&quot; I suggested to the wet nurse to call him, and as he opened his eyes, his breath had already ceased.</p>
<p>A young child had dysentery with red and white discharge, feeling urgency and heaviness afterward, experiencing abdominal pain at times. He was treated with Huanglian pills and recovered. Later, he had food injuries, causing a recurrence of dysentery, with a desire to vomit and a poor appetite. I prescribed a modified Wuwei Yigong powder, adding three parts of wood fragrant, two parts of Huanglian, and one part of Wuzhuyu, and after several doses, he recovered.</p>
<p>A small child suffered from dysentery, presenting with dry mouth and fever. I administered Baizhu powder and allowed him to drink freely, while at times using Baizhu powder to facilitate taking Xianglian pills, and he became stable.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>A young child had a long-lasting case of diarrhea, experiencing urgency and heaviness in the lower abdomen, wanting to relieve themselves but unable to, with cold hands and feet. This was due to a deficiency of stomach energy and cold sinking down. The prescription used was a modified Baizhong Yiqi Decoction with the addition of Mu Xiang and Bu Guo Zhi, and an increased amount of Sheng Ma and Chai Hu, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child suffered from prolonged diarrhea, thirst, and fever. They drank soup, and a formula based on Baizhu San was used, combined with two taels of Ren Shen and one tael of Huang Lian, fried and made into pills. Taking several pills over time led to recovery.</p>
<p>A child experienced diarrhea without breastfeeding, took a purging remedy, which then turned into diarrhea with abdominal pain and heaviness afterward. The remaining treatment involved sending Xiang Lian Wan with Baizhong Yiqi Decoction and using Xiang Sha to assist the stomach with Liujunzi Decoction until recovery.</p>
<p>A child injured from milk and food frequently vomited. Various digestive aids were used, but the diarrhea did not stop. Initially, Liujunzi and Mu Xiang led to gradual improvement, followed by the use of Qiwwei Baizhu San, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child who injured their digestion from milk and food suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and turning to dysentery, accompanied by abdominal pain and heaviness. They initially took Xiang Lian Wan and recovered. If they consumed too much milk and food leading to abdominal pain, they first used Baohe Wan to stop the pain, then took five flavors Yigong San with added Mu Xiang in two doses, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A child with diarrhea experienced abdominal pain and coldness, with scanty urination. They were treated with five flavors Yigong San plus Rou Dou Kou, leading to immediate recovery. If vomiting and sour regurgitation occurred, using Ba Dou led to five bouts of diarrhea, decreasing appetite and experiencing cold hands and feet. The remaining treatment involved five flavors Yigong San combined with Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang, with little food intake; after doubling the dosage of Gan Jiang and taking four more doses, their hands and feet became warm, and the diarrhea also healed.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>A child developed diarrhea, resulting in abdominal distension, vomiting, loose stools, and difficulty urinating, with little response to various medicines. I first administered a modified Wuwei Yigong San with added Muxiang and Rouguo, leading to slight improvement in urination and defecation; after several doses, symptoms mildly improved. I then used the Bawei Wan to nourish the fire at the life gate, gradually reducing abdominal distension. The Jinkui Jiadianshen Wan was then given, and symptoms quickly subsided; I also used the Sijunzi and herbs like Shengma and Chaihu for overall stability.</p>
<p>For another child suffering from diarrhea, persistent coughing and wheezing indicated a deficiency of lung qi. I used a modified Liujunzi San to powder with Muxiang, administering a small amount mixed with ginseng, aged rice, and ginger soup, followed by sleep and minimal food intake. After two doses, coughing and wheezing significantly improved, so I switched to Sijunzi Tang, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A different child post-diarrhea exhibited fever and irritability, treated effectively with Sijunzi Tang, Danggui, Shengma, and Chaihu, leading to immediate relief; I then used Buzhong Yiqi Tang for their recovery. Due to subsequent food injury causing diarrhea and recurring symptoms, including acid regurgitation, I initially employed Yigong San with added Wuzhuyu and Muxiang in powdered form. After two doses, the acid reflux ceased, and then I removed Wuzhuyu and Muxiang for resolution.</p>
<p>Another child post-diarrhea exhibited irritability, thirst, flushed face, and a weak pulse suggestive of blood deficiency. I first prescribed Danggui Buxue Tang, followed by a modified Wuwei Yigong San with Shengma and Danggui for stabilization. In cases of ongoing food injury causing diarrhea and persistent irritability, the primary treatment continued with Yigong San, complemented by Bazhen Tang for stability.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Hejian&#39;s Six Writings (By Liu Wanshu)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Children suffering from spleen dysfunction and dysentery have significant heat. Sudden shock can cause dysentery with a greenish color, indicating heat as a proving factor. What about yellow dysentery? It arises when fire is excessive, causing water to decline and spleen function to be strong, leading to yellow dysentery. If the dysentery is red, it signifies deep heart fire, indicating severe heat; if the dysentery is black, it results from extreme heat where it combines with water&#39;s transformative effects, causing a black color.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>For children suffering from prolonged diarrhea, particularly around eight or nine months, it is often due to deep autumn-related cold dysentery, characterized by greenish-white diarrhea and occasional painful cramps. If there are unresolved milk phlegm issues, you may use Yin Pi Wan (Spleen Nourishing Pills) the size of a millet grain, taking 20 to 30 pills each time, washed down with rice drink, administered three times a day for recovery. Additionally, Yiyuang (a medicinal herb) can also be used.</p>

<h4>Dysentery</h4>
<p>Dysentery, regardless of being red or white, is associated with damp-heat. Some may mistakenly perceive the white type as cold; this is incorrect. It can also occur due to food accumulation. Treatment involves both strengthening and purging therapies. In cases of dysentery, whether red or white, both dampness and heat are usually present. However, hot conditions feature abdominal pain, while damp conditions do not cause pain. </p>
<p>For red dysentery, damp-heat injures the blood aspect, coming from the small intestine. The treatment method is to use Si Wu Decoction with the addition of Huang Lian (Coptis), Huang Qin (Scutellaria), and Huang Bai (Phellodendron). For white dysentery, damp-heat injures the qi aspect, coming from the large intestine. The treatment method is to use Si Jun Zi Decoction with the addition of Huang Lian and Cang Zhu (Atractylodes). </p>
<p>For cases of mixed red and white dysentery, both blood and qi have been injured, requiring Ba Zhen Decoction with the addition of Huang Lian, Huang Qin, Huang Bai, Huashi (Talc), and Cang Zhu for treatment. </p>
<p>In these three cases, if the symptoms are severe, add Bing Lang (Areca) and Zhi Ke (Bitter Orange). </p>
<p>For treating dysentery, regardless of color, during the initial phase, if there is urgency followed by heaviness, and abdominal distention with pain, first use San Huang Wan to purge; if severe, use Cheng Qi Decoction, followed by Xiang Lian Wan to supplement.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>For chronic red and white dysentery, when the person is weak and has not previously taken laxatives, if one administers laxatives, the person will feel empty and weak, which is detrimental. If laxatives are not given, the accumulation will not dissipate and recovery will be difficult. One should use Baohuan pills repeatedly for several doses, gauging treatment by the alleviation of abdominal pain; afterwards, use Xianglian pills for adjustment.</p>
<p>In treating dysentery, one must never recklessly use poisonous drugs like ba dou or qian niu; instead, the use of Sanhuang pills is advised.</p>
<p>For dysentery accompanied by fresh blood, the treatment is to use Qingxue pills and take a decoction of plantain herb and roasted old rice, which is remarkably effective.</p>
<p>For white saliva in dysentery that does not stop for a long time, use Guichang pills and take them with a controlled amount of brewed old rice, which is notably effective.</p>
<p>For red and white dysentery that persists for a long time, use Ergeng pills and take them with brewed old rice for immediate effect.</p>
<p>For pure red dysentery in summer, roast Yiyuan powder with talcum powder and add red yeast to make pills, taking them with brewed old rice.</p>
<p>In cases of red and white dysentery with rectal prolapse, this indicates downward energy, so one should lift and support it using Hezhong pills followed by Shengma decoction.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ancestral tradition treats dysentery. Without distinguishing between red and white, one first administers detoxifying pills, then uses Xianglian pills to adjust the condition. </p>
<p>Dysentery was formerly known as &quot;stagnation and diarrhea,&quot; caused by accumulated food and damp heat. Symptoms include bowel sounds and pain, making it hard to find comfort, with urgency and a feeling of heaviness inside without a clear side. Red indicates excessive heat in the small intestine, while white signifies the evil invading the large intestine. Inept physicians mistakenly treat white as cold, using pungent and hot herbs chaotically.</p>
<p>Initially, there are no two methods for treating dysentery, as the secret of Hejian is passed down. The techniques of regulating qi and harmonizing blood should be prioritized, with a focus on obtaining the root without deviation. Once qi is activated, the feeling of heaviness will cease, and the movement of blood must calm the dysentery. Avoid spicy and sweet flavors when treating cold and damp conditions, not fearing the passage of years or days.</p>
<p>Generally, one should first administer purgatives such as Huanglian, Zhikua, and Binglang. Big Yellow should be steamed with alcohol, with Licorice and Mangxiao used nearby. If red and white dysentery persists for a long time, and the patient is weak and restless, Baohuo pills are the immortal remedy, requiring careful recognition of the illness.</p>
<p>After the evacuation, pain and urgency should be alleviated, followed by a careful analysis of red and white symptoms. For red dysentery, do not exceed the use of the red formula; for white dysentery, it is safe and reliable for the intestines. If red and white symptoms coexist without improvement, Xianglian pills are highly effective. Renowned physicians spread their names across the four seas, achieving prominence atop a brocade crown.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If encountering a seasonal dysentery, there is no difference in opening the door. Headaches, body heat, and slow sighing are to be feared in times of epidemics. First, use ginseng to dispel toxins, then apply purging methods. However, one must observe the pulse and adjust accordingly, distinguishing weakness from strength before stopping.</p>
<p>If dysentery persists without cessation, the qi stagnates and the intestines become slippery. Urgently administer good medicine to reinforce and stabilize.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>In spring and autumn months, children are exposed to cold in the morning and evening. The cold air affects their limbs, and if heat cannot be released, it leads to strong heat. If cold air enters the stomach, it causes diarrhea, which may be red or white, appearing several times. Children may have abdominal distension and severe pain from the strong heat, with vigorous and rapid pulses. For those with heat, it is advisable to administer a regulating decoction; when the heat in the stools subsides, the diarrhea will also resolve. However, those with strong heat who do not vomit or have diarrhea should also take it. </p>
<p>Additionally, in the summer months and early autumn, if exposed to sudden cold amidst intense heat, the body cannot disperse it, leading to internal turmoil. If it manifests externally, it results in malaria; if internally, it leads to diarrhea. When both conditions arise, malaria and diarrhea occur simultaneously, caused by disharmony in the protective and nutritive Qi, and weakness in the intestines and stomach, permitting cold and hot air to invade. This can also be due to dietary harm from unregulated cold and heat, where combined cold yields white, and combined heat yields red stools. If cold and heat attack together, pus and blood will be mixed; it can also be caused by accumulated heat resulting in red diarrhea, and accumulated cold resulting in white diarrhea, resulting in confusion between red and white and the accumulation of both cold and heat.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach qi, and they cannot digest food, then waste does not gather; or in spring, if released from discomfort, if harmed by cold winds, the intestines and stomach may weaken, and suddenly be afflicted by wind and cold, resulting in frequent diarrhea. The classics say: &quot;If harmed by wind in spring, summer will certainly have diarrhea.&quot; For this, a formula regulating the middle can be used, removing rhubarb and adding bitter orange. If diarrhea does not stop, add yellow bitter to treat it. For sudden diarrhea, use powdered plantago seed, mixed with rice drink, which is also effective. In hot months, use Wuling powder or plantago seed powder, mixed with light heart soup; also use a modified version of the Fire-Purging powder. If there are joint diseases of Taiyang and Yangming, there will definitely be diarrhea, for which Gegen decoction is the main treatment. If accompanied by vomiting, add pinellia. Sijunzi decoction is also applicable.</p>
<p>Concerning Various Types of Diarrhea</p>
<p>Diarrhea in children often arises from excessive eating habits, or from eating fruits and meats without knowing when to stop. Thus, the spleen and stomach, still weak, cannot handle it, leading to accumulation in the organs, which causes diarrhea. If heat strikes, it will be red. If wind and cold enter the intestines and stomach, causing the current fluids to stagnate, it will result in white diarrhea. If it is accompanied by greenish discharge, it may be due to fright accumulation; or if it feels very painful in the stomach like brain of fish. Generally, the eight types of diarrhea are only distinguished by heat and cold, red and white. Even though the properties of the medicines may differ, the treatment methods are not far apart. If there is a mix of red and white, first eliminate the heat accumulation by using medicines like rhubarb, bitter orange, and sodium sulfate to remove heat and toxins; then employ yellow bitter, bitter chrysanthemum, and berberine to resolve the heat, thus stopping the diarrhea and alleviating the pain—this is a wonderful method. If the diarrhea does not stop, use prepared ephedra and other medicines for regulation, and it will naturally return to normal.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

To relieve intestinal pain and loosen the bowels, one should first use water-soaked Dan, Baidu San, Diyu Drink, and a laxative mixture with Zhiqiao.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Overview by Lou Ying</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Pediatric dysentery in children is generally caused by disharmony between the spleen and stomach, overindulgence in inappropriate foods, leading to stagnation that cannot be transformed. Additionally, it can be caused by a wet heat pathogen or by the nursing mother consuming excessive raw or overly rich foods and transmitting these effects. Symptoms arise also from the invasion of pathogenic factors like wind, warmth, and dampness. In cases where there is urgent abdominal pain, the nature of fire is rapid, which can dry out materials. Sometimes, at the end of summer or beginning of autumn, a sudden chill may invade internally without any means of dispersal, leading to conditions like malaria; if both internal and external symptoms manifest, it can result in dysentery-malaria.</p>
<p>If dysentery persists for a long time, it can cause swelling and fullness, with the lower body being colder and the upper body having heat accumulation, resulting in a condition of excess above and deficiency below. In cases where there is damp heat toxicity affecting the spleen, it can lead to a blockage in the stomach, resulting in symptoms like locked jaw. There is also a possibility of family transmission, where the young and old show similar symptoms, indicating an epidemic dysentery. Treatment should first consider the seasonal changes to balance external factors, examine stagnation to regulate internal conditions, carefully assess the nature of injuries, and distinguish between excess and deficiency, as well as hot and cold conditions, to provide effective treatment without arbitrary interventions.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Red and White Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Regarding red and white dysentery, people generally say that red represents Yang and heat, while white represents Yin and cold; some even assert that without accumulation, dysentery cannot occur. However, when it comes to treatment, if one were to alternate between hot and cold medicines or use laxatives to remove accumulation, it would be difficult to achieve effective results. Without understanding the underlying causes, how can one expect to treat it? Moreover, during the changing of the seasons and among various winds, the interplay of the five movements and six atmospheres leads people to suffer from dysentery, particularly in summer and autumn. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: &quot;In spring, one is harmed by wind; in summer, one suffers from diarrhea.&quot; The &quot;Treatise on True Principles&quot; says: &quot;Lesser Yang is in the springs, defeated by excessive fire, causing the populace to suffer from red and white dysentery.&quot; Can one strictly adhere to the idea that without accumulation, dysentery cannot occur? If one only considers accumulation, then is it not the case that during summer and autumn, many suffer from it, while in spring and winter, this is not the same? It is indeed the case that pathogenic wind enters the stomach, where wood can overcome earth. If it does not lead to violent diarrhea, it results in dysentery, characterized by a mixture of red and white, indicating a lack of distinction between Yin and Yang. </p>
<p>The proper method should clarify the distinction between Yin and Yang, using Wuling San to guide the counterflow, and Lirong Tang to warm the stomach, allowing the colors to harmonize before applying treatment. If after this differentiation, red and white continue to descend together, then one must investigate the root cause of the ailment. If white appears first, followed by red, it indicates internal injury from cold, resulting from failing to keep covered, with the primal energy affected by summer heat. The treatment should first save the interior, followed by dispelling the heat toxin. If red appears first and is then followed by white, it indicates that heat has harmed first, followed by loss of coverage leading to cold. The priority should be to relieve the heat, then treat the dysentery.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

All these are signs of a yin condition, as cold can obstruct the blood. First, use Wuling San combined with Shouzhong Decoction and decoct it, then follow with Fuzi Lizhong Decoction and take it warm, or use Guzhen Decoction. If one cannot distinguish the deficiencies of yin and yang or the hot and cold conditions and mistakenly administer treatment, it will result in further weakening of the spleen and stomach, leading to an inability to digest food, or may even cause lockjaw dysentery, which is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Additionally, if there is urgency in the abdomen followed by heaviness at the back, it indicates urgency in the yang and heaviness in the yin. Abdominal pain before defecation indicates urgency, while pain after defecation indicates heaviness. Therefore, in cases of urgency, it is due to diarrhea in the large intestine. First, take Daxun Drink combined with Kuangqi Drink for resolution, along with Qianghuo San, prepared with ginger and millet water; then use Kuan Chang Wan. For heaviness, which indicates qi deficiency, combine Wuling San with ginseng and ginger and take as a decoction, and also administer Xianglian Wan. Ifboth conditions occur together, the first two pills can be administered together, or Baijin Drink or Jinsu Wan are also good options. However, diarrhea and dysentery are two distinct conditions: when watery stools mixed with feces are abundant and come easily, it is called diarrhea; when blood-stained white mucus comes in small amounts and is painful, it is called dysentery.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

When there is a mixture of pus and blood that does not stop for a long time, varying between light during the day and heavy at night, or frequent during both day and night, with reduced appetite and increased pain, one should use Wanjin powder or Shenyxiao powder to address it. </p>
<p>If there is a five-colored diarrhea, it is due to accumulated heat in the five internal organs, persisting for a long time, resulting in this condition. When the five organs receive heat, the nutritive and defensive qi become unbalanced, leading to improper digestion of grains, which corrupts the internal organs, causing the spirit to feel dull. At this point, it is quite dangerous, especially with sharp abdominal pain, and those who are small children have no treatment method. The five colors signify that the colors of the five organs are all visible on the surface. For older children, one may use the standard formula San Shen Wan or Xiao Lai Fu Dan, combined with Wuling powder for administration. If the medicines continue to be ineffective, one should not administer them further.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a wind diarrhea, mostly yellow-brown in color, which closely resembles malnutrition diarrhea but can be distinguished by the lack of foul smell. This wind poison stagnates in the spleen, requiring the removal of wind toxin from the spleen channel, with Xie Huang powder as the main treatment. If one observes both red and white substances being expelled together, and this continues without cessation, along with scant urine, simultaneous pain and heat symptoms, cracked lips and red eyes, shortness of breath with agitation, restlessness in sitting or lying down, extreme thirst for water, and food sinking within the body, combined with periodic facial appearances as if painted, along with lack of appetite, it is difficult to treat.</p>

Haizang employs the Four Gentlemen Decoction, along with Chuanxiong and Angelica to treat weakness-related dysentery, and the Four Gentlemen Decoction with dry ginger for cold-related dysentery. I often treat cases where the hands and feet are hot and the patient drinks cold as real heat, using the Xianglian Pill; for cases where the hands and feet are cold and the patient drinks hot, I consider it virtual cold, employing the Yigong Powder with Xianglian Pill. If there are also symptoms of body heaviness and limb pain, it indicates damp heat injuring the spleen, for which I use the Shengyang Yige Decoction. If urination is not smooth, indicating a lack of distinction between yin and yang, I use the Wuling Powder. If damp heat has subsided but the dysentery persists, it indicates sinking of spleen qi, and I use the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, adding increased doses of Cimicifuga and Bupleurum. For dysentery accompanied by vomiting, or abdominal pain, it indicates spleen and stomach deficiency and cold, so I use the Yigong Powder with prepared ginger and costus. If it transforms into intermittent fever, it indicates liver defeating the spleen, for which I use the Liu Junzi Decoction with Bupleurum and Eclipta. If accumulation and stagnation has been resolved but dysentery continues, it indicates deficiency of spleen qi, and I use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with Xianglian Pill. If the condition is caused by a nursing mother consuming rich and heavy foods, leading the child to illness, one should identify the cause, treat the mother accordingly, and also consider symptoms of heat and cold dysentery, constipation, and abdominal pain. If there are accompanying exterior symptoms, it is necessary to release the exterior. </p>
<p>For the treatment of dysentery, if one wishes to address accumulation, simply use official methods to consume robust pills which can treat accumulation while also alleviating dysentery, ensuring efficacy. Once accumulation has cleared, promptly use the Four Gentlemen Decoction with cardamom and Chebula to replenish, followed by taking thick intestine Xianglian Pills for effectiveness.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>White Pus Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ying Tong Bao Jian&quot; discusses children&#39;s intestinal cold, which leads to white pus and abdominal pain.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed Pus and Blood Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Sheng Hui&quot; states: for children with pus and blood dysentery, it arises from toxic qi within the organs. When the blood heats up, it overflows and permeates into the large intestine, clashing with the fluids in the intestines, accumulating heat and becoming congealed. The blood transforms into pus; hence, if the abdomen is weak, diarrhea results, leading to pus and blood dysentery. The &quot;Ge Shi Zhu Hou&quot; states: children’s internal toxins stagnate like fish brains.</p>
<p><strong>Five-Color Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Xing Zheng Lun&quot; sings: Five-color dysentery has many manifestations; knowing this, one understands the five types. The blue color signifies shock and accumulation; yellow indicates excess food accumulation in the spleen. White signifies cold weakness in the intestines and stomach; red indicates intense accumulated heat that is difficult to pacify. Chicken liver hidden accumulation forms patches; with mixed black blood, it is hard to stabilize. Lips chapped, chest elevated, exposing teeth; the face red with veins protruding always in front. Urgently pacify the organs with herbal decoctions; physicians must pay attention as the ancient sages taught. </p>
<p>Another song states: Do not regard five-color dysentery as strange; it appears in children under four years old. Blue arises from shock accumulation; yellow from food toxicity in the spleen. Red and black indicate heart and kidney issues; white indicates harm mainly to the spleen. Before the age of three, there is no fluctuation; do not allow excessive sleeping or late meals. </p>
<p>This illness requires harmonizing the five organs and nourishing the defensive and nutritive qi for gradual recovery. If the eyes are swollen and the diet is not improved, only use Ping Wei San for supplementation.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Gū Lì (Dysentery)</h3>
<p>The &quot;Cháo Shì Bìng Yuán&quot; states: In children, gū poison dysentery occurs when seasonal changes in cold and heat are unregulated, leading to toxic and harmful qi. Children are weakened and hurt by it, with evils clashing against blood and qi, entering the intestines and stomach. Toxic qi accumulates; if the large intestine is vacuous, it transforms into dysentery with blood. The color of the dysentery resembles coagulated blood like pieces of chicken or duck liver, which accompanies the dysentery. This is due to the excess of toxic heat, affecting the internal organs, resembling gū poisoning; hence it is called gū toxin dysentery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Shí Bì Jīng&quot; states that the song of the spleen toxin dysentery goes: &quot;Within the spleen, there is a toxin called pure yang. This is caused by the excessive heat from medicinal herbs hurting the body. It leads to many blockages in the large intestine and to abundant desiccated blood in the shriveled intestines. If the abdomen is windy and closed, it is hard to open one&#39;s eyes. The body heats up, the head feels warm, and the feet turn cold. The tongue is red and the chest is elevated—these are the signs to follow. There is much weeping and shortness of breath, resembling madness. First, one must resolve the heat and open the appetite. This is when good physicians apply their remedies.&quot;</p>
<p>When the spleen suffers from heat accumulation and becomes toxic, the treatment should cool the spleen and then eliminate the accumulation. If the bones in the chest suddenly rise, leading to increased dyspnea, it is not treatable.</p>
<p>The &quot;Fèng Suǐ Jīng&quot; annotation states: It is advisable to take Jīn Huá Sǎn and Xiāng Lián Wán.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xíng Zhèng Lùn&quot; states that the wind toxin dysentery song highlights: &quot;Among the eight types of dysentery, the wind transforms with difficulty, appearing like the thick juice of green grass. The toxic wind mixes with bean juice, adding excessive heat. The stomach is ruined, resembling pieces of chicken liver. There is no need to first purgative the accumulation; closing the eyelids and completely avoiding food is unbearable to see. If it returns to white dysentery, it must be purged. The viscera and bowels should frequently be warmed to restore their original state.&quot;<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Dysentery with Accompanying Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Chao&#39;s Disease Sources&quot; states: In children, dysentery accompanied by thirst indicates a watery dysentery. When fluids are depleted and the organs are weak and dry, it leads to increased thirst. If urination is frequent, dysentery ceases when thirst is relieved; if urination is scant, and fluids don’t move into the small intestine, but instead seep into the intestines and stomach, thirst persists and dysentery continues. In such cases, the body will appear swollen, as the spleen qi is too weak to manage fluids, leading to eye pain as well. Children generally have heat in the upper burner; now, with dysentery, the lower burner is weak and the upper burner is hot, resulting in excessive qi and heat affecting the liver. Mr. Mao believes food injury to the spleen and stomach is the cause, and suggests starting with &quot;Awakening the Spleen Powder&quot; and &quot;Harmony Qi Powder&quot; for adjustment. After a day, use &quot;Middle-Adjustment Drink&quot; with &quot;Milk Aroma Powder&quot; and &quot;Dragon Spit Paste&quot; to restore health. Alternatively, simply making a juice from winter melon may also help.</p>
<p><strong>Emaciation</strong></p>
<p>Chao states: In children, when the intestines and stomach are weak and affected by wind and cold, it leads to dysentery. After the dysentery resolves, the spleen and stomach remain weak, and qi from grains is still low, resulting in emaciation.</p>
<p><strong>Swelling</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Huiji&quot; discusses the case of children experiencing swelling all over after dysentery. The verse states: &quot;If cold dysentery is untreated for long, widespread swelling occurs as if blown up. A strong pulse indicates qi has turned to water, and firmness arises from accumulations.&quot; The best method is to smooth the qi to reduce swelling; after balancing qi for two days, frequent urination will establish. Avoid overeating to prevent stagnation, as this condition fundamentally stems from the damage to the spleen.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Prolapse of the Anus</strong></p>
<p>The lungs and the large intestine are interrelated. The anus is the entrance of the large intestine. When the lungs are excessively hot, they obstruct and block; when the lungs are weak and cold, the rectum may protrude. This condition can arise from prolonged dysentery, resulting in urgency and forceful straining of the anus, which may be exposed to external wind, or from heat-induced diarrhea, where the intestines become loose and uncontrollable. Alternatively, a constitution that is frail and weak can easily succumb to cold, leading to prolapse of the large intestine.</p>
<p>In children, diarrhea and dysentery are often caused by damp heat and wind-heat, which take advantage of a weakened spleen and stomach. Wind belongs to wood, and wood conquering suppresses earth, which governs the spleen and stomach—when they are weakened, they are easily subdued. Moreover, dampness tends to harm the spleen, and due to this weakness, it cannot discern the clear from the turbid. When food and water mix improperly, it results in profuse leakage; when this persists, the large intestine becomes weak.</p>
<p>The large intestine is associated with the hand yangming metal; however, if earth is weak, it cannot generate metal. Once the energy of metal becomes deficient, the pathways of transmission are also weakened and may be struck by cold wind, causing the anus to prolapse and fail to retract.</p>
<p>The treatment should aim to nourish the spleen and warm the stomach, allowing the metal to benefit from its mother and restore its energy. Formulas like Huo Xiang Tang, Yun Qi San, and Ping Wei San are advised. Subsequently, internal remedies to fortify the intestines can be given, such as Jian Pi Yin and Yang Zang Tang. Externally, methods like application of Fu Long Gan San and Bi Ma Gao at the rectal area can be used to uplift energy and encourage retraction; if retraction is achieved, wash off the remaining substances with water. Additionally, if there is pathogenic heat stagnating in the large intestine that has not been cleared, this condition may also arise.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

<p>Chao states: When there is excess heat, constipation occurs; when there is deficiency cold, the anus may prolapse. This often results from vomiting and diarrhea leading to a deficiency in spleen Qi, which fails to nourish the lungs, causing the Qi of the large intestine to weaken and descend. Use the Baizhong Yiqi Decoction or the Four Gentlemen Decoction as a primary treatment. If there is prolapse that is bright red or causes pain, it indicates blood deficiency with heat; use Baizhong Yiqi Decoction supplemented with Siwu Decoction and Peony Root.

Another approach is to finely grind true cattail pollen, mix it with pig liver, apply it to the anus, and insert it. The &quot;Complete Infants’ Prescription&quot; suggests using the &quot;Thin Intestine Powder.&quot; For those who also experience hemorrhoids with swelling and pain, a mixture of yellow lead and talc can be used, adjusted with well water for application, which will reduce the condition; also, using half a qian of white lead powder and half a character of brain powder mixed with good wine applied to the swollen area works well.

<p>　　小儿气血怯嫩，脏腑软弱，因触冒风寒，饮食冷热，以邪干正，致脾胃不和，凝滞停积，蕴毒结作，或水谷不聚，或脓血纯杂，变而为痢。其候有八：一曰水谷痢，谓便下粪稀薄而不聚，快利出易，水谷不化也。然虽是泻，便时亦觉里急后重，故为痢也。二曰冷痢，谓便下纯白脓也。三曰热痢，谓便下纯赤血也。四曰滞痢，谓便下脓血相杂也。五曰积痢，谓有积伤为痢，浸久或差而复发也。六曰疳痢，谓患疳积而下痢也。七曰蛊痢，谓如蛊毒下紫黑血，或如赤豆汁，或如鸡鸭肝片也。八曰休惜痢，谓下血黑黯中有白物，如肠中之脂或如烂鱼肠之状。此肠胃溃伤，患者更休爱惜，故以名之。亦名休息者，谓患即无休息而至死也。凡痢若粥药不能进者，此便为死候也。<a id="orig-22p" href="#trans-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Children&#39;s Health: Eight Types of Dysentery</strong></p>
<p>Children have weak and tender vital energy and blood, with soft internal organs. When exposed to wind and cold or consuming food that is too hot or too cold, they can be harmed by external pathogens, leading to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. This results in the stagnation of food and fluid, forming toxins and obstructions. It may manifest as an inability to absorb food or as a mixture of pus and blood, transforming into dysentery. There are eight types of dysentery:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Watery Dysentery</strong>: Characterized by thin, watery stools that do not coalesce, the passage of which is frequent and urgent, indicating unprocessed food.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cold Dysentery</strong>: Identified by the passage of pure white pus.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Hot Dysentery</strong>: Marked by the passage of pure red blood.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stagnant Dysentery</strong>: Involves stools that contain a mixture of pus and blood.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Accumulation Dysentery</strong>: Results from an accumulation injury, which may improve temporarily but can recur.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Consumption Dysentery</strong>: Occurs when consumption is present, leading to dysentery.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Gu Dysentery</strong>: Resembles the effects of poison, resulting in purple or black blood, or resembling red bean juice or chicken and duck liver.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rest Inflicted Dysentery</strong>: Characterized by dark blood mixed with white substances, resembling fat from the intestines or the appearance of rotten fish intestines. This indicates ulceration of the intestines and stomach, and the patient should refrain from excessive concern, hence the name.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also referred to as &quot;rest inflicted&quot; because the affliction may lead to death without any respite. If dysentery patients cannot ingest gruel or medicine, it signals a condition nearing death.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Recipe for Da Huang Decoction</strong></p>
<p>This formula treats children who suffer from acute cold, digestive troubles due to food and water; if the milk is cold causing discomfort and not digesting; or if there is vomiting with distress due to cold stagnation, whether red or white, it is effective. If previously taken purgative formulas have led to an empty, cold stomach, resulting in watery stools, dry heaving, sunken eyes, and persistent distress unsuitable for further purging, one may use Da Huang. If nursing mothers have not cleared their water qi before feeding the child, and the child develops diarrhea, simply use Da Huang. For children with diarrhea who require assistance, use Da Huang; for those who do not need it and should be treated gently, it should be avoided.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Huangbo Decoction is for treating children who suffer from sudden cold in the summer, where cold counteracts severe heat, causing heat to enter the stomach, leading to red and white stagnation like fish brain, with intense heat, headaches, body heat, and irritated hands and feet. This is caused by the exterior cold injuring the Yang energy, allowing the heat to enter the stomach. Taking this remedy is beneficial. If one mistakenly uses purgative drugs or warm spleen decoctions, it will exacerbate the heat. If purgatives are used, it may lead to frequent diarrhea with red stools resembling rotten meat, or it may not heal even if purged; in that case, stronger heat-clearing drugs should be used. If the diarrhea does not stop and heat becomes more intense, taking this remedy will have immediate effects. If it is a warm disease with severe heat that encounters sudden cold, causing heat to enter the abdomen and resulting in bloody stools like fish brain, this remedy is effective. </p>

If the prolapse has persisted and is accompanied by wind-cerebral issues, arching back, excessive crying, incoherent speech, and paroxysmal drooling, apply moxibustion at Bai Hui for six times. Moxibustion should penetrate five inches directly at the hairline and in the center of the top of the head, capable of holding moxa the size of a small wheat grain.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Confucian Teachings on Filial Piety&quot; states: A child from an official&#39;s family suffered from dysentery. He was taken by carriage from Yantou to Zhuge Temple and died upon entering. A person said: When ill, one should not be transported by carriage or on horseback. The illness was already severe, and moving him in a vehicle caused further disturbance, which is fatal.</p>
<p>The &quot;Pediatrics&quot; by the Wan family states: A five-year-old child had dysentery. The physician treated him with medicine, but the dysentery worsened, causing the energy in his spleen and stomach to sink. I used a formula of ginseng, poria, and white atracylodes to adjust his condition, and after ten days, the dysentery ceased. I took my leave. Some skeptics said to the father: &quot;No accumulation leads to dysentery. For children from wealthy families, it&#39;s mostly due to meat accumulation. I have found ferula (asafetida) effective for treating dysentery.” The father, confused, listened to them and made pills of ferula the size of small beans, giving his son three of them, after which the child fell into a deep sleep. When I arrived and was informed he had taken the ferula pills, I was shocked and said: &quot;While ferula may dispel meat accumulation, it greatly harms vital energy. Your son’s spleen and stomach are already weak; how can he take it?&quot; The father replied: &quot;He is at peace and sleeps heavily; he has not awakened.&quot; I suggested to the wet nurse to call him, and as he opened his eyes, his breath had already ceased.</p>
<p>A young child had dysentery with red and white discharge, feeling urgency and heaviness afterward, experiencing abdominal pain at times. He was treated with Huanglian pills and recovered. Later, he had food injuries, causing a recurrence of dysentery, with a desire to vomit and a poor appetite. I prescribed a modified Wuwei Yigong powder, adding three parts of wood fragrant, two parts of Huanglian, and one part of Wuzhuyu, and after several doses, he recovered.</p>
<p>A small child suffered from dysentery, presenting with dry mouth and fever. I administered Baizhu powder and allowed him to drink freely, while at times using Baizhu powder to facilitate taking Xianglian pills, and he became stable.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

<p>Another child suffered from prolonged diarrhea, thirst, and fever. They drank soup, and a formula based on Baizhu San was used, combined with two taels of Ren Shen and one tael of Huang Lian, fried and made into pills. Taking several pills over time led to recovery.</p>
<p>A child experienced diarrhea without breastfeeding, took a purging remedy, which then turned into diarrhea with abdominal pain and heaviness afterward. The remaining treatment involved sending Xiang Lian Wan with Baizhong Yiqi Decoction and using Xiang Sha to assist the stomach with Liujunzi Decoction until recovery.</p>
<p>A child injured from milk and food frequently vomited. Various digestive aids were used, but the diarrhea did not stop. Initially, Liujunzi and Mu Xiang led to gradual improvement, followed by the use of Qiwwei Baizhu San, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child who injured their digestion from milk and food suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and turning to dysentery, accompanied by abdominal pain and heaviness. They initially took Xiang Lian Wan and recovered. If they consumed too much milk and food leading to abdominal pain, they first used Baohe Wan to stop the pain, then took five flavors Yigong San with added Mu Xiang in two doses, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A child with diarrhea experienced abdominal pain and coldness, with scanty urination. They were treated with five flavors Yigong San plus Rou Dou Kou, leading to immediate recovery. If vomiting and sour regurgitation occurred, using Ba Dou led to five bouts of diarrhea, decreasing appetite and experiencing cold hands and feet. The remaining treatment involved five flavors Yigong San combined with Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang, with little food intake; after doubling the dosage of Gan Jiang and taking four more doses, their hands and feet became warm, and the diarrhea also healed.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a></p></div>

Some may mistakenly perceive the white type as cold; this is incorrect. It can also occur due to food accumulation. Treatment involves both strengthening and purging therapies. In cases of dysentery, whether red or white, both dampness and heat are usually present. However, hot conditions feature abdominal pain, while damp conditions do not cause pain. For red dysentery, damp-heat injures the blood aspect, coming from the small intestine. The treatment method is to use Si Wu Decoction with the addition of Huang Lian (Coptis), Huang Qin (Scutellaria), and Huang Bai (Phellodendron). For white dysentery, damp-heat injures the qi aspect, coming from the large intestine. The treatment method is to use Si Jun Zi Decoction with the addition of Huang Lian and Cang Zhu (Atractylodes). For cases of mixed red and white dysentery, both blood and qi have been injured, requiring Ba Zhen Decoction with the addition of Huang Lian, Huang Qin, Huang Bai, Huashi (Talc), and Cang Zhu for treatment. In these three cases, if the symptoms are severe, add Bing Lang (Areca) and Zhi Ke (Bitter Orange).

In treating dysentery, one must never recklessly use poisonous drugs like ba dou or qian niu; instead, the use of Sanhuang pills is advised. For dysentery accompanied by fresh blood, the treatment is to use Qingxue pills and take a decoction of plantain herb and roasted old rice, which is remarkably effective. For white saliva in dysentery that does not stop for a long time, use Guichang pills and take them with a controlled amount of brewed old rice, which is notably effective. For red and white dysentery that persists for a long time, use Ergeng pills and take them with brewed old rice for immediate effect. For pure red dysentery in summer, roast Yiyuan powder with talcum powder and add red yeast to make pills, taking them with brewed old rice.

For a child with silent mouth dysentery, applying this medicine into the eyes two or three times is remarkably effective. After dysentery has ceased, if there is still fever and weakness, one should use the Jisheng pill.

Without distinguishing between red and white, one first administers detoxifying pills, then uses Xianglian pills to adjust the condition. Dysentery was formerly known as \"stagnation and diarrhea,\" caused by accumulated food and damp heat. Symptoms include bowel sounds and pain, making it hard to find comfort, with urgency and a feeling of heaviness inside without a clear side. Red indicates excessive heat in the small intestine, while white signifies the evil invading the large intestine. Inept physicians mistakenly treat white as cold, using pungent and hot herbs chaotically. Initially, there are no two methods for treating dysentery, as the secret of Hejian is passed down. The techniques of regulating qi and harmonizing blood should be prioritized, with a focus on obtaining the root without deviation. Once qi is activated, the feeling of heaviness will cease, and the movement of blood must calm the dysentery. Avoid spicy and sweet flavors when treating cold and damp conditions, not fearing the passage of years or days. Generally, one should first administer purgatives such as Huanglian, Zhikua, and Binglang. Big Yellow should be steamed with alcohol, with Licorice and Mangxiao used nearby. If red and white dysentery persists for a long time, and the patient is weak and restless, Baohuo pills are the immortal remedy, requiring careful recognition of the illness. After the evacuation, pain and urgency should be alleviated, followed by a careful analysis of red and white symptoms. For red dysentery, do not exceed the use of the red formula; for white dysentery, it is safe and reliable for the intestines.

If dysentery persists without cessation, the qi stagnates and the intestines become slippery. Urgently administer good medicine to reinforce and stabilize. Ginseng, angelica, and asarum, with black plum, buckwheat husks, and scutellaria. Dried ginger, chebula, red poria, with japonica rice and dried tangerine peel as a guide. Remember the medicinal items for dysentery—detoxifying with gardenia and scutellaria. The two substances of natron and realgar can promote transformation, while woody and green peels relieve pain. Bitter orange and betel nut for heaviness, and asarum and bupleurum can uplift. Strengthen the intestines with buckwheat husks and chebula, and use alisma and polyporus for smoothness. If dysentery is untreated, the symptoms will be numerous, with a pulse like a roaring river that must be guarded against.

The cold air affects their limbs, and if heat cannot be released, it leads to strong heat. If cold air enters the stomach, it causes diarrhea, which may be red or white, appearing several times. Children may have abdominal distension and severe pain from the strong heat, with vigorous and rapid pulses. For those with heat, it is advisable to administer a regulating decoction; when the heat in the stools subsides, the diarrhea will also resolve. However, those with strong heat who do not vomit or have diarrhea should also take it. Additionally, in the summer months and early autumn, if exposed to sudden cold amidst intense heat, the body cannot disperse it, leading to internal turmoil. If it manifests externally, it results in malaria; if internally, it leads to diarrhea. When both conditions arise, malaria and diarrhea occur simultaneously, caused by disharmony in the protective and nutritive Qi, and weakness in the intestines and stomach, permitting cold and hot air to invade. This can also be due to dietary harm from unregulated cold and heat, where combined cold yields white, and combined heat yields red stools. If cold and heat attack together, pus and blood will be mixed; it can also be caused by accumulated heat resulting in red diarrhea, and accumulated cold resulting in white diarrhea, resulting in confusion between red and white and the accumulation of both cold and heat."},{"anchor":"trans-8p","marker":"8p","type":"translation","text":"If there is deficiency in the spleen and stomach qi, and they cannot digest food, then waste does not gather; or in spring, if released from discomfort, if harmed by cold winds, the intestines and stomach may weaken, and suddenly be afflicted by wind and cold, resulting in frequent diarrhea. The classics say: \"If harmed by wind in spring, summer will certainly have diarrhea.\" For this, a formula regulating the middle can be used, removing rhubarb and adding bitter orange. If diarrhea does not stop, add yellow bitter to treat it. For sudden diarrhea, use powdered plantago seed, mixed with rice drink, which is also effective. In hot months, use Wuling powder or plantago seed powder, mixed with light heart soup; also use a modified version of the Fire-Purging powder. If there are joint diseases of Taiyang and Yangming, there will definitely be diarrhea, for which Gegen decoction is the main treatment. If accompanied by vomiting, add pinellia. Sijunzi decoction is also applicable. Concerning Various Types of Diarrhea Diarrhea in children often arises from excessive eating habits, or from eating fruits and meats without knowing when to stop. Thus, the spleen and stomach, still weak, cannot handle it, leading to accumulation in the organs, which causes diarrhea. If heat strikes, it will be red. If wind and cold enter the intestines and stomach, causing the current fluids to stagnate, it will result in white diarrhea. If it is accompanied by greenish discharge, it may be due to fright accumulation; or if it feels very painful in the stomach like brain of fish. Generally, the eight types of diarrhea are only distinguished by heat and cold, red and white. Even though the properties of the medicines may differ, the treatment methods are not far apart. If there is a mix of red and white, first eliminate the heat accumulation by using medicines like rhubarb, bitter orange, and sodium sulfate to remove heat and toxins; then employ yellow bitter, bitter chrysanthemum, and berberine to resolve the heat, thus stopping the diarrhea and alleviating the pain—this is a wonderful method. If the diarrhea does not stop, use prepared ephedra and other medicines for regulation, and it will naturally return to normal."},{"anchor":"trans-9p","marker":"9p","type":"translation","text":"For those with spleen deficiency, it is unwise to lightly use substances like grain husks and similar agents, as this could lead to danger and distress.

For dysentery with a closed mouth and inability to eat, Shilian San is the principal prescription, and Xiangpu San is also applicable. For cold dysentery with symptoms like abdominal pain akin to bean juice, Weifeng Tang is the remedy. When there is spleen toxin and a hot condition with dysentery, one should often take Xianglian Wan, Huanglian Xiangru Drink, remove Gui from Wuling San, use Maogen Tang, and incorporate Danggui, Shaoyao, Zhiqiao, Diyu, Chuanxiong, and other prescriptions to first detoxify and reduce heat, then to stimulate appetite and consume food, facilitating the drainage of water and grains. To relieve intestinal pain and loosen the bowels, one should first use water-soaked Dan, Baidu San, Diyu Drink, and a laxative mixture with Zhiqiao. In cases of persistent diarrhea with heat, Sanhuang Shun Ai Tang is the main prescription. If there is obstruction due to accumulation, Shenxiong may also be utilized.

Additionally, it can be caused by a wet heat pathogen or by the nursing mother consuming excessive raw or overly rich foods and transmitting these effects. Symptoms arise also from the invasion of pathogenic factors like wind, warmth, and dampness. In cases where there is urgent abdominal pain, the nature of fire is rapid, which can dry out materials. Sometimes, at the end of summer or beginning of autumn, a sudden chill may invade internally without any means of dispersal, leading to conditions like malaria; if both internal and external symptoms manifest, it can result in dysentery-malaria. If dysentery persists for a long time, it can cause swelling and fullness, with the lower body being colder and the upper body having heat accumulation, resulting in a condition of excess above and deficiency below. In cases where there is damp heat toxicity affecting the spleen, it can lead to a blockage in the stomach, resulting in symptoms like locked jaw. There is also a possibility of family transmission, where the young and old show similar symptoms, indicating an epidemic dysentery. Treatment should first consider the seasonal changes to balance external factors, examine stagnation to regulate internal conditions, carefully assess the nature of injuries, and distinguish between excess and deficiency, as well as hot and cold conditions, to provide effective treatment without arbitrary interventions."},{"anchor":"trans-11p","marker":"11p","type":"translation","text":"**Red and White Dysentery** Regarding red and white dysentery, people generally say that red represents Yang and heat, while white represents Yin and cold; some even assert that without accumulation, dysentery cannot occur. However, when it comes to treatment, if one were to alternate between hot and cold medicines or use laxatives to remove accumulation, it would be difficult to achieve effective results. Without understanding the underlying causes, how can one expect to treat it? Moreover, during the changing of the seasons and among various winds, the interplay of the five movements and six atmospheres leads people to suffer from dysentery, particularly in summer and autumn. The \"Neijing\" states: \"In spring, one is harmed by wind; in summer, one suffers from diarrhea.\" The \"Treatise on True Principles\" says: \"Lesser Yang is in the springs, defeated by excessive fire, causing the populace to suffer from red and white dysentery.\" Can one strictly adhere to the idea that without accumulation, dysentery cannot occur? If one only considers accumulation, then is it not the case that during summer and autumn, many suffer from it, while in spring and winter, this is not the same? It is indeed the case that pathogenic wind enters the stomach, where wood can overcome earth. If it does not lead to violent diarrhea, it results in dysentery, characterized by a mixture of red and white, indicating a lack of distinction between Yin and Yang. The proper method should clarify the distinction between Yin and Yang, using Wuling San to guide the counterflow, and Lirong Tang to warm the stomach, allowing the colors to harmonize before applying treatment. If after this differentiation, red and white continue to descend together, then one must investigate the root cause of the ailment. If white appears first, followed by red, it indicates internal injury from cold, resulting from failing to keep covered, with the primal energy affected by summer heat. The treatment should first save the interior, followed by dispelling the heat toxin. If red appears first and is then followed by white, it indicates that heat has harmed first, followed by loss of coverage leading to cold. The priority should be to relieve the heat, then treat the dysentery."},{"anchor":"trans-12p","marker":"12p","type":"translation","text":"If there is a hot dysentery, it will expel pure fresh blood. This condition can cause blood movement, so it is advisable to take cold preparations such as Huanglian Xiangru San, Chuan Cao San, and Danggui San.

If there is a cold dysentery, it will expel pure white mucus, or it may appear pale with a hint of pink, or resemble purplish blood like that of a pig's liver. All these are signs of a yin condition, as cold can obstruct the blood. First, use Wuling San combined with Shouzhong Decoction and decoct it, then follow with Fuzi Lizhong Decoction and take it warm, or use Guzhen Decoction. If one cannot distinguish the deficiencies of yin and yang or the hot and cold conditions and mistakenly administer treatment, it will result in further weakening of the spleen and stomach, leading to an inability to digest food, or may even cause lockjaw dysentery, which is difficult to treat. Additionally, if there is urgency in the abdomen followed by heaviness at the back, it indicates urgency in the yang and heaviness in the yin. Abdominal pain before defecation indicates urgency, while pain after defecation indicates heaviness. Therefore, in cases of urgency, it is due to diarrhea in the large intestine. First, take Daxun Drink combined with Kuangqi Drink for resolution, along with Qianghuo San, prepared with ginger and millet water; then use Kuan Chang Wan. For heaviness, which indicates qi deficiency, combine Wuling San with ginseng and ginger and take as a decoction, and also administer Xianglian Wan. Ifboth conditions occur together, the first two pills can be administered together, or Baijin Drink or Jinsu Wan are also good options.

At this point, it is quite dangerous, especially with sharp abdominal pain, and those who are small children have no treatment method.

It comes from extreme intestinal weakness, causing both fat and blood to flow out together. The \"Shenghui\" states that in children, blood dysentery arises when heat and toxins affect the blood, which then enters the large intestine. The blood circulates along with Qi through the meridians and organs, and there is usually no stagnation. However, if influenced by poisonous heat, and if the intestines are weak where blood seeps into them, this will lead to blood dysentery.

When the blood heats up, it overflows and permeates into the large intestine, clashing with the fluids in the intestines, accumulating heat and becoming congealed. The blood transforms into pus; hence, if the abdomen is weak, diarrhea results, leading to pus and blood dysentery. The \"Ge Shi Zhu Hou\" states: children’s internal toxins stagnate like fish brains. **Five-Color Dysentery** The \"Xing Zheng Lun\" sings: Five-color dysentery has many manifestations; knowing this, one understands the five types. The blue color signifies shock and accumulation; yellow indicates excess food accumulation in the spleen. White signifies cold weakness in the intestines and stomach; red indicates intense accumulated heat that is difficult to pacify. Chicken liver hidden accumulation forms patches; with mixed black blood, it is hard to stabilize. Lips chapped, chest elevated, exposing teeth; the face red with veins protruding always in front. Urgently pacify the organs with herbal decoctions; physicians must pay attention as the ancient sages taught. Another song states: Do not regard five-color dysentery as strange; it appears in children under four years old. Blue arises from shock accumulation; yellow from food toxicity in the spleen. Red and black indicate heart and kidney issues; white indicates harm mainly to the spleen. Before the age of three, there is no fluctuation; do not allow excessive sleeping or late meals. This illness requires harmonizing the five organs and nourishing the defensive and nutritive qi for gradual recovery. If the eyes are swollen and the diet is not improved, only use Ping Wei San for supplementation."},{"anchor":"trans-17p","marker":"17p","type":"translation","text":"### Gū Lì (Dysentery) The \"Cháo Shì Bìng Yuán\" states: In children, gū poison dysentery occurs when seasonal changes in cold and heat are unregulated, leading to toxic and harmful qi. Children are weakened and hurt by it, with evils clashing against blood and qi, entering the intestines and stomach. Toxic qi accumulates; if the large intestine is vacuous, it transforms into dysentery with blood. The color of the dysentery resembles coagulated blood like pieces of chicken or duck liver, which accompanies the dysentery. This is due to the excess of toxic heat, affecting the internal organs, resembling gū poisoning; hence it is called gū toxin dysentery. The \"Shí Bì Jīng\" states that the song of the spleen toxin dysentery goes: \"Within the spleen, there is a toxin called pure yang. This is caused by the excessive heat from medicinal herbs hurting the body. It leads to many blockages in the large intestine and to abundant desiccated blood in the shriveled intestines. If the abdomen is windy and closed, it is hard to open one's eyes. The body heats up, the head feels warm, and the feet turn cold. The tongue is red and the chest is elevated—these are the signs to follow. There is much weeping and shortness of breath, resembling madness. First, one must resolve the heat and open the appetite. This is when good physicians apply their remedies.\" When the spleen suffers from heat accumulation and becomes toxic, the treatment should cool the spleen and then eliminate the accumulation. If the bones in the chest suddenly rise, leading to increased dyspnea, it is not treatable. The \"Fèng Suǐ Jīng\" annotation states: It is advisable to take Jīn Huá Sǎn and Xiāng Lián Wán. The \"Xíng Zhèng Lùn\" states that the wind toxin dysentery song highlights: \"Among the eight types of dysentery, the wind transforms with difficulty, appearing like the thick juice of green grass. The toxic wind mixes with bean juice, adding excessive heat. The stomach is ruined, resembling pieces of chicken liver. There is no need to first purgative the accumulation; closing the eyelids and completely avoiding food is unbearable to see. If it returns to white dysentery, it must be purged. The viscera and bowels should frequently be warmed to restore their original state.\""},{"anchor":"trans-18p","marker":"18p","type":"translation","text":"**Dysentery with Accompanying Symptoms** \"Chao's Disease Sources\" states: In children, dysentery accompanied by thirst indicates a watery dysentery. When fluids are depleted and the organs are weak and dry, it leads to increased thirst. If urination is frequent, dysentery ceases when thirst is relieved; if urination is scant, and fluids don’t move into the small intestine, but instead seep into the intestines and stomach, thirst persists and dysentery continues. In such cases, the body will appear swollen, as the spleen qi is too weak to manage fluids, leading to eye pain as well. Children generally have heat in the upper burner; now, with dysentery, the lower burner is weak and the upper burner is hot, resulting in excessive qi and heat affecting the liver. Mr. Mao believes food injury to the spleen and stomach is the cause, and suggests starting with \"Awakening the Spleen Powder\" and \"Harmony Qi Powder\" for adjustment. After a day, use \"Middle-Adjustment Drink\" with \"Milk Aroma Powder\" and \"Dragon Spit Paste\" to restore health. Alternatively, simply making a juice from winter melon may also help. **Emaciation** Chao states: In children, when the intestines and stomach are weak and affected by wind and cold, it leads to dysentery. After the dysentery resolves, the spleen and stomach remain weak, and qi from grains is still low, resulting in emaciation. **Swelling** \"Huiji\" discusses the case of children experiencing swelling all over after dysentery. The verse states: \"If cold dysentery is untreated for long, widespread swelling occurs as if blown up. A strong pulse indicates qi has turned to water, and firmness arises from accumulations.\" The best method is to smooth the qi to reduce swelling; after balancing qi for two days, frequent urination will establish. Avoid overeating to prevent stagnation, as this condition fundamentally stems from the damage to the spleen."},{"anchor":"trans-19p","marker":"19p","type":"translation","text":"**Prolapse of the Anus** The lungs and the large intestine are interrelated. The anus is the entrance of the large intestine. When the lungs are excessively hot, they obstruct and block; when the lungs are weak and cold, the rectum may protrude. This condition can arise from prolonged dysentery, resulting in urgency and forceful straining of the anus, which may be exposed to external wind, or from heat-induced diarrhea, where the intestines become loose and uncontrollable. Alternatively, a constitution that is frail and weak can easily succumb to cold, leading to prolapse of the large intestine. In children, diarrhea and dysentery are often caused by damp heat and wind-heat, which take advantage of a weakened spleen and stomach. Wind belongs to wood, and wood conquering suppresses earth, which governs the spleen and stomach—when they are weakened, they are easily subdued. Moreover, dampness tends to harm the spleen, and due to this weakness, it cannot discern the clear from the turbid. When food and water mix improperly, it results in profuse leakage; when this persists, the large intestine becomes weak. The large intestine is associated with the hand yangming metal; however, if earth is weak, it cannot generate metal. Once the energy of metal becomes deficient, the pathways of transmission are also weakened and may be struck by cold wind, causing the anus to prolapse and fail to retract. The treatment should aim to nourish the spleen and warm the stomach, allowing the metal to benefit from its mother and restore its energy. Formulas like Huo Xiang Tang, Yun Qi San, and Ping Wei San are advised. Subsequently, internal remedies to fortify the intestines can be given, such as Jian Pi Yin and Yang Zang Tang. Externally, methods like application of Fu Long Gan San and Bi Ma Gao at the rectal area can be used to uplift energy and encourage retraction; if retraction is achieved, wash off the remaining substances with water.
