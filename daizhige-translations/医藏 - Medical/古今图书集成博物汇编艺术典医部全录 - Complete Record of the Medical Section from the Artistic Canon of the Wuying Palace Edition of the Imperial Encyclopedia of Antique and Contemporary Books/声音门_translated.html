      <div><p><strong>The Complete Collection of Books from Antiquity to the Present: Volume 324</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section on Sound</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Subtlety of Pulses</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse of the heart is strong and long, the person will experience a rolled tongue and be unable to speak.<br><em>[Note: A strong and long pulse indicates excessive pulsation, which results from excessive heart fire. Since the heart governs speech, this leads to an inability to speak.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Five Evils</strong></p>
<p>If one is disturbed by the Five Evils, an obstruction to the yin causes silence.<br><em>[Note: The Foot Shaoyin is connected to the tongue, linked to the horizontal bone, and ultimately reaches the epiglottis. When the evil obstructs the yin, the epiglottis cannot move, leading to an inability to vocalize, thus resulting in silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On Rare Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: If a person is burdened and remains silent for nine months, what is the reason for this? Qibo answered: The meridian of the womb is severed. The womb&#39;s meridian is connected to the kidneys, the pulse of the Shaoyin passes through the kidneys and connects to the root of the tongue, which is why they cannot speak. The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qibo replied: There is no treatment; they will recover after ten months.<br><em>[Note: After ten months, when the fetus is delivered, the womb&#39;s meridian will be restored and the voice will return.]</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Great Oddities</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse does not arrive, it is like being mute; without treatment, it will resolve itself.<br>[Note: When the pulse is blocked, sound cannot be produced. When the pulse is unblocked, sound naturally recovers. Therefore, when the pulse does not arrive and one is mute, there is no need for treatment, as the illness will resolve on its own. This is related to the blockage of the meridians and differs from being mute due to external factors.]</p>
<p>The stomach pulse is deep, beating strongly but unevenly, while the heart pulse is small, firm, and urgent, indicating a deficiency in the liver. Men show signs on the left, women on the right. If one is mute but can turn the tongue, treatment is possible, starting after thirty days. If the follower is mute, it begins after three years. Those under twenty years of age tend to die within three years.<br>[Note: In the yangming channel, both qi and blood are abundant, so the pulse should be floating and large. Now, if the pulse is deep and beating unevenly, this indicates a deficiency of blood and qi within. If the pulse is large, it signifies a deficiency of blood and qi externally. Qi from the nourishment and defense must flow from the inner organs to the physical body; if it is insufficient, the qi in the channels becomes deficient, resulting in numbness and paralysis between the chest, ribs, and back. &quot;Liver&quot; here signifies deficiency. Although qi and blood from nourishment and defense arise in yangming and are governed by the heart, their origin is in the kidneys, which are pre-natal. The lesser yin meridians connect to the origin of qi at the root of the tongue; if the tongue can turn and is not mute, the primordial qi remains uninjured, thus treatment is possible. The distinctions of men showing signs on the left and women on the right indicate that while the blood and qi of yin and yang are balanced, if mute, it will take three years to recover. However, if one is under twenty and shows this abnormality, their organs are robust and their blood and qi are plentiful; contrary symptoms may arise, leading to a gradual depletion of qi in the five organs and six intestines, ultimately resulting in death within three years.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Abdominal Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: There is illness with swelling in the throat and pain, fullness in the chest and bloating in the abdomen; what illness is this? How does one acquire it? Qibo replied: It is called &quot;counterflow.&quot; The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qibo said: If you use moxibustion, it leads to muteness; if you use stones, it leads to mania. It is necessary that the qi is harmonized before it can be treated. The Emperor asked: Why is this so? Qibo explained: The yang qi rises excessively above; if moxibustion is applied, the yang qi enters the yin, leading to muteness. If stones are used, the yang qi becomes depleted, and when depleted, it leads to mania. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The rising of the yang qi and the counterflow of abdominal qi towards above indicate an excess in the upper parts; thus, if moxibustion is applied, the hot yang qi enters the yin and results in muteness. If stones are used, the yang qi leaks out and becomes depleted, resulting in mania. It is essential that the counterflow qi and blood are harmonized before treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Pulses</strong></p>
<p>The so-called muteness caused by the taiyang (greater yang) means that the yang has become overly vigorous and then diminished, leading to muteness. When the internal qi is depleted and counterflown, it results in sudden muteness; this indicates kidney deficiency. If the shaoyin (lesser yin) does not reach, it leads to counterflow. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The muteness caused by internal qi being depleted indicates that the yang has become overly vigorous and then diminished; if the internal qi is insufficient, it results in yin deficiency and muteness. When yang receives qi from the extremities, if the yang becomes overly vigorous and then diminishes, the limbs fail to retract, resulting in sudden onset. Kidney qi insufficiency leads to muteness due to lack of shaoyin qi, causing coldness in the hands and feet.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Qi Transformation</strong></p>
<p>When the yearly fire energy is insufficient, cold prevails greatly, and the people suffer from sudden muteness.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The coldness of water affects the heart, which governs speech; therefore, it leads to sudden muteness.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>
<h3>A Discourse on the Ultimate Truth</h3>
<p>The Emperor asked: How does the revival of the six energies manifest? Qi Bo replied: The revival of the Shao Yin is marked by sudden silence. </p>
<h3>The Spirit Pivot Classic</h3>
<h4>On the Forms of Disease in the Organs from Evil Qi</h4>
<p>If the heart&#39;s pulse is blocked, it results in significant silence. </p>
<h4>On the Meridians</h4>
<p>The branch of the Hand Shao Yin, named Tong Li, runs through the meridian into the heart, connects to the root of the tongue, and is associated with the eye. In its essence, it influences the diaphragm; if it is empty, it cannot articulate. </p>
<p>The branch of the Foot Yang Ming, called Feng Long, runs along the outer edge of the tibia, ascends to connect with the head and neck, and links to the energies of various meridians, descending to connect with the throat. If the evil energy reverses, it leads to throat obstruction and sudden silence. </p>
<p>The branch of Yang Ming connects with the meridian at Feng Long and diverges to the branch of the Foot Tai Yin. This branch travels along the outer edge of the tibia and ascends to the head and neck. All the vital energies and blood of the fifteen major branches originate from what is generated in the stomach and intestines from food and drink. Therefore, the branch of the Foot Yang Ming should connect with the energies of all meridians; when the silent energy reverses, it causes throat obstruction, relating to the branch of the meridian in the throat.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Sudden Anxiety and Anger</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked the Master of the Lesser Knowledge: &quot;When a person suddenly feels anxiety and anger but has no voice, what causes this blockage? What obstructs the energy, preventing sound from manifesting? I wish to know the remedy.&quot; The Master of the Lesser Knowledge replied: &quot;The throat is the passage for food and water. The throat is where qi moves up and down. The epiglottis is the doorway for sound. The lips and teeth are the fan for sound. The tongue is the instrument for sound. The uvula is the gate of sound. The nostrils are where the qi escapes. The horizontal bone governs the spirit’s qi and directs the tongue. Therefore, when the nasal passages discharge and are uncontained, the nostrils are not open, and the flow of qi is lost. Thus, when the epiglottis is small and thin, qi escapes quickly, and the opening and closing are beneficial, making the exhalation easy; when the epiglottis is large and thick, the opening and closing are difficult, and the exhalation is slow, leading to heavy speech. When a person suddenly has no voice, it is because cold qi invades the epiglottis, preventing it from functioning, so sound cannot be produced or descend, resulting in a lack of voice.&quot; </p>
<p><em>Note: The lungs govern sound, the heart governs speech, the liver governs language; yet this is expressed through the qi from the lesser yin kidney.</em><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Therefore, the wise ruler assesses those who have sound but unclear speech and should hold their heart and liver accountable; those who can speak but produce no sound should be held responsible for their spleen and lungs; those who cannot speak and have no sound suffer from a reversal of kidney energy. Worry harms the lungs; when the lungs are harmed, there will be no sound. Anger injures the liver; when the liver is hurt, speech becomes unclear. This is the gateway of sound, referring to the expression of vibrational energy coming forth. When the lips open and close, only then are speech and clarity achieved, thus operating as the fan of sound. When the tongue moves, speech can be produced, functioning as the mechanism of sound. The hanging soft palate is the barrier for sound. The nasal cavity connects the airflow of the mouth and nose, facilitating the release of breath, so this is where the energy is divided and emitted through the mouth and nose. The horizontal bone allows spirit and energy to flow in and out, thus controlling the articulation of speech. If the nose cannot expel mucus, it is because the soft palate is not open, leading to a loss of breath division. The epiglottis serves to open and close and mediates the passage of sound and energy. If it is thin, sound is produced quickly; if it is thick, the opening and closing are difficult, delaying the exit of energy, resulting in heavy speech. The presence of cold energy corresponds to the cold water energy of the lesser yin. The channel of the lesser yin is connected to the tongue, linked to the horizontal bone, reaching the epiglottis. When the vital energy rises, sound can be emitted. If cold energy affects the epiglottis, it cannot open; if it cannot open, it cannot close. Thus, if the mechanisms of opening and closing fail, there will be no sound.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Nine Needle Theory</strong></p>
<p>Evil enters the Yin, transforming into silence.<br>[Note: This refers to evil entering the Yin of the kidneys, then shifting into the Yang of the heart, leading to silence.]<br><strong>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classic</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unhealed Symptoms</strong><a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>The patient whose Yin and Yang are both depleted, and who loses their voice and cannot speak, will die in three and a half days.<br>— From &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; by Sun Simiao, Tang Dynasty</p>
<p>In cases where the wind-cold qi lingers in the body and does not disperse, resulting in loss of voice, it is advisable to take medications that help expel this condition, rather than treating the loss of voice directly.<br>— From &quot;Direct Guide to Benevolent Study&quot; by Yang Dengfu, Song Dynasty</p>
<p>When a great shock enters the heart, it obstructs blood and stubborn phlegm, filling the heart&#39;s channels, thus leading to loss of voice. It is advisable to use medicinals like Mitoseng San, Yuanzhi Wan, and Fushen San.  </p>
<p>The heart is the master of sound, the lungs are the gate of sound, and the kidneys are the root of sound. Factors like wind, cold, heat, damp, and phlegm-heat, as well as pathogenic influences affecting the heart and lungs, can lead to illness in the upper body; treat according to the symptoms, and as the pathogenic influences disperse, the natural sounds will emerge again. However, if the illness arises from kidney deficiency, it can’t properly absorb the qi to return to the source, thus causing qi to rebel upwards, leading to coughs and clogs, which negatively impact the chest, abdomen, and entire body. This results in increasing severity of the cough, decreasing strength of the qi, and dryness of the voice.<br>— From &quot;Discussion on Guiding Misdirection&quot; by Qian Yi, Song Dynasty</p>
<p>The symptoms of kidney deficiency are similar to loss of voice. After vomiting, diarrhea, or major illnesses, even if there is sound, the person cannot speak, and if they do not take medicine, this is not a true loss of voice, but rather due to kidney deficiency failing to connect with the Yang. Hence, kidney tonification is necessary, primarily with Di Huang Wan. True loss of voice is simply due to sudden onset from wind-cold.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>The Six Writings of Hejian by Jin Liu Wanshu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unable to Speak</strong></p>
<p>When the kidneys are deficient and internal energy is exhausted, one becomes mute. It is due to the lack of internal energy causing syncope; the tongue is mute and unable to speak, the legs are incapacitated and not functional. The kidneys&#39; channels are weak, causing a lack of vital energy, and hence the tongue becomes insensitive. The scriptures state that when one is mute and the feet are unresponsive, the remedy is the Rehmannia Decoction. If one experiences dryness, it is because metal (lungs) is the root of this condition; dry metal heated transforms into dryness and exhaustion. In conjunction with heat, it leads to the impairment of metal, depleting fluids and damaging blood, becoming stagnant and resulting in dryness. This occurs because wind can overcome damp heat which consumes fluids; thus, the scriptures say that wind, heat, and fire are all yang, while cold, dampness, and dryness belong to yin. Furthermore, dry and damp are slightly different; although metal and dryness belong to autumn yin, their nature differs from cold and damp, aligning instead with wind, heat, and fire. Additionally, when the stool is dry and hard, it indicates the large intestine has been heated, turning it dry and firm. The scripture mentions various states of dryness and hardening. Similarly, paralysis and strokes occur due to heat consuming blood, leading to blockage and an inability to moisten. The metal suffers from heat stagnation, causing inability to produce sound, as the lungs govern voice. Pain and weakness in limbs result from the clash of wind, heat, and damp, resulting in unilateral atrophy, muddled speech, and limbs not following. Coldness in the center, vomiting, and diarrhea lead to loss of fluids and dryness, which is also noteworthy. There can also be oppression from cold and dampness that obstructs the nourishing and protective systems, leading to increased atrophy. The scriptures state: &quot;All that is dry, hard, and withered belongs to dryness.&quot;<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Sudden Loss of Voice</strong></p>
<p>Sudden loss of voice refers to a sudden muteness. The lungs, associated with metal, govern sound; thus, in the five elements, only metal can resonate. Metal corresponds to the heavens, which are yang, vigorous, and dynamic; metal is inherently dry, reclusive, and contained, strong and pure, so those who can produce sound do not exceed this principle. All vocal sounds arise from the impact of one’s physical energy. Such impact is the application of vigor and movement. As for things that can produce sound when cold, water indeed restrains fire; fire cannot overcome metal. If fire is strong and water weak, and heat overwhelms the lung metal, resulting in muddied spirit and stagnant energy, then sudden muteness occurs. It is stated in the classics: when internal withdrawal occurs, it leads to muteness, which is related to kidney deficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding Women’s Heaviness</strong></p>
<p>When women are nine months pregnant, if they are mute and cannot speak, it indicates that the channels of the bladder are not connected, preventing them from speaking. The texts say: it is not treatable. However, despite this perspective, one can prepare two taels of jade candle decoction, boil it with one bowl of water until reduced to seven parts, strain, allow to cool, and add a little honey to sip occasionally. This will lower the heart fire and clear the lung metal, thus enabling speech.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method (Yuan - Zhu Zhenxiang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Differentiating Causes in Medical Canon</strong></p>
<p>The channel of the foot&#39;s Shaoyin passes through the root of the tongue, the channel of the foot&#39;s Taiyin connects to the root of the tongue, and the separate channel of the hand&#39;s Shaoyin is linked to the root of the tongue. Therefore, when these three channels are deficient, phlegm and saliva take advantage of the deficiency, blocking their pathways, causing the tongue to be unable to articulate speech. If these three channels lack blood, the tongue is without the nourishing blood, hence treatment should focus on replenishing blood. Furthermore, if the three channels are disturbed by wind-heat, the tongue&#39;s channel becomes relaxed; if affected by wind-cold, the tongue&#39;s channel becomes tense and urgent.

<p><strong>Deficiency and Diminishment</strong></p>
<p>When there is exhaustion and pallor, with insufficient qi and blood, resulting in a loss of voice and prolonged muteness, it is advisable to take Tianzhen Pills. After taking them for half a month, speech will naturally return.</p>

<p><strong>Two Causes of Illness</strong></p>
<p>For those who are mute, it is due to malevolent influences entering the yin areas. The text states: &quot;When malevolent influences strike the yin, it results in muteness.&quot; It also states: &quot;When malevolent influences enter the yin and create obstruction, it leads to muteness.&quot; There are two conditions: one is tongue muteness, which is related to wind stroke affecting the tongue&#39;s ability to articulate. Here the tongue itself cannot express speech, but the voice from the throat remains as before. The second is throat muteness, which is related to excessive coughing causing loss of voice. In this case, the voice becomes hoarse from the throat, while the tongue still retains its ability to articulate speech.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<h3>Introduction to Medicine (Ming, Li Chan)</h3>
<h4>Diagnosis and Treatment</h4>
<p>For those with deficiency of Qi and blood, or kidney deficiency, and elderly patients suddenly unable to speak, it is advisable to use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang by removing the cinnamon and adding Acorus calamus and Polygala. For those with phlegm obstruction leading to mutism, it is suitable to use Dan Tan Tang, adding Acorus calamus, bamboo shavings, and ginseng, or Scutellaria and Coptis. In cases of loss of blood leading to mutism, Si Wu Tang should be used, along with ginseng, white atractylodes, dried tangerine peel, licorice, Acorus calamus, and Polygala.</p>

<h3>Ancient and Modern Medical Principles (Ming, Xu Chunfu)</h3>
<h4>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</h4>
<p>Sound is associated with the interaction of the five internal organs and its diseases stem from the six Qi. The &quot;Jin Kui Zhen Yan&quot; states: the eastern blue corresponds to the liver, its sound is the horn, its tone is a call. The southern red corresponds to the heart, its sound is the zheng, its tone is a laugh. The central yellow corresponds to the spleen, its sound is the palace, its tone is a song. The western white corresponds to the lungs, its sound is the商, its tone is a cry. The northern black corresponds to the kidneys, its sound is the feather, its tone is a moan. This is why sounds are linked to the five internal organs. The &quot;Zhi Zhi&quot; states: the heart is the master of sound, the lung is the door to sound, and the kidney is the root of sound, which emphasizes their importance.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The tongue is the sprout of the heart; if the heart&#39;s ailment cannot be transformed by the tongue, then one cannot speak. Those suffering from acute illnesses can still be treated, but those with chronic conditions cannot be cured. Therefore, the heart is the master of sound. The lungs belong to metal, governing clarity and purification, externally controlling the skin and pores. When wind and cold attack from outside, and heat accumulates within, the lung&#39;s metal becomes unclear, leading to coughing and hoarseness. Hence, the lungs are the gateway to sound. The kidneys are the root of the body, the master of the original qi. If kidney qi is deficient, the original qi gradually weakens, leading to speechlessness. The classics state: speaking softly and then regaining the ability to speak all day signifies a loss of qi. According to the Qian family&#39;s treatment, for children who vomit, have diarrhea, and excessive urination, which leads to spleen deficiency and loss of appetite, the use of Yihuang powder is effective. After several days of treatment, if the child suddenly becomes mute, it indicates that the spleen&#39;s energy has recovered but the kidney qi remains insufficient. Administering Dihuang pills to nourish the kidneys, in several doses, will enable the child to speak again, thus confirming that the root of sound indeed springs from the kidneys.</p>
<p>The causes of illness can be divided into three:</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal: There is internal heat, phlegm obstructing the lung&#39;s metal, leading to hoarseness or loss of voice, and long-term coughing that exhausts the qi.</li>
<li>External: Exposure to wind and cold, causing closure of the pores and external cold binding, leading to cough and hoarseness; treatments like San&#39;ao Decoction belong to this external cause. Additionally, sudden exposure to wind can cause a loss of voice, which is also an external cause.</li>
<li>Mixed: Due to loud arguing or shouting, leading to loss of voice, or singing leading to qi injury, which is not strictly an internal or external cause; rest and nourishment can lead to self-healing.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Understanding the Six Pathogenic Factors</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Wind, cold, dryness, and heat, which lead to indistinct sounds—people generally recognize these. However, the influence of summer heat and dampness is less understood. The classics say: &quot;When affected by dampness, the head feels wrapped, and the voice seems as though it comes from within a room,&quot; referring to the dampness in the qi. The &quot;Direct Pointing&quot; states: Wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, fire, phlegm, and qi affecting the heart and lungs can cause disease in the upper abdomen; treat the symptoms accordingly, and once the evil qi is dispersed, the natural sounds will resonate once more. </p>
<p>However, when kidney deficiency is the root of the disease, it fails to gather the various qi back to the source, causing the qi to rush upward, resulting in coughing, phlegm obstruction, possible wheezing or bloating, cold feet, chronic weakness, and pulling sensations throughout the chest and abdomen; as the cough worsens, the qi wanes, and the voice becomes increasingly dry. A wise individual should address the site of the illness.</p>
<p>For coughs due to wind and cold leading to loss of voice, the San Yao Decoction is the remedy. For excess heat and phlegm obstructing the voice, use salt water to induce vomiting. In cases of hard stool blockage in the large intestine, causing an inability to release sounds or qi, administer the Da Chai Hu Decoction. These remedies are tailored to the individual’s symptoms, acting as effective treatments.</p>
<p>In general, if a patient has a persistent cough and a hoarse voice, it indicates a deficiency of original qi and insufficient lung qi. It is advisable to replenish qi, nourish metal, and moisten dryness, allowing the voice to recover naturally. For individuals with deficiency due to prolonged illness, it is important to nourish kidney water and moisten lung metal as a foundation, employing herbs like Haritaki in various decoctions to consolidate treatment. </p>
<p>By addressing both the root and branch of the problem, this approach is comprehensive. If a long-term patient remains mute, it signifies a total depletion of heart qi, which may lead to death.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical References</strong> (Ming, Gong Xin)</p>
<p><strong>Stroke and Loss of Voice</strong></p>
<p>In cases of stroke, where one maintains normal eating, sitting, and lying down but loses the ability to speak, this is commonly referred to as &quot;mute stroke.&quot; To remedy this, one can use a decoction with Wu Tou (Aconite) and add one qian (about 3 grams) of Shi Chang Pu (Acorus), or a recipe for He Zi (Terminalia chebula) to clear the voice. However, the inability to speak may have various causes: there may be a strong tongue yet unable to articulate, disorientation preventing speech, a tightly shut mouth, or a tongue that can articulate but slurred. Treatment should address phlegm, wind, calmness, and nourishing qi and blood, each requiring tailored approaches beyond merely relying on Wu Tou or He Zi.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Compendium of Materia Medica</strong> [Ming, Li Shizhen]<br><strong>Miscellaneous Symptoms</strong><br>Loss of voice can occur due to lung heat, pulmonary atrophy, or the invasion of wind toxins into the lungs, as well as from parasitic infections in the lungs; it may be caused by cold combined with heat, or by demonic possession; or it may manifest as loss of voice and inability to speak, with a strong tongue yet silent; or it could be due to phlegm obstruction; or from kidney deficiency causing mutism.  </p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Treatise</strong> [Ming, Zhang Jieben]<br><strong>Discussion on Symptoms</strong><br>Voice originates from the Qi of the viscera. When the viscera are in excess, the voice is loud; when they are deficient, the voice is weak. Therefore, diseases of any of the five viscera can lead to mutism. For instance, prolonged worry and anxiety leading to mutism is a heart condition; sudden mutism caused by shock, fear, or anger is a liver condition; or when wind and cold affect the skin and fire disturbs the lungs, leading to coughing and eventually mutism, it is a lung condition; when mutism arises from hunger or fatigue, causing a failure of the middle Qi, it is a spleen condition; as for excessive indulgence in alcohol and lust, burning the yin and stealing Qi from the yang, leading to exhaustion and dehydration of the lung, dryness, and prolonged coughing resulting in mutism, this is due to the kidney&#39;s water being dried up. Thus, all five viscera can cause mutism, and this summarizes their potential causes.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The tongue is the seed of the heart; when the heart is ill, the tongue cannot articulate. The heart is the master of sound. Sound emerges from qi; when the lungs are sick, qi is depleted. Thus, qi is the gateway of sound. The kidneys store essence; essence transforms into qi. When yin is deficient, there is no qi; thus, the kidneys are the root of sound. </p>
<p>The Classics say: &quot;When speech is subtle, and one speaks again only after a whole day, this is a depletion of qi; how much more so for one who is silent?&quot; It is understood that ailments of sound arise from the five organs, but they fundamentally depend on the spirit of the heart, the qi of the lungs, and the essence of the kidneys—these three are its masters.</p>
<p>However, the kidneys are considered the foundational root, the source from which original qi is born. Hence, essence transforms into qi, and qi transforms into spirit. If kidney qi is depleted, the original yang gradually weakens. Therefore, while the external manifestations of sound are in the heart and lungs, its essence lies in the kidneys. The Classics state: &quot;When yang is strong yet begins to decline, it leads to muteness.&quot; If there is internal depletion leading to collapse, it results in muteness, indicating kidney deficiency.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Indeed, the kidneys are the root of sound, and this is no mistake. In cases of muteness, one must understand the distinction between deficiency and excess. For excess, the illness is in the manifestation; it is caused by closed orifices, leading to muteness. For deficiency, the illness is rooted; it is caused by internal deprivation, leading to muteness. </p>
<p>When the orifices are closed, it can be due to wind and cold obstructing, which is an external condition. It can also be due to fire pathogens obstructing, which leads to heat affecting the lungs. It can be due to reversed qi, leading to liver stagnation. When it is due to wind obstruction, it can be dispersed and resolved; when it is due to fire obstruction, it can be cleared and resolved; when it is due to qi obstruction, it can be regulated and resolved. These are all conditions of excessive pathogens that are relatively easy to treat.</p>
<p>As for the obstruction caused by phlegm and fluids, although it may be said to be both deficient and excessive, without treatment to regulate, how could phlegm-heat become so severe? It is more often the case that there is more deficiency than excess, and one must discern the nature of the pathogens and the urgency of treatment.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>Those who are internally deprived experience various forms of loss: the loss due to lust damages the kidneys; the loss due to worry and contemplation injures the heart; the loss due to great fright harms the gallbladder; and the loss from hunger, malnutrition, and fatigue affects the spleen. These are not individual pursuits, but rather a major supplement to vital energy. Can one expect the broken to return to completeness or the damaged to regain vitality? These are all difficult issues caused by emptiness and evil. </p>
<p>However, while distinguishing between difficulty and ease is essential, there is also a necessity to distinguish between duration and temporality, as well as the underlying causes of illnesses. This clarity is vital. Things that are temporary and near are easier to treat, while those that are gradual and prolonged are more difficult. A pulse that is slow and slippery is easier to handle, while a thin and rapid pulse is more challenging. Conditions that have not sustained injury are easier to treat, but those burdened with accumulated fatigue are harder. Immediate results from a few doses are easier, while a long-term medication with no effect is much more difficult.</p>
<p>Additionally, responses such as crying, singing, or lamenting, or situations involving extreme heat followed by consuming cold water, or sudden exposure to cold wind leading to hoarseness, fall under the category of easier cases. In these instances, simply knowing to nurture and rest can lead to recovery without the need for medication. These distinctions must be recognized.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p>
<h3>On Governance</h3>
<p>When wind and cold invade the skin and fur, causing internal heat to become obstructed, leading to an unclear lung metal and a blocked throat, resulting in severe coughing and hoarseness, one should use remedies such as Shen Su Decoction, Er Chen Decoction, Xiao Qing Long Decoction, Jin Shui Liu Jun Decoction, and San Yao Decoction to disperse it. </p>
<p>If fire pathogens invade the lungs, causing excessive heat in the upper burner and leading to hoarseness, one should use Si Yin Decoction or Mai Men Dong Decoction. For excessive heart fire, Er Yin Decoction is appropriate. If there is stomach fire rising, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction. For excessive liver and gallbladder fire, remedies like Chai Hu Qing Gan Decoction should be used. </p>
<p>In cases of fatigue-related sputum cough accompanied by fire, Bamboo Leaf and Mai Men Dong Decoction is suitable. If liver pathogens cause reversed qi leading to hoarseness, one should use Xiao Jiang Qi Decoction, Run Xia Pill, or Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>For sputum qi stagnation leading to hoarseness, remedies like Er Chen Decoction, Liu An Decoction, Bei Mu Pill, or Run Xia Pill can be used to treat the symptoms. One may also use salty decoction to induce vomiting. If there is excessive weak phlegm or phlegm fire, treatment should be considered according to the principles of phlegm and drink. </p>
<p>For hoarseness caused by deficiency, this condition is the most common among voice disorders and should be carefully differentiated and treated.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>For those whose sexual desires harm the yin and who are ill in the kidneys, one should use remedies like Six-Flavor Pill, Eight-Flavor Pill, Left Return Pill, Right Return Pill, Ginseng Lung-Soothing Decoction, and Great Yuan-Tonifying Decoction. If there is concomitant lung fire, one should select and use remedies such as One Yin Decoction, Four Yin Decoction, and Ginseng Root Strengthening Pill.</p>
<p>For those experiencing great shock or fear, which suddenly leads to loss of voice, the liver and gallbladder have been harmed. This can be treated with remedies like Seven Blessings Drink, Five Blessings Drink, Ten-Flavor Warming Gallbladder Decoction, Calming Heart and Nourishing Pills, and Settling Will Pill.</p>
<p>For those who suffer from hunger, exhaustion, and fatigue leading to a severe loss of middle qi and loss of voice, this illness resides in the spleen. Use remedies such as Spleen-Nourishing Decoction, Li Yin Decoction, Tonifying the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction, Yin-Replenishing and Qi-Enhancing Decoction, and Warming the Stomach Drink.</p>
<p>For those whose excessive worry and thinking have harmed the heart and spleen, leading to loss of voice, use remedies like Seven Blessings Drink and Spleen-Nourishing Decoction.</p>
<p>For patients with a long-term cough and hoarseness, this is due to severe harm to the yuan qi, with both lungs and kidneys being depleted. One should focus on nourishing lung qi, replenishing kidney water, and moisturizing dryness; the voice will naturally return. Alternatively, one can slightly add Gorgon Fruit and Herbal Decoction to tighten and treat the symptoms, emphasizing the importance of nurturing the root before addressing the branches in order to maintain health. If one mistakenly uses excessive cold remedies for false heat, or recklessly depletes for abundant phlegm, there will be no exceptions.</p>
<p>For those suffering from wind toxins or throat abscesses who, after recovery, still cannot speak, this condition arises from an obstruction that has already caused damage; even if the voice is lost, it is not harmful and does not require treatment.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>Fang</p>

<p>The &quot;Lingshu Jing&quot; states: For fullness in the chest and swelling of the face, with lips feeling dry, and severe difficulty in speech, treat the foot yangming. If qi ascends to the throat and speech is impossible, with hands and feet feeling clear and difficulty in bowel movements, treat the foot shao-yin. For sudden mutism and obstruction of qi, treat the futu point and cause bleeding at the root of the tongue.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>The disease of prickly heat presents with no pain in the body, the limbs do not contract, the mind is in disorder, and speech is faint, indicating that it can be treated. In severe cases, the patient cannot speak, signifying that it is untreatable. The illness first arises from Yang and subsequently enters Yin; thus, one should first address the Yang and then the Yin, taking from the surface.</p>
<p>The spleen corresponds to the channel of the Greater Yin. When one is active, the tongue at its root becomes strong. If pronounced, it should be drained; if deficient, it should be supplemented; if hot, it should be treated urgently; if cold, it should be retained; and if it sinks, it should be moxibusted.</p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Lesser Yin channel is called Tongli, located 1.5 inches above the wrist. It branches upwards into the heart and connects to the root of the tongue; if deficient, speech becomes impaired, and one should take from one inch behind the palm.</p>
<p>The foot&#39;s Yangming channel is called Fenglong, located 8 inches above the ankle. It branches to the Greater Yin, connecting to the throat. If there is adverse Qi, it leads to throat obstruction and sudden muteness, and one should take from its branch.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked the Lesser Teacher, &quot;What causes sudden worry or anger leading to speechlessness? What blockage occurs that prevents sound from manifesting?&quot; The Lesser Teacher replied, &quot;When cold Qi invades the throat, it cannot express; it fails to descend, and its opening and closing do not function properly, hence the absence of sound.&quot; </p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor inquired further, &quot;How should one treat this?&quot; Qi Bo responded, &quot;The Lesser Yin of the foot links to the tongue, connects to the horizontal bone, and ends at the epiglottis. By draining its blood vessels, the turbid Qi can be dispelled. The channel at the epiglottis connects to the Ren channel; take from Tiantu, and that will allow for expression.&quot;</p>

The &quot;Zisheng Fang&quot; states: If the tongue is slow and cannot speak, one should stimulate the mute gate. If the tongue is swollen and difficult to speak, one should stimulate the lianquan point.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Baosheng Miyao&quot; states: For the method of guiding voice loss, push the area from the heart to the navel, envision the kidney water rising to moisten the lungs, and breathe back to the dantian to regulate the breath. When speech is impossible, first open the lung meridian, move the kidney water to cleanse the heart and lungs, and then stimulate the sides of the tongue. The lungs are like an umbrella, returning to the heart. Those who cannot speak suffer from excess fire drying the lungs; only kidney water can moisten them.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Xinfa&quot; states: A person suffers from a dry cough and voice hoarseness, administered with two qian of baizhu, one and a half qian each of ginseng and tangerine peel, one qian of banxiaqu, seven fen each of bai fuling, mulberry bark, and tianmendong, three fen each of licorice and green peel, twenty seeds of wuweizi, and five fen each of zhimu, dibo, (caotong) louchong, and jingbai. Prepare as one dose, adding three slices of ginger for decoction; continue with the four substance decoction combined with child’s urine, bamboo juice, ginger juice, and stir-fried huanglian, taking the two medicines alternately day and night. After two months, the voice returned and the patient was cured.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>Yu Jidao experienced a loss of essence and mistakenly took ginseng and astragalus along with a floating agent, leading to a blockage in the upper jiao that caused him to become mute. To remedy this, a powder made from fragrant attached and young boy&#39;s urine was used as a treatment to clear the upper jiao and restore speech. Additionally, he employed clam powder and indigo as the main ingredients, supplemented with phellodendron, anemarrhena, and fragrant attached to create a pill, which was administered to address the loss of essence by reinforcing the lower jiao. After more than ten days, he fully recovered.</p>
<p>The &quot;Sun Zhao&#39;s Formula&quot; states: The inner official Cao had a new house constructed and moved in after half a month. After drinking heavily, he lost his voice and could not speak. Sun employed the Heart-Strengthening Yam Pill combined with asarum and ligusticum to treat dampness. After ten days, his condition gradually improved, and he was completely healed after twenty days. When Cao saw the emperor, he was asked who treated him. He replied it was Sun Zhao, the physician. The emperor then inquired about Cao&#39;s ailment. The response was: The walls of the newly built house were damp, and the ground was very shady. When a person first arrives, the yin energy has not dissipated. Cao&#39;s heart energy was originally weak, and after drinking to excess, all his pores opened, allowing the dampness to enter and affect the pericardium. The pericardium being already deficient, the dampness further invaded it, which is why he could not speak. I first used the yam pill to strengthen the heart energy, and then applied ligusticum and asarum to eliminate the dampness, thus enabling him to speak.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: If a person&#39;s tongue is short, their speech is unclear, which indicates that phlegm and saliva are blocking the channels at the root of the tongue. I once treated a middle-aged man with a febrile illness, who was given five doses of herbs for febrile conditions. Afterward, he fell into a state of confusion and became mute. I diagnosed it as a case of deficiency with phlegm. I prescribed five qian of ginseng, one qian each of astragalus, white atractylodes, angelica, and aged tangerine peel, boiled in a decoction, mixed with bamboo sap and ginger juice for him to drink. After twelve days, he could utter one word; after another half month of taking the remedy, his ability to articulate gradually improved, and his heat was eliminated, leading to his recovery. The pathways of the kidneys&#39; Shaoyin channel connect to the root of the tongue; the pathways of the spleen’s Taiyin channel also link to the root of the tongue; while the heart’s hand Shaoyin branch is associated with the tongue&#39;s base. Thus, when these three channels are deficient, phlegm takes advantage of this void, blocking their pathways, which results in the tongue&#39;s inability to articulate speech. If any of these three channels lack blood, the tongue will be devoid of blood nourishment and hence become mute. It is recorded that needling the foot&#39;s Shaoyin channel can lead to significant blood loss, making speech difficult. Furthermore, it is noted that overstimulation of the sublingual channel may cause excessive bleeding, resulting in muteness. Treatments should thus involve adding blood-nourishing herbs to the original prescription.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>A man in his fifties, who had a strong affinity for alcohol, began to cough up blood and later ceased to eat. His tongue could not speak, but he was thirsty for water. His pulse was slightly rapid. He was treated with one tael each of Gui Zhi, Chuan Xiong, Bai Shao, and Di Huang; two taels each of Fu Ling and Ren Shen; one and a half taels of Chen Pi; and two qian of Gan Cao, combined with bamboo juice, children&#39;s urine, and ginger juice. After more than twenty applications, he could speak again. </p>
<p>In cases where the three pulses indicated wind-heat, the pulse was slack and relaxed, hence the tongue was also slack and unable to articulate, leading to muteness. If wind-cold was present, the pulse became tight and swift, causing the tongue to become strong and curled, which also resulted in muteness.</p>
<p>Another man suffering from a long-term phlegm cough suddenly caught a wind-cold after consuming food and alcohol. This led to a fit of qi blockage in the throat and an abrupt onset of muteness. Moxibustion was applied at Feng Long (Gallbladder 36) two points, three cones each, and at Zhao Hai (Kidney 6) two points, one cone each, which restored his voice immediately. </p>
<p>Moreover, Huang Qin was used to clear heat as the primary medicine, with Xing Ren, Chen Pi, and Jie Geng used to expel the qi blockage as the secondary ingredients. He Zi was added to help eliminate adverse qi, while Gan Cao aided in harmonizing the vital energy as an assistant. Taking this combination resulted in a good recovery.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　总论证治</p>
<p>　　声音者，内关五脏，其为病也，因于六气。金匮真言论曰：东方青色，入通于肝，其音角，其声呼。南方赤色，入通于心，其音征，其声笑。中央黄色，入通于脾，其音宫，其声歌。西方白色，入通于肺，其音商，其声哭。北方黑色，入通于肾，其音羽，其声呻。此所以声音通于五脏者也。《直指》云：心为声音之主，肺为声音之门，肾为声音之根，此特言其所重者。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>舌为心之苗，心病舌不能转，则不能语言，暴病者尚可医治，久病者不可治也，故心为声音之主者此也。肺者属金，主清肃，外司皮腠，风寒外感者，热郁于内，则肺金不清，咳嗽而声哑，故肺为声音之门者此也。肾者人身之根本，元气发生之主也，肾气一亏，则元气寖弱而语音喑者有之。经曰：言而微，终日乃复言者，此夺气也。钱氏方：小儿吐泻利，小便过多，以致脾虚不饮食，用益黄散作效。数日后，忽尔不语，钱氏知其脾气已复，肾气尚虚，投以地黄丸益肾，相继数剂，遂能言，于是益信声音之根出于肾也不诬。<br>　　　　　病分三因</p>
<p>　　有内热痰郁窒塞肺金，而声哑及不出者，及有咳嗽久远，伤气而散者，此内因也。有外受风寒，腠理闭塞，寒束于外，郁嗽而声哑，三拗汤之类，此外因也；又有忽暴吸风，卒然声不出者，亦外因也。有因争竞，大声号叫，以致失声，或因歌唱伤气而声不出，此不内外因也，养息自愈。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>　　　　　证本六淫</p>
<p>　　风寒燥热，致声不清者，人共知之，暑湿相干者，鲜有知也。经曰：因于湿，首如裹。声如从室中言，此中气之湿也。《直指》云：风寒暑湿燥火痰气有干于心肺者，病在上脘，随证解之，邪气散则天籁鸣矣。惟夫肾虚为病，不能纳诸气以归元，故气奔而上，咳嗽痰壅，或喘或胀，足冷骨痿，胸腹百骸俱为之牵掣，其嗽愈重，其气愈乏，其声愈干，君子当于受病之处图之可也。　　风寒咳嗽失音者，三拗汤主之。热痰壅盛声不出者，盐汤探吐之。大腑秘结，上下不通，声气不出者，大柴胡汤下之。此皆切于病证，其效如向应也。　　凡病人久嗽声哑，乃是元气不足，肺气不滋，宜补气养金润燥，其声自亮。若虚劳之人，则宜滋肾水润肺金为本，诃子百药煎收敛以治其标。标本兼治，此十全也。久病人不语，为心气绝者死。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>　　　　古今医鉴 【明　龚信】</p>

<p>　　声音出于脏气。凡脏实则声宏，脏虚则声怯。故凡五脏之病，皆能为喑。如以忧思积虑久而至喑者，心之病也；惊恐愤郁猝然致喑者，肝之病也；或以风寒袭于皮毛，火燥刑于金脏，为咳为嗽而致喑者，肺之病也；或以饥饱，或以疲劳，致败中气而喘促为喑者，脾之病也；至于酒色过伤，欲火燔烁，以致阴亏而盗气于阳，精竭而移槁于肺，肺燥而嗽，嗽久而喑者，此肾水枯涸之病也。是五脏皆能为喑者，其概如此。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>然舌为心之苗，心病则舌不能转，此心为声音之主也。声由气而发，肺病则气夺，此气为声音之户也。肾藏精，精化气，阴虚则无气，此肾为声音之根也。经曰：言而微，终日乃复言者，此气之夺也，而况于无声者乎？是知声音之病，虽由五脏，而实惟心之神、肺之气、肾之精，三者为之主耳。然人以肾为根蒂，元气之所由生也，故由精化气，由气化神。使肾气一亏，则元阳寖弱，所以声音之标在心肺，而声音之本则在肾。观之经云：阳盛已衰，故为喑也。内夺而厥，则为喑俳。此肾虚也。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>然则肾为声音之根，信非谬矣。　　喑哑之病，当知虚实，实者其病在标，因窍闭而喑也。虚者其病在本，因内夺而喑也。窍闭者，有风寒之闭，外感证也。有火邪之闭，热乘肺也。有气逆之闭，肝滞强也。风闭者，可散而愈；火闭者，可清而愈；气闭者，可顺而愈。此皆实邪之易治者也。至若痰涎之闭，虽曰有虚有实，然非治节不行，何致痰邪若此？此其虚者多而实者少，当察邪正分缓急而治之可也。<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>内夺者，有色欲之夺，伤其肾也；忧思之夺，伤其心也；大惊大恐之夺，伤其胆也；饥馁疲劳之夺，伤其脾也。此非各求其属，而大补元气，安望其嘶败者复完，而残损者复振乎？此皆虚邪之难治者也。然难易之辨固若此，而犹有难易之辨者，则辨其久暂，辨其病因，乃可悉焉。盖暂而近者易，渐而久者难；脉缓而滑者易，脉细而数者难；素无损伤者易，积有劳怯者难；数剂即开者易，久药罔效者难。此外复有号叫歌唱悲哭，及因热极暴饮冷水，或暴吸风寒而致喑者，乃又其易者也。若此者但知养息，则弗药可愈。是皆所当辨者。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>　　　　　论治</p>

<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Subtlety of Pulses</strong></p>
<p>If the pulse of the heart is strong and long, the person will experience a rolled tongue and be unable to speak.<br><em>[Note: A strong and long pulse indicates excessive pulsation, which results from excessive heart fire. Since the heart governs speech, this leads to an inability to speak.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Five Evils</strong></p>
<p>If one is disturbed by the Five Evils, an obstruction to the yin causes silence.<br><em>[Note: The Foot Shaoyin is connected to the tongue, linked to the horizontal bone, and ultimately reaches the epiglottis. When the evil obstructs the yin, the epiglottis cannot move, leading to an inability to vocalize, thus resulting in silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On Rare Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: If a person is burdened and remains silent for nine months, what is the reason for this? Qibo answered: The meridian of the womb is severed. The womb&#39;s meridian is connected to the kidneys, the pulse of the Shaoyin passes through the kidneys and connects to the root of the tongue, which is why they cannot speak. The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qibo replied: There is no treatment; they will recover after ten months.<br><em>[Note: After ten months, when the fetus is delivered, the womb&#39;s meridian will be restored and the voice will return.]</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Great Oddities</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse does not arrive, it is like being mute; without treatment, it will resolve itself.<br>[Note: When the pulse is blocked, sound cannot be produced. When the pulse is unblocked, sound naturally recovers. Therefore, when the pulse does not arrive and one is mute, there is no need for treatment, as the illness will resolve on its own. This is related to the blockage of the meridians and differs from being mute due to external factors.]</p>
<p>The stomach pulse is deep, beating strongly but unevenly, while the heart pulse is small, firm, and urgent, indicating a deficiency in the liver. Men show signs on the left, women on the right. If one is mute but can turn the tongue, treatment is possible, starting after thirty days. If the follower is mute, it begins after three years. Those under twenty years of age tend to die within three years.<br>[Note: In the yangming channel, both qi and blood are abundant, so the pulse should be floating and large. Now, if the pulse is deep and beating unevenly, this indicates a deficiency of blood and qi within. If the pulse is large, it signifies a deficiency of blood and qi externally. Qi from the nourishment and defense must flow from the inner organs to the physical body; if it is insufficient, the qi in the channels becomes deficient, resulting in numbness and paralysis between the chest, ribs, and back. &quot;Liver&quot; here signifies deficiency. Although qi and blood from nourishment and defense arise in yangming and are governed by the heart, their origin is in the kidneys, which are pre-natal. The lesser yin meridians connect to the origin of qi at the root of the tongue; if the tongue can turn and is not mute, the primordial qi remains uninjured, thus treatment is possible. The distinctions of men showing signs on the left and women on the right indicate that while the blood and qi of yin and yang are balanced, if mute, it will take three years to recover. However, if one is under twenty and shows this abnormality, their organs are robust and their blood and qi are plentiful; contrary symptoms may arise, leading to a gradual depletion of qi in the five organs and six intestines, ultimately resulting in death within three years.]<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Abdominal Disorders</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: There is illness with swelling in the throat and pain, fullness in the chest and bloating in the abdomen; what illness is this? How does one acquire it? Qibo replied: It is called &quot;counterflow.&quot; The Emperor asked: How should it be treated? Qibo said: If you use moxibustion, it leads to muteness; if you use stones, it leads to mania. It is necessary that the qi is harmonized before it can be treated. The Emperor asked: Why is this so? Qibo explained: The yang qi rises excessively above; if moxibustion is applied, the yang qi enters the yin, leading to muteness. If stones are used, the yang qi becomes depleted, and when depleted, it leads to mania. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The rising of the yang qi and the counterflow of abdominal qi towards above indicate an excess in the upper parts; thus, if moxibustion is applied, the hot yang qi enters the yin and results in muteness. If stones are used, the yang qi leaks out and becomes depleted, resulting in mania. It is essential that the counterflow qi and blood are harmonized before treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Pulses</strong></p>
<p>The so-called muteness caused by the taiyang (greater yang) means that the yang has become overly vigorous and then diminished, leading to muteness. When the internal qi is depleted and counterflown, it results in sudden muteness; this indicates kidney deficiency. If the shaoyin (lesser yin) does not reach, it leads to counterflow. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The muteness caused by internal qi being depleted indicates that the yang has become overly vigorous and then diminished; if the internal qi is insufficient, it results in yin deficiency and muteness. When yang receives qi from the extremities, if the yang becomes overly vigorous and then diminishes, the limbs fail to retract, resulting in sudden onset. Kidney qi insufficiency leads to muteness due to lack of shaoyin qi, causing coldness in the hands and feet.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Qi Transformation</strong></p>
<p>When the yearly fire energy is insufficient, cold prevails greatly, and the people suffer from sudden muteness.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The coldness of water affects the heart, which governs speech; therefore, it leads to sudden muteness.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<h3>The Spirit Pivot Classic</h3>
<h4>On the Forms of Disease in the Organs from Evil Qi</h4>
<p>If the heart&#39;s pulse is blocked, it results in significant silence. </p>
<h4>On the Meridians</h4>
<p>The branch of the Hand Shao Yin, named Tong Li, runs through the meridian into the heart, connects to the root of the tongue, and is associated with the eye. In its essence, it influences the diaphragm; if it is empty, it cannot articulate. </p>
<p>The branch of the Foot Yang Ming, called Feng Long, runs along the outer edge of the tibia, ascends to connect with the head and neck, and links to the energies of various meridians, descending to connect with the throat. If the evil energy reverses, it leads to throat obstruction and sudden silence. </p>
<p>The branch of Yang Ming connects with the meridian at Feng Long and diverges to the branch of the Foot Tai Yin. This branch travels along the outer edge of the tibia and ascends to the head and neck. All the vital energies and blood of the fifteen major branches originate from what is generated in the stomach and intestines from food and drink. Therefore, the branch of the Foot Yang Ming should connect with the energies of all meridians; when the silent energy reverses, it causes throat obstruction, relating to the branch of the meridian in the throat.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Treatise on Sudden Anxiety and Anger</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked the Master of the Lesser Knowledge: &quot;When a person suddenly feels anxiety and anger but has no voice, what causes this blockage? What obstructs the energy, preventing sound from manifesting? I wish to know the remedy.&quot; The Master of the Lesser Knowledge replied: &quot;The throat is the passage for food and water. The throat is where qi moves up and down. The epiglottis is the doorway for sound. The lips and teeth are the fan for sound. The tongue is the instrument for sound. The uvula is the gate of sound. The nostrils are where the qi escapes. The horizontal bone governs the spirit’s qi and directs the tongue. Therefore, when the nasal passages discharge and are uncontained, the nostrils are not open, and the flow of qi is lost. Thus, when the epiglottis is small and thin, qi escapes quickly, and the opening and closing are beneficial, making the exhalation easy; when the epiglottis is large and thick, the opening and closing are difficult, and the exhalation is slow, leading to heavy speech. When a person suddenly has no voice, it is because cold qi invades the epiglottis, preventing it from functioning, so sound cannot be produced or descend, resulting in a lack of voice.&quot; </p>
<p><em>Note: The lungs govern sound, the heart governs speech, the liver governs language; yet this is expressed through the qi from the lesser yin kidney.</em><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, the wise ruler assesses those who have sound but unclear speech and should hold their heart and liver accountable; those who can speak but produce no sound should be held responsible for their spleen and lungs; those who cannot speak and have no sound suffer from a reversal of kidney energy. Worry harms the lungs; when the lungs are harmed, there will be no sound. Anger injures the liver; when the liver is hurt, speech becomes unclear. This is the gateway of sound, referring to the expression of vibrational energy coming forth. When the lips open and close, only then are speech and clarity achieved, thus operating as the fan of sound. When the tongue moves, speech can be produced, functioning as the mechanism of sound. The hanging soft palate is the barrier for sound. The nasal cavity connects the airflow of the mouth and nose, facilitating the release of breath, so this is where the energy is divided and emitted through the mouth and nose. The horizontal bone allows spirit and energy to flow in and out, thus controlling the articulation of speech. If the nose cannot expel mucus, it is because the soft palate is not open, leading to a loss of breath division. The epiglottis serves to open and close and mediates the passage of sound and energy. If it is thin, sound is produced quickly; if it is thick, the opening and closing are difficult, delaying the exit of energy, resulting in heavy speech. The presence of cold energy corresponds to the cold water energy of the lesser yin. The channel of the lesser yin is connected to the tongue, linked to the horizontal bone, reaching the epiglottis. When the vital energy rises, sound can be emitted. If cold energy affects the epiglottis, it cannot open; if it cannot open, it cannot close. Thus, if the mechanisms of opening and closing fail, there will be no sound.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>The heart is the master of sound, the lungs are the gate of sound, and the kidneys are the root of sound. Factors like wind, cold, heat, damp, and phlegm-heat, as well as pathogenic influences affecting the heart and lungs, can lead to illness in the upper body; treat according to the symptoms, and as the pathogenic influences disperse, the natural sounds will emerge again. However, if the illness arises from kidney deficiency, it can’t properly absorb the qi to return to the source, thus causing qi to rebel upwards, leading to coughs and clogs, which negatively impact the chest, abdomen, and entire body. This results in increasing severity of the cough, decreasing strength of the qi, and dryness of the voice.<br>— From &quot;Discussion on Guiding Misdirection&quot; by Qian Yi, Song Dynasty</p>
<p>The symptoms of kidney deficiency are similar to loss of voice. After vomiting, diarrhea, or major illnesses, even if there is sound, the person cannot speak, and if they do not take medicine, this is not a true loss of voice, but rather due to kidney deficiency failing to connect with the Yang. Hence, kidney tonification is necessary, primarily with Di Huang Wan. True loss of voice is simply due to sudden onset from wind-cold.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Six Writings of Hejian by Jin Liu Wanshu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unable to Speak</strong></p>
<p>When the kidneys are deficient and internal energy is exhausted, one becomes mute. It is due to the lack of internal energy causing syncope; the tongue is mute and unable to speak, the legs are incapacitated and not functional. The kidneys&#39; channels are weak, causing a lack of vital energy, and hence the tongue becomes insensitive. The scriptures state that when one is mute and the feet are unresponsive, the remedy is the Rehmannia Decoction. If one experiences dryness, it is because metal (lungs) is the root of this condition; dry metal heated transforms into dryness and exhaustion. In conjunction with heat, it leads to the impairment of metal, depleting fluids and damaging blood, becoming stagnant and resulting in dryness. This occurs because wind can overcome damp heat which consumes fluids; thus, the scriptures say that wind, heat, and fire are all yang, while cold, dampness, and dryness belong to yin. Furthermore, dry and damp are slightly different; although metal and dryness belong to autumn yin, their nature differs from cold and damp, aligning instead with wind, heat, and fire. Additionally, when the stool is dry and hard, it indicates the large intestine has been heated, turning it dry and firm. The scripture mentions various states of dryness and hardening. Similarly, paralysis and strokes occur due to heat consuming blood, leading to blockage and an inability to moisten. The metal suffers from heat stagnation, causing inability to produce sound, as the lungs govern voice. Pain and weakness in limbs result from the clash of wind, heat, and damp, resulting in unilateral atrophy, muddled speech, and limbs not following. Coldness in the center, vomiting, and diarrhea lead to loss of fluids and dryness, which is also noteworthy. There can also be oppression from cold and dampness that obstructs the nourishing and protective systems, leading to increased atrophy. The scriptures state: &quot;All that is dry, hard, and withered belongs to dryness.&quot;<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sudden Loss of Voice</strong></p>
<p>Sudden loss of voice refers to a sudden muteness. The lungs, associated with metal, govern sound; thus, in the five elements, only metal can resonate. Metal corresponds to the heavens, which are yang, vigorous, and dynamic; metal is inherently dry, reclusive, and contained, strong and pure, so those who can produce sound do not exceed this principle. All vocal sounds arise from the impact of one’s physical energy. Such impact is the application of vigor and movement. As for things that can produce sound when cold, water indeed restrains fire; fire cannot overcome metal. If fire is strong and water weak, and heat overwhelms the lung metal, resulting in muddied spirit and stagnant energy, then sudden muteness occurs. It is stated in the classics: when internal withdrawal occurs, it leads to muteness, which is related to kidney deficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding Women’s Heaviness</strong></p>
<p>When women are nine months pregnant, if they are mute and cannot speak, it indicates that the channels of the bladder are not connected, preventing them from speaking. The texts say: it is not treatable. However, despite this perspective, one can prepare two taels of jade candle decoction, boil it with one bowl of water until reduced to seven parts, strain, allow to cool, and add a little honey to sip occasionally. This will lower the heart fire and clear the lung metal, thus enabling speech.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

Therefore, when these three channels are deficient, phlegm and saliva take advantage of the deficiency, blocking their pathways, causing the tongue to be unable to articulate speech. If these three channels lack blood, the tongue is without the nourishing blood, hence treatment should focus on replenishing blood. Furthermore, if the three channels are disturbed by wind-heat, the tongue&#39;s channel becomes relaxed; if affected by wind-cold, the tongue&#39;s channel becomes tense and urgent.

<p>For those who are mute, it is due to malevolent influences entering the yin areas. The text states: &quot;When malevolent influences strike the yin, it results in muteness.&quot; It also states: &quot;When malevolent influences enter the yin and create obstruction, it leads to muteness.&quot; There are two conditions: one is tongue muteness, which is related to wind stroke affecting the tongue&#39;s ability to articulate. Here the tongue itself cannot express speech, but the voice from the throat remains as before. The second is throat muteness, which is related to excessive coughing causing loss of voice. In this case, the voice becomes hoarse from the throat, while the tongue still retains its ability to articulate speech.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

<h3>Ancient and Modern Medical Principles (Ming, Xu Chunfu)</h3>
<h4>General Discussion on Diagnosis and Treatment</h4>
<p>Sound is associated with the interaction of the five internal organs and its diseases stem from the six Qi. The &quot;Jin Kui Zhen Yan&quot; states: the eastern blue corresponds to the liver, its sound is the horn, its tone is a call. The southern red corresponds to the heart, its sound is the zheng, its tone is a laugh. The central yellow corresponds to the spleen, its sound is the palace, its tone is a song. The western white corresponds to the lungs, its sound is the商, its tone is a cry. The northern black corresponds to the kidneys, its sound is the feather, its tone is a moan. This is why sounds are linked to the five internal organs. The &quot;Zhi Zhi&quot; states: the heart is the master of sound, the lung is the door to sound, and the kidney is the root of sound, which emphasizes their importance.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The tongue is the sprout of the heart; if the heart&#39;s ailment cannot be transformed by the tongue, then one cannot speak. Those suffering from acute illnesses can still be treated, but those with chronic conditions cannot be cured. Therefore, the heart is the master of sound. The lungs belong to metal, governing clarity and purification, externally controlling the skin and pores. When wind and cold attack from outside, and heat accumulates within, the lung&#39;s metal becomes unclear, leading to coughing and hoarseness. Hence, the lungs are the gateway to sound. The kidneys are the root of the body, the master of the original qi. If kidney qi is deficient, the original qi gradually weakens, leading to speechlessness. The classics state: speaking softly and then regaining the ability to speak all day signifies a loss of qi. According to the Qian family&#39;s treatment, for children who vomit, have diarrhea, and excessive urination, which leads to spleen deficiency and loss of appetite, the use of Yihuang powder is effective. After several days of treatment, if the child suddenly becomes mute, it indicates that the spleen&#39;s energy has recovered but the kidney qi remains insufficient. Administering Dihuang pills to nourish the kidneys, in several doses, will enable the child to speak again, thus confirming that the root of sound indeed springs from the kidneys.</p>
<p>The causes of illness can be divided into three:</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal: There is internal heat, phlegm obstructing the lung&#39;s metal, leading to hoarseness or loss of voice, and long-term coughing that exhausts the qi.</li>
<li>External: Exposure to wind and cold, causing closure of the pores and external cold binding, leading to cough and hoarseness; treatments like San&#39;ao Decoction belong to this external cause. Additionally, sudden exposure to wind can cause a loss of voice, which is also an external cause.</li>
<li>Mixed: Due to loud arguing or shouting, leading to loss of voice, or singing leading to qi injury, which is not strictly an internal or external cause; rest and nourishment can lead to self-healing.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></li>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Understanding the Six Pathogenic Factors</strong></p>
<p>Wind, cold, dryness, and heat, which lead to indistinct sounds—people generally recognize these. However, the influence of summer heat and dampness is less understood. The classics say: &quot;When affected by dampness, the head feels wrapped, and the voice seems as though it comes from within a room,&quot; referring to the dampness in the qi. The &quot;Direct Pointing&quot; states: Wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, fire, phlegm, and qi affecting the heart and lungs can cause disease in the upper abdomen; treat the symptoms accordingly, and once the evil qi is dispersed, the natural sounds will resonate once more. </p>
<p>However, when kidney deficiency is the root of the disease, it fails to gather the various qi back to the source, causing the qi to rush upward, resulting in coughing, phlegm obstruction, possible wheezing or bloating, cold feet, chronic weakness, and pulling sensations throughout the chest and abdomen; as the cough worsens, the qi wanes, and the voice becomes increasingly dry. A wise individual should address the site of the illness.</p>
<p>For coughs due to wind and cold leading to loss of voice, the San Yao Decoction is the remedy. For excess heat and phlegm obstructing the voice, use salt water to induce vomiting. In cases of hard stool blockage in the large intestine, causing an inability to release sounds or qi, administer the Da Chai Hu Decoction. These remedies are tailored to the individual’s symptoms, acting as effective treatments.</p>
<p>In general, if a patient has a persistent cough and a hoarse voice, it indicates a deficiency of original qi and insufficient lung qi. It is advisable to replenish qi, nourish metal, and moisten dryness, allowing the voice to recover naturally. For individuals with deficiency due to prolonged illness, it is important to nourish kidney water and moisten lung metal as a foundation, employing herbs like Haritaki in various decoctions to consolidate treatment. </p>
<p>By addressing both the root and branch of the problem, this approach is comprehensive. If a long-term patient remains mute, it signifies a total depletion of heart qi, which may lead to death.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Compendium of Materia Medica</strong> [Ming, Li Shizhen]<br><strong>Miscellaneous Symptoms</strong><br>Loss of voice can occur due to lung heat, pulmonary atrophy, or the invasion of wind toxins into the lungs, as well as from parasitic infections in the lungs; it may be caused by cold combined with heat, or by demonic possession; or it may manifest as loss of voice and inability to speak, with a strong tongue yet silent; or it could be due to phlegm obstruction; or from kidney deficiency causing mutism.  </p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Treatise</strong> [Ming, Zhang Jieben]<br><strong>Discussion on Symptoms</strong><br>Voice originates from the Qi of the viscera. When the viscera are in excess, the voice is loud; when they are deficient, the voice is weak. Therefore, diseases of any of the five viscera can lead to mutism. For instance, prolonged worry and anxiety leading to mutism is a heart condition; sudden mutism caused by shock, fear, or anger is a liver condition; or when wind and cold affect the skin and fire disturbs the lungs, leading to coughing and eventually mutism, it is a lung condition; when mutism arises from hunger or fatigue, causing a failure of the middle Qi, it is a spleen condition; as for excessive indulgence in alcohol and lust, burning the yin and stealing Qi from the yang, leading to exhaustion and dehydration of the lung, dryness, and prolonged coughing resulting in mutism, this is due to the kidney&#39;s water being dried up. Thus, all five viscera can cause mutism, and this summarizes their potential causes.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The tongue is the seed of the heart; when the heart is ill, the tongue cannot articulate. The heart is the master of sound. Sound emerges from qi; when the lungs are sick, qi is depleted. Thus, qi is the gateway of sound. The kidneys store essence; essence transforms into qi. When yin is deficient, there is no qi; thus, the kidneys are the root of sound. </p>
<p>The Classics say: &quot;When speech is subtle, and one speaks again only after a whole day, this is a depletion of qi; how much more so for one who is silent?&quot; It is understood that ailments of sound arise from the five organs, but they fundamentally depend on the spirit of the heart, the qi of the lungs, and the essence of the kidneys—these three are its masters.</p>
<p>However, the kidneys are considered the foundational root, the source from which original qi is born. Hence, essence transforms into qi, and qi transforms into spirit. If kidney qi is depleted, the original yang gradually weakens. Therefore, while the external manifestations of sound are in the heart and lungs, its essence lies in the kidneys. The Classics state: &quot;When yang is strong yet begins to decline, it leads to muteness.&quot; If there is internal depletion leading to collapse, it results in muteness, indicating kidney deficiency.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Indeed, the kidneys are the root of sound, and this is no mistake. In cases of muteness, one must understand the distinction between deficiency and excess. For excess, the illness is in the manifestation; it is caused by closed orifices, leading to muteness. For deficiency, the illness is rooted; it is caused by internal deprivation, leading to muteness. </p>
<p>When the orifices are closed, it can be due to wind and cold obstructing, which is an external condition. It can also be due to fire pathogens obstructing, which leads to heat affecting the lungs. It can be due to reversed qi, leading to liver stagnation. When it is due to wind obstruction, it can be dispersed and resolved; when it is due to fire obstruction, it can be cleared and resolved; when it is due to qi obstruction, it can be regulated and resolved. These are all conditions of excessive pathogens that are relatively easy to treat.</p>
<p>As for the obstruction caused by phlegm and fluids, although it may be said to be both deficient and excessive, without treatment to regulate, how could phlegm-heat become so severe? It is more often the case that there is more deficiency than excess, and one must discern the nature of the pathogens and the urgency of treatment.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who are internally deprived experience various forms of loss: the loss due to lust damages the kidneys; the loss due to worry and contemplation injures the heart; the loss due to great fright harms the gallbladder; and the loss from hunger, malnutrition, and fatigue affects the spleen. These are not individual pursuits, but rather a major supplement to vital energy. Can one expect the broken to return to completeness or the damaged to regain vitality? These are all difficult issues caused by emptiness and evil. </p>
<p>However, while distinguishing between difficulty and ease is essential, there is also a necessity to distinguish between duration and temporality, as well as the underlying causes of illnesses. This clarity is vital. Things that are temporary and near are easier to treat, while those that are gradual and prolonged are more difficult. A pulse that is slow and slippery is easier to handle, while a thin and rapid pulse is more challenging. Conditions that have not sustained injury are easier to treat, but those burdened with accumulated fatigue are harder. Immediate results from a few doses are easier, while a long-term medication with no effect is much more difficult.</p>
<p>Additionally, responses such as crying, singing, or lamenting, or situations involving extreme heat followed by consuming cold water, or sudden exposure to cold wind leading to hoarseness, fall under the category of easier cases. In these instances, simply knowing to nurture and rest can lead to recovery without the need for medication.

<p>If fire pathogens invade the lungs, causing excessive heat in the upper burner and leading to hoarseness, one should use Si Yin Decoction or Mai Men Dong Decoction. For excessive heart fire, Er Yin Decoction is appropriate. If there is stomach fire rising, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction. For excessive liver and gallbladder fire, remedies like Chai Hu Qing Gan Decoction should be used. </p>
<p>In cases of fatigue-related sputum cough accompanied by fire, Bamboo Leaf and Mai Men Dong Decoction is suitable. If liver pathogens cause reversed qi leading to hoarseness, one should use Xiao Jiang Qi Decoction, Run Xia Pill, or Qi Decoction. </p>
<p>For sputum qi stagnation leading to hoarseness, remedies like Er Chen Decoction, Liu An Decoction, Bei Mu Pill, or Run Xia Pill can be used to treat the symptoms. One may also use salty decoction to induce vomiting. If there is excessive weak phlegm or phlegm fire, treatment should be considered according to the principles of phlegm and drink. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The disease of prickly heat presents with no pain in the body, the limbs do not contract, the mind is in disorder, and speech is faint, indicating that it can be treated. In severe cases, the patient cannot speak, signifying that it is untreatable. The illness first arises from Yang and subsequently enters Yin; thus, one should first address the Yang and then the Yin, taking from the surface.</p>
<p>The spleen corresponds to the channel of the Greater Yin. When one is active, the tongue at its root becomes strong. If pronounced, it should be drained; if deficient, it should be supplemented; if hot, it should be treated urgently; if cold, it should be retained; and if it sinks, it should be moxibusted.</p>
<p>The hand&#39;s Lesser Yin channel is called Tongli, located 1.5 inches above the wrist. It branches upwards into the heart and connects to the root of the tongue; if deficient, speech becomes impaired, and one should take from one inch behind the palm.</p>
<p>The foot&#39;s Yangming channel is called Fenglong, located 8 inches above the ankle. It branches to the Greater Yin, connecting to the throat. If there is adverse Qi, it leads to throat obstruction and sudden muteness, and one should take from its branch.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked the Lesser Teacher, &quot;What causes sudden worry or anger leading to speechlessness?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states: If a person&#39;s tongue is short, their speech is unclear, which indicates that phlegm and saliva are blocking the channels at the root of the tongue. I once treated a middle-aged man with a febrile illness, who was given five doses of herbs for febrile conditions. Afterward, he fell into a state of confusion and became mute. I diagnosed it as a case of deficiency with phlegm. I prescribed five qian of ginseng, one qian each of astragalus, white atractylodes, angelica, and aged tangerine peel, boiled in a decoction, mixed with bamboo sap and ginger juice for him to drink. After twelve days, he could utter one word; after another half month of taking the remedy, his ability to articulate gradually improved, and his heat was eliminated, leading to his recovery. The pathways of the kidneys&#39; Shaoyin channel connect to the root of the tongue; the pathways of the spleen’s Taiyin channel also link to the root of the tongue; while the heart’s hand Shaoyin branch is associated with the tongue&#39;s base. Thus, when these three channels are deficient, phlegm takes advantage of this void, blocking their pathways, which results in the tongue&#39;s inability to articulate speech. If any of these three channels lack blood, the tongue will be devoid of blood nourishment and hence become mute. It is recorded that needling the foot&#39;s Shaoyin channel can lead to significant blood loss, making speech difficult. Furthermore, it is noted that overstimulation of the sublingual channel may cause excessive bleeding, resulting in muteness. Treatments should thus involve adding blood-nourishing herbs to the original prescription.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

<p>In cases where the three pulses indicated wind-heat, the pulse was slack and relaxed, hence the tongue was also slack and unable to articulate, leading to muteness.

<p>Another man suffering from a long-term phlegm cough suddenly caught a wind-cold after consuming food and alcohol. This led to a fit of qi blockage in the throat and an abrupt onset of muteness.

Now, if the pulse is deep and beating unevenly, this indicates a deficiency of blood and qi within. If the pulse is large, it signifies a deficiency of blood and qi externally. Qi from the nourishment and defense must flow from the inner organs to the physical body; if it is insufficient, the qi in the channels becomes deficient, resulting in numbness and paralysis between the chest, ribs, and back. \"Liver\" here signifies deficiency. Although qi and blood from nourishment and defense arise in yangming and are governed by the heart, their origin is in the kidneys, which are pre-natal. The lesser yin meridians connect to the origin of qi at the root of the tongue; if the tongue can turn and is not mute, the primordial qi remains uninjured, thus treatment is possible. The distinctions of men showing signs on the left and women on the right indicate that while the blood and qi of yin and yang are balanced, if mute, it will take three years to recover.

Qibo said: If you use moxibustion, it leads to muteness; if you use stones, it leads to mania. It is necessary that the qi is harmonized before it can be treated. The Emperor asked: Why is this so? Qibo explained: The yang qi rises excessively above; if moxibustion is applied, the yang qi enters the yin, leading to muteness. If stones are used, the yang qi becomes depleted, and when depleted, it leads to mania. **Notes**: The rising of the yang qi and the counterflow of abdominal qi towards above indicate an excess in the upper parts; thus, if moxibustion is applied, the hot yang qi enters the yin and results in muteness. If stones are used, the yang qi leaks out and becomes depleted, resulting in mania. It is essential that the counterflow qi and blood are harmonized before treatment. **Discussion on Pulses** The so-called muteness caused by the taiyang (greater yang) means that the yang has become overly vigorous and then diminished, leading to muteness. When the internal qi is depleted and counterflown, it results in sudden muteness; this indicates kidney deficiency. If the shaoyin (lesser yin) does not reach, it leads to counterflow. **Notes**: The muteness caused by internal qi being depleted indicates that the yang has become overly vigorous and then diminished; if the internal qi is insufficient, it results in yin deficiency and muteness. When yang receives qi from the extremities, if the yang becomes overly vigorous and then diminishes, the limbs fail to retract, resulting in sudden onset. Kidney qi insufficiency leads to muteness due to lack of shaoyin qi, causing coldness in the hands and feet. **Discussion on Qi Transformation** When the yearly fire energy is insufficient, cold prevails greatly, and the people suffer from sudden muteness. **Notes**: The coldness of water affects the heart, which governs speech; therefore, it leads to sudden muteness."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"### A Discourse on the Ultimate Truth The Emperor asked: How does the revival of the six energies manifest?

The throat is where qi moves up and down. The epiglottis is the doorway for sound. The lips and teeth are the fan for sound. The tongue is the instrument for sound. The uvula is the gate of sound. The nostrils are where the qi escapes. The horizontal bone governs the spirit’s qi and directs the tongue. Therefore, when the nasal passages discharge and are uncontained, the nostrils are not open, and the flow of qi is lost. Thus, when the epiglottis is small and thin, qi escapes quickly, and the opening and closing are beneficial, making the exhalation easy; when the epiglottis is large and thick, the opening and closing are difficult, and the exhalation is slow, leading to heavy speech. When a person suddenly has no voice, it is because cold qi invades the epiglottis, preventing it from functioning, so sound cannot be produced or descend, resulting in a lack of voice.\" *Note: The lungs govern sound, the heart governs speech, the liver governs language; yet this is expressed through the qi from the lesser yin kidney.*"},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"Therefore, the wise ruler assesses those who have sound but unclear speech and should hold their heart and liver accountable; those who can speak but produce no sound should be held responsible for their spleen and lungs; those who cannot speak and have no sound suffer from a reversal of kidney energy. Worry harms the lungs; when the lungs are harmed, there will be no sound. Anger injures the liver; when the liver is hurt, speech becomes unclear. This is the gateway of sound, referring to the expression of vibrational energy coming forth. When the lips open and close, only then are speech and clarity achieved, thus operating as the fan of sound. When the tongue moves, speech can be produced, functioning as the mechanism of sound. The hanging soft palate is the barrier for sound. The nasal cavity connects the airflow of the mouth and nose, facilitating the release of breath, so this is where the energy is divided and emitted through the mouth and nose. The horizontal bone allows spirit and energy to flow in and out, thus controlling the articulation of speech. If the nose cannot expel mucus, it is because the soft palate is not open, leading to a loss of breath division. The epiglottis serves to open and close and mediates the passage of sound and energy. If it is thin, sound is produced quickly; if it is thick, the opening and closing are difficult, delaying the exit of energy, resulting in heavy speech. The presence of cold energy corresponds to the cold water energy of the lesser yin. The channel of the lesser yin is connected to the tongue, linked to the horizontal bone, reaching the epiglottis. When the vital energy rises, sound can be emitted. If cold energy affects the epiglottis, it cannot open; if it cannot open, it cannot close.

It is advisable to use medicinals like Mitoseng San, Yuanzhi Wan, and Fushen San. The heart is the master of sound, the lungs are the gate of sound, and the kidneys are the root of sound.

This results in increasing severity of the cough, decreasing strength of the qi, and dryness of the voice. — From \"Discussion on Guiding Misdirection\" by Qian Yi, Song Dynasty The symptoms of kidney deficiency are similar to loss of voice. After vomiting, diarrhea, or major illnesses, even if there is sound, the person cannot speak, and if they do not take medicine, this is not a true loss of voice, but rather due to kidney deficiency failing to connect with the Yang.

It is due to the lack of internal energy causing syncope; the tongue is mute and unable to speak, the legs are incapacitated and not functional. The kidneys' channels are weak, causing a lack of vital energy, and hence the tongue becomes insensitive. The scriptures state that when one is mute and the feet are unresponsive, the remedy is the Rehmannia Decoction. If one experiences dryness, it is because metal (lungs) is the root of this condition; dry metal heated transforms into dryness and exhaustion. In conjunction with heat, it leads to the impairment of metal, depleting fluids and damaging blood, becoming stagnant and resulting in dryness. This occurs because wind can overcome damp heat which consumes fluids; thus, the scriptures say that wind, heat, and fire are all yang, while cold, dampness, and dryness belong to yin. Furthermore, dry and damp are slightly different; although metal and dryness belong to autumn yin, their nature differs from cold and damp, aligning instead with wind, heat, and fire. Additionally, when the stool is dry and hard, it indicates the large intestine has been heated, turning it dry and firm. The scripture mentions various states of dryness and hardening. Similarly, paralysis and strokes occur due to heat consuming blood, leading to blockage and an inability to moisten. The metal suffers from heat stagnation, causing inability to produce sound, as the lungs govern voice. Pain and weakness in limbs result from the clash of wind, heat, and damp, resulting in unilateral atrophy, muddled speech, and limbs not following. Coldness in the center, vomiting, and diarrhea lead to loss of fluids and dryness, which is also noteworthy. There can also be oppression from cold and dampness that obstructs the nourishing and protective systems, leading to increased atrophy. The scriptures state: \"All that is dry, hard, and withered belongs to dryness.\""},{"anchor":"trans-10p","marker":"10p","type":"translation","text":"**Sudden Loss of Voice** Sudden loss of voice refers to a sudden muteness. The lungs, associated with metal, govern sound; thus, in the five elements, only metal can resonate. Metal corresponds to the heavens, which are yang, vigorous, and dynamic; metal is inherently dry, reclusive, and contained, strong and pure, so those who can produce sound do not exceed this principle. All vocal sounds arise from the impact of one’s physical energy. Such impact is the application of vigor and movement. As for things that can produce sound when cold, water indeed restrains fire; fire cannot overcome metal. If fire is strong and water weak, and heat overwhelms the lung metal, resulting in muddied spirit and stagnant energy, then sudden muteness occurs. It is stated in the classics: when internal withdrawal occurs, it leads to muteness, which is related to kidney deficiency. **Regarding Women’s Heaviness** When women are nine months pregnant, if they are mute and cannot speak, it indicates that the channels of the bladder are not connected, preventing them from speaking.

However, despite this perspective, one can prepare two taels of jade candle decoction, boil it with one bowl of water until reduced to seven parts, strain, allow to cool, and add a little honey to sip occasionally.

Therefore, when these three channels are deficient, phlegm and saliva take advantage of the deficiency, blocking their pathways, causing the tongue to be unable to articulate speech. If these three channels lack blood, the tongue is without the nourishing blood, hence treatment should focus on replenishing blood. Furthermore, if the three channels are disturbed by wind-heat, the tongue's channel becomes relaxed; if affected by wind-cold, the tongue's channel becomes tense and urgent. Treatment should be adjusted according to the symptoms. **Classic Prescriptions of Physicians (Yuan - Wei Yilin)** **Deficiency and Diminishment** When there is exhaustion and pallor, with insufficient qi and blood, resulting in a loss of voice and prolonged muteness, it is advisable to take Tianzhen Pills. After taking them for half a month, speech will naturally return. **Medical Outline (Ming - Lou Ying)** **Two Causes of Illness** For those who are mute, it is due to malevolent influences entering the yin areas. The text states: \"When malevolent influences strike the yin, it results in muteness.\" It also states: \"When malevolent influences enter the yin and create obstruction, it leads to muteness.\" There are two conditions: one is tongue muteness, which is related to wind stroke affecting the tongue's ability to articulate. Here the tongue itself cannot express speech, but the voice from the throat remains as before. The second is throat muteness, which is related to excessive coughing causing loss of voice. In this case, the voice becomes hoarse from the throat, while the tongue still retains its ability to articulate speech."},{"anchor":"trans-12p","marker":"12p","type":"translation","text":"### Introduction to Medicine (Ming, Li Chan) #### Diagnosis and Treatment For those with deficiency of Qi and blood, or kidney deficiency, and elderly patients suddenly unable to speak, it is advisable to use Shi Quan Da Bu Tang by removing the cinnamon and adding Acorus calamus and Polygala.

The \"Jin Kui Zhen Yan\" states: the eastern blue corresponds to the liver, its sound is the horn, its tone is a call. The southern red corresponds to the heart, its sound is the zheng, its tone is a laugh. The central yellow corresponds to the spleen, its sound is the palace, its tone is a song. The western white corresponds to the lungs, its sound is the商, its tone is a cry. The northern black corresponds to the kidneys, its sound is the feather, its tone is a moan. This is why sounds are linked to the five internal organs. The \"Zhi Zhi\" states: the heart is the master of sound, the lung is the door to sound, and the kidney is the root of sound, which emphasizes their importance."},{"anchor":"trans-13p","marker":"13p","type":"translation","text":"The tongue is the sprout of the heart; if the heart's ailment cannot be transformed by the tongue, then one cannot speak. Those suffering from acute illnesses can still be treated, but those with chronic conditions cannot be cured. Therefore, the heart is the master of sound. The lungs belong to metal, governing clarity and purification, externally controlling the skin and pores. When wind and cold attack from outside, and heat accumulates within, the lung's metal becomes unclear, leading to coughing and hoarseness. Hence, the lungs are the gateway to sound. The kidneys are the root of the body, the master of the original qi. If kidney qi is deficient, the original qi gradually weakens, leading to speechlessness. The classics state: speaking softly and then regaining the ability to speak all day signifies a loss of qi. According to the Qian family's treatment, for children who vomit, have diarrhea, and excessive urination, which leads to spleen deficiency and loss of appetite, the use of Yihuang powder is effective. After several days of treatment, if the child suddenly becomes mute, it indicates that the spleen's energy has recovered but the kidney qi remains insufficient. Administering Dihuang pills to nourish the kidneys, in several doses, will enable the child to speak again, thus confirming that the root of sound indeed springs from the kidneys. The causes of illness can be divided into three: 1. Internal: There is internal heat, phlegm obstructing the lung's metal, leading to hoarseness or loss of voice, and long-term coughing that exhausts the qi. 2. External: Exposure to wind and cold, causing closure of the pores and external cold binding, leading to cough and hoarseness; treatments like San'ao Decoction belong to this external cause. Additionally, sudden exposure to wind can cause a loss of voice, which is also an external cause. 3. Mixed: Due to loud arguing or shouting, leading to loss of voice, or singing leading to qi injury, which is not strictly an internal or external cause; rest and nourishment can lead to self-healing."},{"anchor":"trans-14p","marker":"14p","type":"translation","text":"**Understanding the Six Pathogenic Factors** Wind, cold, dryness, and heat, which lead to indistinct sounds—people generally recognize these. However, the influence of summer heat and dampness is less understood. The classics say: \"When affected by dampness, the head feels wrapped, and the voice seems as though it comes from within a room,\" referring to the dampness in the qi. The \"Direct Pointing\" states: Wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, fire, phlegm, and qi affecting the heart and lungs can cause disease in the upper abdomen; treat the symptoms accordingly, and once the evil qi is dispersed, the natural sounds will resonate once more. However, when kidney deficiency is the root of the disease, it fails to gather the various qi back to the source, causing the qi to rush upward, resulting in coughing, phlegm obstruction, possible wheezing or bloating, cold feet, chronic weakness, and pulling sensations throughout the chest and abdomen; as the cough worsens, the qi wanes, and the voice becomes increasingly dry. A wise individual should address the site of the illness. For coughs due to wind and cold leading to loss of voice, the San Yao Decoction is the remedy. For excess heat and phlegm obstructing the voice, use salt water to induce vomiting. In cases of hard stool blockage in the large intestine, causing an inability to release sounds or qi, administer the Da Chai Hu Decoction. These remedies are tailored to the individual’s symptoms, acting as effective treatments. In general, if a patient has a persistent cough and a hoarse voice, it indicates a deficiency of original qi and insufficient lung qi. It is advisable to replenish qi, nourish metal, and moisten dryness, allowing the voice to recover naturally. For individuals with deficiency due to prolonged illness, it is important to nourish kidney water and moisten lung metal as a foundation, employing herbs like Haritaki in various decoctions to consolidate treatment. By addressing both the root and branch of the problem, this approach is comprehensive. If a long-term patient remains mute, it signifies a total depletion of heart qi, which may lead to death."},{"anchor":"trans-15p","marker":"15p","type":"translation","text":"**Ancient and Modern Medical References** (Ming, Gong Xin) **Stroke and Loss of Voice** In cases of stroke, where one maintains normal eating, sitting, and lying down but loses the ability to speak, this is commonly referred to as \"mute stroke.\" To remedy this, one can use a decoction with Wu Tou (Aconite) and add one qian (about 3 grams) of Shi Chang Pu (Acorus), or a recipe for He Zi (Terminalia chebula) to clear the voice. However, the inability to speak may have various causes: there may be a strong tongue yet unable to articulate, disorientation preventing speech, a tightly shut mouth, or a tongue that can articulate but slurred.

When the viscera are in excess, the voice is loud; when they are deficient, the voice is weak. Therefore, diseases of any of the five viscera can lead to mutism. For instance, prolonged worry and anxiety leading to mutism is a heart condition; sudden mutism caused by shock, fear, or anger is a liver condition; or when wind and cold affect the skin and fire disturbs the lungs, leading to coughing and eventually mutism, it is a lung condition; when mutism arises from hunger or fatigue, causing a failure of the middle Qi, it is a spleen condition; as for excessive indulgence in alcohol and lust, burning the yin and stealing Qi from the yang, leading to exhaustion and dehydration of the lung, dryness, and prolonged coughing resulting in mutism, this is due to the kidney's water being dried up.

The heart is the master of sound. Sound emerges from qi; when the lungs are sick, qi is depleted. Thus, qi is the gateway of sound. The kidneys store essence; essence transforms into qi. When yin is deficient, there is no qi; thus, the kidneys are the root of sound. The Classics say: \"When speech is subtle, and one speaks again only after a whole day, this is a depletion of qi; how much more so for one who is silent?\" It is understood that ailments of sound arise from the five organs, but they fundamentally depend on the spirit of the heart, the qi of the lungs, and the essence of the kidneys—these three are its masters. However, the kidneys are considered the foundational root, the source from which original qi is born. Hence, essence transforms into qi, and qi transforms into spirit. If kidney qi is depleted, the original yang gradually weakens. Therefore, while the external manifestations of sound are in the heart and lungs, its essence lies in the kidneys. The Classics state: \"When yang is strong yet begins to decline, it leads to muteness.\" If there is internal depletion leading to collapse, it results in muteness, indicating kidney deficiency."},{"anchor":"trans-18p","marker":"18p","type":"translation","text":"Indeed, the kidneys are the root of sound, and this is no mistake. In cases of muteness, one must understand the distinction between deficiency and excess. For excess, the illness is in the manifestation; it is caused by closed orifices, leading to muteness. For deficiency, the illness is rooted; it is caused by internal deprivation, leading to muteness. When the orifices are closed, it can be due to wind and cold obstructing, which is an external condition. It can also be due to fire pathogens obstructing, which leads to heat affecting the lungs. It can be due to reversed qi, leading to liver stagnation. When it is due to wind obstruction, it can be dispersed and resolved; when it is due to fire obstruction, it can be cleared and resolved; when it is due to qi obstruction, it can be regulated and resolved. These are all conditions of excessive pathogens that are relatively easy to treat. As for the obstruction caused by phlegm and fluids, although it may be said to be both deficient and excessive, without treatment to regulate, how could phlegm-heat become so severe?

These are all difficult issues caused by emptiness and evil. However, while distinguishing between difficulty and ease is essential, there is also a necessity to distinguish between duration and temporality, as well as the underlying causes of illnesses. This clarity is vital. Things that are temporary and near are easier to treat, while those that are gradual and prolonged are more difficult. A pulse that is slow and slippery is easier to handle, while a thin and rapid pulse is more challenging. Conditions that have not sustained injury are easier to treat, but those burdened with accumulated fatigue are harder. Immediate results from a few doses are easier, while a long-term medication with no effect is much more difficult. Additionally, responses such as crying, singing, or lamenting, or situations involving extreme heat followed by consuming cold water, or sudden exposure to cold wind leading to hoarseness, fall under the category of easier cases.

After drinking heavily, he lost his voice and could not speak. Sun employed the Heart-Strengthening Yam Pill combined with asarum and ligusticum to treat dampness. After ten days, his condition gradually improved, and he was completely healed after twenty days. When Cao saw the emperor, he was asked who treated him. He replied it was Sun Zhao, the physician. The emperor then inquired about Cao's ailment. The response was: The walls of the newly built house were damp, and the ground was very shady. When a person first arrives, the yin energy has not dissipated. Cao's heart energy was originally weak, and after drinking to excess, all his pores opened, allowing the dampness to enter and affect the pericardium. The pericardium being already deficient, the dampness further invaded it, which is why he could not speak.

I once treated a middle-aged man with a febrile illness, who was given five doses of herbs for febrile conditions. Afterward, he fell into a state of confusion and became mute. I diagnosed it as a case of deficiency with phlegm. I prescribed five qian of ginseng, one qian each of astragalus, white atractylodes, angelica, and aged tangerine peel, boiled in a decoction, mixed with bamboo sap and ginger juice for him to drink. After twelve days, he could utter one word; after another half month of taking the remedy, his ability to articulate gradually improved, and his heat was eliminated, leading to his recovery. The pathways of the kidneys' Shaoyin channel connect to the root of the tongue; the pathways of the spleen’s Taiyin channel also link to the root of the tongue; while the heart’s hand Shaoyin branch is associated with the tongue's base. Thus, when these three channels are deficient, phlegm takes advantage of this void, blocking their pathways, which results in the tongue's inability to articulate speech. If any of these three channels lack blood, the tongue will be devoid of blood nourishment and hence become mute. It is recorded that needling the foot's Shaoyin channel can lead to significant blood loss, making speech difficult. Furthermore, it is noted that overstimulation of the sublingual channel may cause excessive bleeding, resulting in muteness.

After more than twenty applications, he could speak again. In cases where the three pulses indicated wind-heat, the pulse was slack and relaxed, hence the tongue was also slack and unable to articulate, leading to muteness. If wind-cold was present, the pulse became tight and swift, causing the tongue to become strong and curled, which also resulted in muteness. Another man suffering from a long-term phlegm cough suddenly caught a wind-cold after consuming food and alcohol. This led to a fit of qi blockage in the throat and an abrupt onset of muteness. Moxibustion was applied at Feng Long (Gallbladder 36) two points, three cones each, and at Zhao Hai (Kidney 6) two points, one cone each, which restored his voice immediately.
