      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p>Ancient and Modern Compendium of Medical Literature, Volume 166</p>
<p>Neck Door</p>
<p>Huangdi&#39;s Canon of Medicine</p>
<p>True Words of the Golden Chamber</p>
<p>The east wind arises in spring, and diseases are in the liver, affecting the neck. Therefore, in winter one should not press the acupoints, and in spring one should not suffer from nasal bleeding; there should be no illness in the neck during spring. 【Note: The term &quot;yu&quot; refers to the channels through which the vital energy flows. When the internal organs are full, it leads to disease; when they are deficient, it causes organ disease. &quot;Anqiao&quot; refers to massage and guiding exercises, facilitating the flow of yang energy throughout the limbs. In winter, the yang energy is hidden; if one attempts to promote its outward flow, it cannot support the energies of spring and summer growth, thus leading to nasal bleeding and neck issues. In spring, when the disease is in the neck, it&#39;s due to external heat forcing its way through the channels, causing nasal bleeding that emerges from the lower neck, which constitutes illness in the neck.】<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>On the Essentials of Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When the pulse pushes down and does not rise, it indicates a headache.</p>
<p><strong>On the True Organs of Jade Mechanism</strong></p>
<p>The major bones are withered, the flesh is sunken. The chest is full of Qi, making it hard to breathe; internal pain radiates to the shoulders and neck, with a prognosis of death within one month. When the true organ&#39;s pulse is observed, I give it a timeframe.</p>
<p>The internal pain indicates lung injury, with the lung&#39;s correspondences found in the shoulders and back, hence the pain radiates there. If liver illness has transmitted to the organ it governs, then the prognosis is death within this month. The true organ’s pulse feels like pressing along the sharp edge of a knife, or like plucking the strings of a guqin. The expected date of death will be at twilight on a Geng or Xin day.</p>
<p>The major bones are withered, the flesh is sunken. The chest is full of Qi, making it hard to breathe; internal pain radiates to the shoulders and neck, accompanied by fever and the falling away of flesh, with a prognosis of death within ten days. </p>
<p>The lung is affected, hence the pain radiates to the shoulders and back; if it has affected the heart, this causes the fever. The heart governs blood, which is generated from the essence of the kidneys. When blood and Qi are abundant, there is heat in the flesh. If both the heart and kidneys are damaged, leading to declining essence and blood, this is why it is called the falling away of flesh.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The true pulse appears large and weak, like a feather on human skin, the illness transmitted to the heart, hence projected to die within ten days. The heart does not suffer from evil influences, thus the swiftness of death. The major bones are dry and emaciated, the flesh sinks down, there is fullness in the chest, pain in the abdomen, discomfort in the heart, heat in the shoulders and body, the flesh falls away, the eye sockets are sunken, the true pulse is visible, and one does not see others—the individual dies suddenly; those who do see others die when they reach a point beyond endurance.</p>
<p>The classic text states: For kidney disease, there is pain in the lower abdomen. The kidneys affect the heart, leading to discomfort in the heart. The heart affects the lungs, which influence the liver, hence the heat in the shoulders and body. The liver affects the spleen, resulting in sunken eye sockets. The true pulse exhibits sudden interruptions, like a finger striking a stone with a crisp sound. If one cannot see others, it means the essence and energy of the kidneys have been exhausted, thus death occurs suddenly. Those who see others still have residual energy; they die when they reach their limit, specifically at sunset. The kidneys are the source of life’s energy, emanating from below, thus hastening death.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>On Wind</strong>  </p>
<p>The symptoms of stomach wind include excessive sweating in the neck, aversion to wind, difficulty in consuming food and drink, blocked diaphragm, frequent abdominal fullness, abdominal distension when unprotected from the cold, and diarrhea when consuming cold food. Upon examination, the body appears thin, but the abdomen is large.<br>(Note: The neck has pivotal points like Fengchi and Fengfu, which is why there is excessive sweating. The stomach channel is affected by evils, leading to difficulty in eating and drinking, blockage of the diaphragm, and abdominal fullness. When stomach qi is deficient, the front of the body feels cold, and abdominal distension occurs; thus, if the person feels cold, the abdomen distends, and if they drink cold, they experience diarrhea, indicating damage from weak stomach qi. The stomach corresponds to flesh, and the abdomen reflects the stomach&#39;s reservoir, hence the appearance of being thin yet having a large abdomen.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Reversal Symptoms</h3>
<p>When the lesser yang is in reversal, the mechanisms are not functioning properly; one cannot walk with the waist, nor turn the neck. [Note: The lesser yang governs the joints, hence when its energy is in reversal, the mechanisms are impaired. The neck is where the three yangs converge; the waist and spine are the major joints of the body. Therefore, if the mechanisms are impaired, one cannot turn to walk with the waist, nor turn the neck.]</p>
<p>When the hand of the greater yang is in reversal, there is deafness and tears flow out; one cannot turn to view, nor look up or down with the waist, as it indicates ailments that the physician must address. [Note: The conditions produced by the hand of the greater yang include deafness. The small intestine governs fluids, hence its reversal results in tears. The heart governs blood vessels, and the small intestine, which pertains to liquid, is the exterior of the heart. When the energy of the small intestine is in reversal, the fluids cannot nourish the channels, leading to the inability to turn the neck or move the waist. The area between the waist and neck is where the major channels and collaterals converge.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Febrile Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Qibo said: If febrile disease lasts for one day, it affects the Greater Yang, hence the pain in the head and neck, and the stiffness in the lower back. 【Note: The solar qi governs the skin and hair; therefore, if febrile disease lasts one day, it is influenced by the solar energy. Since the Yang energy is upward, there is pain in the head and neck. The back is associated with Yang, hence the stiffness in the lower back.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Abdominal Conditions</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: There is a disease characterized by swelling in the chest, pain in the neck, fullness in the chest, and abdominal distension. What is this disease? How does one acquire it? Qibo replied: This is called &quot;reversal of qi.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essential Truths of the Great Principles</strong></p>
<p>When the Greater Yin governs the heavens, if dampness overcomes it, then it sinks and disperses, causing rain, withering, swelling, bone pain, and Yin obstructive syndromes. Yin obstruction means that pressing on it yields no effect, with stiffness in the lower back and pain in the head and neck. 【Note: The dampness dominating above causes the Yin to sink and disperse, causing plants to wither and resulting in swelling and Yin obstruction, all triggered by cold dampness. The disease in the Yin is termed &quot;obstruction,&quot; hence pressing yields no effect. The kidneys govern bones, and the bladder is their associated organ, thus causing pain in the lower back, head, and neck bones.】 </p>
<p>When the Greater Yin prevails, fire energy becomes congested internally, leading to ulcers inside and dispersing externally, affecting the sides. In severe cases, there may be heart pain and heat afflictions, headaches, throat obstructions, and stiffness in the neck. 【Note: When dampness and heat are excessive outside, fire energy becomes congested internally, causing ulcers. When the heat and damp energy disperses outward, it affects the sides. In severe cases, heart pain results when wood energy is excessive and transmits to fire.】<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>Headaches with neck stiffness and throat tightness are caused by a mixture of wind, heat, and dampness, ascending from the neck to the crown of the head. When the Yang energy overwhelms, heat rises, causing pain in the head and neck, making the eyes appear protruded. The rising of heat refers to the Yang energy that ascends through the channels into the brain, then descends into the lower neck. The return of the Yin results in dampness rising, leading to heaviness and increased sensitivity in the head and neck. This heaviness and sensitivity are particularly severe because of dampness, as if the head is wrapped. When dampness is not expelled, the large and small muscles become affected—tightness leads to rigidity, while relaxation leads to weakness. When the Lesser Yin governs, if the external force overcomes, it results in sneezing, neck stiffness, heat in the shoulders and back, and headaches. This reflects the dominance of cold, watery Yang energy manifesting in stiffness and pain in the head and neck. All manifestations of stiffness and cramps in the neck are related to dampness, reflecting the气 (qi) of the five zang organs as they present in the physical form.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>The Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Pathogenic Qi and Disease of the Organs</strong></p>
<p>When the pathogenic factor enters a person and affects the neck, it descends to the Taiyang.<br>[Note: This refers to the Taiyang&#39;s influence as it moves up the neck and affects the head and face.]</p>
<p><strong>On Diagnosis of Diseases</strong></p>
<p>When examining a person&#39;s eye sockets, if there is a slight swelling resembling a new awakening, and when the neck pulse is active, there is coughing upon pressing the hands and feet, it indicates swelling from wind water.<br>[Note: The pulse of the feet at the Taiyang originates at the two eyes and exits at the neck. The cold water from the Taiyang primarily governs this area. The Yang energy flows on the skin&#39;s surface, and thus the water mingles with the air and surges between the skin, causing slight swelling in the eye sockets. If the pulse moves and there is skin swelling accompanied by coughing, it indicates water retention in the skin, affecting the lung’s qi. Wind water arises from external exposure to wind, leading to the dispersion of water.]</p>
<p><strong>On Cold and Heat Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The five internal organs correspond to five regions of the body: the Futu (Hidden Rabbit) is one; the knee is two (the knee refers to the spleen); the back is three; the five organ points are four; and the neck is five. Anyone with a carbuncle in these five areas is bound to die.<br>[Note: Futu refers to the area of the kidneys. The knee corresponds to the spleen&#39;s region. The back relates to the lung&#39;s points. The points of the five organs are called the heart points of the five vertebrae. The neck corresponds to the liver&#39;s points. This text states: the emergence of a carbuncle does not arise from heaven or earth, but from the accumulation of subtleties. Therefore, the presence of a carbuncle in these five areas represents the gradual accumulation of toxic stagnation from the five organs, responding externally to the disharmony of blood and qi. Thus, anyone with this condition in these regions is bound to die.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>This section discusses the pulse points in relation to different meridians. </p>
<ol>
<li>At the center of the hollow of the abdomen is the Ren meridian, known as Tiantu (Heavenly Trough).</li>
<li>The first pulse at the side of the Ren meridian corresponds to the Yangming meridian, known as Renying (Human Response).</li>
<li>The second pulse corresponds to the Shaoyang meridian, known as Futuo (Supporting Trough).</li>
<li>The third pulse corresponds to the Taiyang meridian, known as Tiankuang (Heavenly Window).</li>
<li>The fourth pulse corresponds to the Shaoyang meridian, known as Tianrong (Heavenly Appearance).</li>
<li>The fifth pulse corresponds to the Shaoyang meridian, known as Tianyou (Heavenly Opening).</li>
<li>The sixth pulse corresponds to the Taiyang meridian, known as Tianzhu (Heavenly Pillar).<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>[Note: The major tendons are among the neck and back.]</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The central pulse in the neck is the governing vessel, called Fengfu (Wind Palace). <strong>[Note: In discussing the three Yang meridians, they ascend sequentially through the neck, responding to the Yang qi emerging from outside the earth, while the Ren and Du vessels originate from the kidneys and connect to the primordial Yin and Yang.]</strong> The Yangming in the foot is the artery alongside the throat, with its point located in the chest. The hand Yangming follows, situated outside its point, not extending more than an inch to the cheek. The hand Taiyang is at the cheek curve. The foot Shaoyang is behind the cheek near the ear. The hand Shaoyang exits behind the ear and ascends above the occiput. The foot Taiyang runs alongside the major tendon of the neck, starting from the hairline. <strong>[Note: This discusses the rise and fall of Yang qi to correspond to the ascent and descent of atmospheric conditions.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cold and Heat Section</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo: What kind of qi gives rise to cold, heat, and scrofula located in the neck and armpits? Qi Bo replied: These are all due to the toxic qi of cold and heat from the mouse, which lingers in the meridians and does not leave. <strong>[Note: The toxic qi of cold and heat, stored in the organs below and connecting to the neck and armpits, becomes scrofula. This is the water poison of the kidney as primordial. When the heavens open at Zi (the Rat), the first heaven generates water; its poison is external, hence called ‘mouse.’ The pulse at the neck and armpits is from the Shaoyang meridian; Shaoyang is the initial Yang qi, arising within the primordial water, and it also connects with the qi of the kidney, thus this meridian is said to belong to the kidney.]</strong><a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor said: How can one determine life and death? Qi Bo replied: Observe the eyes; within them are red veins that run through the pupil. If one vein is seen, death will occur in one year; if one and a half veins are seen, death will occur in one and a half years; if two veins are seen, two years until death; if two and a half veins are seen, two and a half years until death; if three veins are seen, death will occur in three years. If the red vein does not run through the pupil, healing is possible.</p>
<p>(Note: The organ shapes of the Jue Yin and Shao Yang are located in the lower part of the heart and middle burner, and both types of energy originate from the kidneys. The pupil is the &#39;bone eye&#39; of the water organ. The red vein running up and down through the pupil signifies toxic energy of the water organ, which collides with the fire organ&#39;s toxic energy and subsequently affects the water organ&#39;s &#39;bone eye.&#39; This interaction of yin and yang leads to an incurable death. The toxicity inside the organs prevents movement and release, hence it ruptures the veins, resulting in a severe illness. The single vein signifies severe toxicity of the water organ, causing one-year death; two veins signify the toxicity spreading to the fire organ, leading to a two-year death; three veins mean the toxic energy is distributed between the two organs, causing a death after three years. The more concentrated the toxicity, the more severe the harm, thus leading to quicker death. The &#39;fraction&#39; indicates a slower death. One and a half veins fall between one and two years; two and a half veins fall between two and three years.)<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatise on Abscesses</h3>
<p>Abscesses occurring on the neck are called premature abscesses. These abscesses are large, with a red-black color; if not treated urgently, the heat will descend into the depths of the armpit, damaging the Ren meridian and internally affecting the liver and lungs. If the liver and lungs are affected, death will occur within ten days.</p>
<h3>Urgent Stiffness of the Neck</h3>
<p>The patient has a fever and cold feet, with a stiff and urgent neck, chills, intermittent heat in the head, a flushed face, red eyes, and a distinct shaking of the head, along with suddenly clenched jaws and an arched back; this signifies tetanus. If sweating occurs, cold and dampness will worsen the condition, and the exterior becomes more deficient, leading to intensified chills. After sweating, the pulse feels like a snake.</p>
<h3>Pulsation of the Neck</h3>
<p>If the cun pulse is deep and slippery, there is water present. If the face is swollen and hot, it is called wind-water. If the eyes appear slightly protruded, like a newly hatched silkworm, and there is a pulsation in the neck with frequent coughing, accompanied by a hand or foot that sinks when pressed and does not rebound, it is also wind-water.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Prescription</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Nine Leaks</strong>  </p>
<p>When lumps appear first on the neck or armpits, they are likely to be leaks. It is advisable to avoid five pungent foods, wine, flour, and all hot dishes. These leaks resemble stone carbuncles, appearing as lumps with the cores located in both necks and under the arms, causing no pain or heat. For treatment, one should apply a powder of calcined stone externally and internally take a Five Spice and Forsythia decoction to purge them. If they have already ruptured, treat as for carbuncles. For unbroken lumps, a fire needle should be used, inserting the needle into the center of the lump for complete resolution. What are the Nine Leaks? They are: first, wolf leak; second, rat leak; third, mole cricket leak; fourth, sorcery leak; fifth, ant leak; sixth, larvae leak; seventh, floating leak; eighth, scrofula leak; ninth, turning pulse leak.</p>

<p><strong>Neck Carbuncle Toxin</strong>  </p>
<p>This toxin arises from the five organs being poisoned, with Qi stagnation and blood depletion, lurking between the wind pavilion, indicating a serious condition. One should use a Dispersing Toxin and Flowing Qi Decoction to treat it, followed by an internal Releasing Flowing Qi Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Toxin Neck Carbuncle</strong>  </p>
<p>There are robust individuals, well accustomed to drinking alcohol, who travel in intense heat, become inebriated while aboard a vessel, and lie exposed to the wind. Additionally, when influenced by the sun’s warmth and emotional disturbances, they return home unable to resist desires, and suddenly experience pain in the neck, reminiscent of a lost pillow. What is this? It is the poison of wind and heat locking the throat. Over time, redness develops around the shoulders and back, becoming hard and difficult to resolve. Urgently take a Cooling Heat and Releasing Wind Powder.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Luo Li (Scrofula)</strong></p>
<p>This condition is primarily governed by the Hand Shaoyang Sanjiao Meridian. Generally, this meridian is characterized by an abundance of qi and a deficiency of blood, arising from shock, worry, and contemplation. This disease initially manifests beneath the ear and between the neck, extending down to the jaw and into the supraclavicular fossa, appearing subtly beneath the skin. Initially, it emerges like a bean and gradually grows to resemble a plum pit, sometimes appearing as one, or three to five nodules. When pressed, they move slightly and cause mild pain; there is no fever, only a slight maturation in the afternoon or nighttime dryness in the mouth, diminished appetite, and fatigue in the limbs. They remain firm and do not rupture; when they do rupture, they do not heal, all due to insufficient qi and blood, often transforming into phthisis. Patients may feel redness and swelling that can appear above or below, to the left or right, often in clusters of three to five, rupturing and releasing pus and blood, leading to the formation of scrofula. Singular lumps are termed tubercles; those that tend to connect are referred to as scrofula. However, this condition is not caused by rich foods but rather by a combination of deficiency and stagnant qi. Therefore, it requires treatment with tonics to nourish qi and blood, allowing the sores to resolve naturally. Using harsh or drastic medicines will damage the blood and qi further and hinder recovery. If not treated promptly, it could lead to fatality.</p>
<p>Madao Chuang (Horse-Cutter Ulcer) is also governed by the Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian, which, like the Sanjiao Meridian, is characterized by an abundance of qi and a deficiency of blood. This may appear in front of or behind the ear, beneath the ear extending to the jaw, or in the chest and sides, or along the flanks, persisting firm without breaking. All of these are regarded as Madao Chuang. Thus, they are more firm than soft, with pus appearing white and resembling thin soup or dirty water. Those treating it should seek a clear liquid. If the external appearance resembles that of a clam, it is classified as Madao Chuang.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Jing Tong (Neck Pain)</strong></p>
<p>For swelling and pain in the neck, with fullness in the chest and distention in the abdomen, it indicates excess above and deficiency below, with qi stagnation and reversal. This condition has an abundance of yang qi trapped in the chest; acupuncture is not appropriate. It is advisable to take a remedy to smooth qi, like Shunqi Decoction or Xiaofuling Decoction. If there is kidney heat, symptoms will include lower back pain and soreness, thirst with a desire for hot drinks; when heat stirs, it causes pain in the neck and tightness, while the legs are cold and sore, making the person unwilling to speak. The classic states: If sweating occurs with a floating pulse, one dies; if the pulse does not respond to sweating, two die; if one speaks crazily and loses one&#39;s faculties, three die. All these result from stagnant emotions that cannot be relieved, leading to peril.</p>
<p><strong>Luo Li Lun (On Lumps)</strong></p>
<p>Lumps are what the classics refer to as tubercles. They might appear before or behind the ear, extending to the jaw, connected below to the supraclavicular fossa—these are all lumps. If present in the chest or on the side of the chest, extending down to both sides of the lower ribs, these are termed &quot;Ma Dao.&quot; The Shao Yang meridian governs these cases. This meridian has more qi than blood, hence it tends to be hard rather than soft, with pus being white and thin like rinse water. The practitioner should seek clear water for treatment. If lumps arise in other meridians, one should follow the corresponding acupuncture points as per the classic &quot;Bronze Man&quot; and use medicinal treatments according to the meridian involved. A single small lump represents a tubercle, while several connected forms are referred to as lumps; those that resemble a clam shell on the surface are called &quot;Ma Dao.&quot;<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Ming</strong><br><strong>(By Jin Cheng Wu Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stiff Neck</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold damage causing stiff neck, how can we clarify it? The Taiyang channel begins at the inner canthus of the eye, crosses over the top of the head, enters the brain, then exits down the neck, traveling along the shoulder and arm, and internally alongside the spine, reaching the waist. The classic text states: &quot;In Taiyang disease, there is stiffness and pain in the head and neck accompanied by aversion to cold.&quot; When the Taiyang channel is affected by wind and cold, the meridians become obstructed, resulting in tension in the neck and stiffness in the nape. When there is stiffness and urgency in the neck from cold damage, this indicates a Taiyang exterior syndrome; it should definitely be treated by dispersing and resolving it. In Taiyang disease, if there is stiffness in the neck and back along with sweating and aversion to wind, Gui Zhi Jia Ge Gen Tang is the main remedy. If there is stiffness in the neck and back without sweating and with aversion to wind, Ge Gen Tang is the main remedy. Both are dispersing agents. Both cases present with stiffness in the neck and back, yet their dispersal has variations in severity. The case with fever, sweating, and aversion to wind suggests an exterior deficiency; the exterior deficiency can be resolved by relaxing the muscles. The case without sweating and with aversion to wind indicates an exterior excess; in this case, we can induce sweating. Hence, the treatments differ. The formula Gui Zhi Jia Ge Gen Tang consists of Gui Zhi combined with Ma Huang and Ge Gen, while Ge Gen Tang is different.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>In Gui Zhi Decoction, when Ma Huang and Ge Gen are added, upon detailed examination, if there are no sweat and aversion to wind, this indicates a true excess condition, thus it is appropriate to add Ma Huang and Ge Gen to Gui Zhi Decoction to promote sweating. If sweating is present with aversion to wind, this is a sign of exterior deficiency; in cases of exterior deficiency, one can release the muscles, and it is likely that only Ge Gen should be added to Gui Zhi Decoction without Ma Huang. </p>
<p>The term &quot;Ba&quot; refers to a distinctive appearance of raising the neck. &quot;Ba&quot; also refers to a short-feathered bird. A short-feathered bird cannot soar and when it moves, it first stretches and raises its head and ears. Those with strong neck and back move in the same manner, unlike those who bend down weakly. In cases of Tai Yang injury with stiff neck and back, this may be due to a combination of Tai Yang wind and cold damp, resulting in stiffness. Spasms are also linked to neck stiffness. </p>
<p>The classics state: A patient with fever and cold feet, stiff and urgent neck, aversion to cold, occasional fever in the head, red face, and red eyes presents with dynamic head and face movements. The original text is lacking; according to the &quot;Jin Gui,&quot; for the symptoms of spasms from damp heat, the pulse changes in the second section may be altered. &quot;Yao&quot; refers to the phenomenon of suddenly closing the mouth and arching the back, indicative of spasms. The &quot;Jin Gui Yao Lue&quot; states that in Tai Yang conditions, if there is neck and back stiffness and the pulse feels deep and slow, this indicates spasms, and Gui Zhi plus (herb) Lou Decoction is the treatment. </p>
<p>Even with neck and back stiffness, the exterior symptoms in Tai Yang conditions should be completely dispersible. There is also the condition of chest binding, where the neck is similarly stiff as in spasms. In such cases, if purged, it will harmonize, and Da Xianxiong Wan should be employed. When faced with illness, carefully analyze the exterior and interior conditions; treatments may involve sweating or purging according to the symptoms, and then the treatment will be thorough.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Medical Effectiveness of the World</p>
<p>Soft Neck</p>
<p>For children whose necks become soft due to wind, causing their heads to tilt forward or backward, it is advisable to use Tianzhu Pill and Wujia Pi Powder; if the soft neck is caused by wind-heat, combined use of Cool Liver Pill is recommended.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Lymphadenitis</strong></p>
<p>Lymphadenitis refers to tuberculous swellings. It may appear behind the ear, in front of the ear, below the ear extending to the jaw, or beneath the neck connecting to the collarbone; all of these are termed lymphadenitis. If it occurs on the chest or its sides, or on both sides of the ribcage, it is referred to as &quot;horse blade.&quot; The hand and foot Shaoyang channels govern it. Tuberculous swellings may exist in front of and behind the ear, or beneath the ear and jaw; all are considered lymphadenitis. Use two dou (a unit of measure) of fully ripe dark mulberries, extract the natural juice using a cloth bag without touching copper or iron, and boil it slowly over gentle fire to make a thin ointment. Take one spoonful of this each time with boiling soup after meals, three times a day.</p>
<p><strong>Ritual of Filial Piety</strong> (by Zhang Congzheng, Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Lymphadenitis</strong></p>
<p>If there are sores or swellings on the head, or between the chest and ribs, or if there are scabs and swellings that do not disperse, or if there is persistent pus and fluid, one may use one to two ounces of salt treated in a pan, boil it with a large bowl of flowing water until warm, and take it in three to five doses. After a short while, one can probe the throat, producing two to three liters of saliva; afterward, take medications that invigorate the blood and regulate menstruation, such as Yuzhu Powder or Siwu Decoction. The Inner Canon states: &quot;Salty flavor promotes secretion and is associated with Yin.&quot; To &quot;secrete&quot; means to expel, and to &quot;release&quot; means to purge. The &quot;Bronze Man&quot; text states: &quot;Shaoyang begins at the eyes, travels behind the ears, descends to the sides of the ribs, and passes the phase gate.&quot; Lymphadenitis and tuberculous swellings mixed with goiter is a disorder of the Shaoyang gallbladder channel characterized by excess Qi and deficiency of blood. </p>

<p>From below the ear to the collarbone, or extending to the shoulder, sores appear hard as stone, and when moved do not have a root; this is called horse knife sores, coming from the lesser yang meridian of the hands and feet. They may appear on both sides of the lower ribs; some may have already become pus-filled sores, and some may not have ruptured yet. The remedies include Lonicera dispersing hard decoction. </p>
<p>Horse knife sores typically start with the emergence of one sore. Use a four-cornered iron ring to secure it in place, preventing it from moving, and create an opening in it, then cover it with oil paper twisted into a wick, ensuring it does not heal over, thereby cutting off the source of the sore, and the effect is swift. If the sore does not rupture, or if the patient is unwilling to rupture it, apply medicine to the sore, changing it every two days, primarily using Longquan powder.</p>
<p><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method</strong> 【Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng】</p>
<p><strong>Scrofula, Tuberculosis, Goiter</strong></p>
<p>Scrofula initially arises from the lesser yang meridian; if one does not observe dietary restrictions, it will inevitably extend to the yangming meridian. In general, the excessiveness of food flavors and the accumulation of stagnant qi, referred to as toxin, wind, and heat, all stem from these three aspects and must differentiate between deficiency and excess. The excess type is indeed easy to treat; however, unless one completely avoids rich and gas-producing foods, it remains difficult and quite concerning. As it pertains to the gallbladder meridian, it governs decisions, possessing mutual fire with more qi and less blood. For women who experience this during menstruation, if not suffering from cold or heat, they may conceive; but if it lingers, it may turn into tidal heat, which poses a serious risk. Unless one can decisively eliminate thoughts of rich foods, even the divine and holy cannot treat it. Scrofula is associated with blood, qi, phlegm, and heat; using ground oyster shells prepared through calcination as a powder, and元參 (rehu) pounded into paste forms pills.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>For mulberries that are black and ripe, crush them to extract the juice and boil it down to a paste for taking with soup; for red ones, dry them and grind them into powder for consumption with soup. </p>
<p>Summer cress can effectively disperse stagnation and nourish the blood vessels, able to expel cold and heat; those who are deficient can rely on it, while those who are more robust should complement it with dispersing medications. Additionally, external application of moxibustion gradually yields results. </p>
<p>For swellings or lumps, which may occur in the neck, arms, or the body as toxic swellings, these are often beneath the skin surface, typically caused by phlegm forming into lumps that do not disperse. Inquire about the patient&#39;s usual diet, and after purging, use medications to disperse the lumps. If a lump is under the chin, use Erchen Decoction with wine-fried rhubarb, forsythia, platycodon, and bupleurum; for a lump in the arm, combine Erchen Decoction with forsythia, saposhnikovia, chuanxiong, wine-fried scutellaria, atractylodes, spiky sophora fruit, silkworm, and musk to mobilize the phlegm of the Taiyin and Jueyin channels, facilitating the resolution of the lumps, which is quite effective. </p>
<p>For goiter, one must first avoid heavy flavors.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>For nodules that form under the neck and threaten to develop into goiter, take one pound of seaweed, wash away the salt, and soak it in wine to drink.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment for Lymphatic Tumors</strong></p>
<p>The disease of lymphatic tumors has many names. The &quot;Chao&#39;s Disease Sources&quot; records thirty-six types, while the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; and &quot;Holy Virtue&quot; texts discuss nine types. Generally, it is said to differ due to wind poison, heat poison, or air poison. The lymphatic nodules arise from the contrast of cold and heat, fundamentally caused by anger and suppressed feelings, excessive worry, and the invasion of wind and heat evils attacking the liver. Anger harms the liver, which governs the tendons, causing them to swell and accumulate. Symptoms often arise in areas between the neck and armpits, forming clusters that start as small as a bean and later grow to the size of a plum pit, interconnected and varying in size. Initially, there may be chills followed by fever, and strong pain in the throat and neck. If the swelling does not subside, one should promptly take Five Spices and Forsythia Decoction or Oysters and Rhubarb Decoction to clear three or two passages. Additionally, apply Ten Fragrance Ointment and Black Rhinoceros Ointment on top, and when employing the Abscess-Draining Decoction or Toxic Soothing Decoction, continue to drain if needed. Following this treatment will lead to resolution.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>If it has not dissipated, you may take internal dissolution pills or soapberry pills, gradually seeking improvement. If the swelling is deep and hard, and with the passing of time, it cannot dissolve internally, it will inevitably turn into pus. If the swelling is raised and slightly soft, and the person&#39;s complexion is pale yellow, with skin heat and ascending pus already formed, you may puncture and drain the core to facilitate its dispersal and promote healing.</p>
<p>Treatment method: Similar to treating sores, apply a corrosive and flesh-eroding medication at the sore&#39;s opening, and on top apply ointments like black rhinoceros ten fragrance paste. If there is no improvement after a long period, or if it heals only to recur, or if it forms another hole elsewhere, and pus flows continuously and the body becomes emaciated, it may turn into a fistula. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states: &quot;A trapped pulse is a fistula, lingering in the flesh&#39;s layers; this refers to this condition.&quot; You can use garlic cakes for moxibustion; then, apply medicines like purple gold powder and emerald mist powder on the sore, followed by medicinal plasters to seek healing. Take care to treat it with caution and precision, and do not act carelessly in treatment.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Essentials of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Siguang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luo Li (Scrofula)</strong></p>
<p>The disease of scrofula is caused by the stagnation and obstruction of blood and Qi, rooted in the organs. It often manifests as lumps on the neck, varying in size, accompanied by intermittent fever and chills, with pus and blood oozing out. Sometimes one lump subsides while another appears. It is advisable to consume rice drink mixed with powdered桂 (cinnamon) and滑石 (talc) of two qian (a unit of measure) every other night. When the morning bell rings, take the black and white powder; it will definitely produce substances resembling grape flesh, which will exit through urine in several pieces, leading to the resolution of the swollen masses. Additionally, regularly take the Siqi Decoction with added 香木 (fragrant wood) or the Suzi Decoction for relieving Qi.  </p>
<p>Those lumps encircling the neck, commonly referred to as &quot;coiling snake scrofula,&quot; are difficult to treat. First, grind 石菖蒲 (Acorus calamus) into a paste, slightly break the skin of the affected area, and then burn cat&#39;s fur to ash, mixing it with scented oil to apply on the affected place. A powdered white蔹 (a type of medicinal herb), taken mixed with wine, is very effective. It is also beneficial to take a sip of wine and apply the white powder onto the affected area. Utilizing fresh specimens is especially good. Alternatively, mixing water from a pig&#39;s gall bladder with powdered雄黄 (realgar) and applying it to the affected area is also effective.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p>
<h3>Medical Compendium [Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying]</h3>
<h4>Scrofula</h4>
<p>The early description states: Scrofula commonly appears on the shoulders and neck, sometimes red, sometimes white, sometimes hard, sometimes soft. Initially, it resembles a bean; over time, it becomes like a seed. As time passes, it may grow as large as a plum or an egg and can appear in clusters, sometimes in pairs or threes, or as many as six or seven. This is often referred to as &quot;coiled snake scrofula.&quot; Symptoms include effort and anxiety, which lead to phlegm, pain, and redness, warranting early treatment as the best option. </p>
<p>For flowing scrofula, which is more often found in women, its nature is impatient, with stagnant energy and a persistent mind. Initially appearing on the neck, once it breaks, pus flows to the limbs and causes body-wide toxicity, resembling plums or plums. If untreated, it may burst on its own, creating openings through which cold and hot pain occurs or pus flows, thus it is named flowing scrofula, also referred to as &quot;thousand-year sores.&quot; It is advisable to take the &quot;Tuo Li Jiu Ku Shen Ying Wan&quot; (Pill to Rescue from Suffering); if the pulse is strong, first use &quot;Zhui Shen San&quot; (Pursuing Spirit Powder) before taking the Rescue Pill.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The single-nodule swelling, which appears at the neck, is particularly difficult to treat. It is recommended to use the previously mentioned medicine, and over time it may resolve on its own. If it appears at the occipital bone, it is also hard to treat. Toxic medications can be used, but they should not be allowed to soak for long periods. </p>
<p>The lotus seed swelling consists of one capsule containing ten or more seeds, growing on either side of the neck. It can be felt and moves when touched, and medication can still be used for treatment. However, if it is hard and immovable, it should not be treated. It is associated with aversion to cold, fever, irritability, and thirst; when these symptoms occur, it is very challenging to treat, even the most skilled cannot do much.</p>
<p>The heavy terrace swelling appears on the neck, either left or right, initially as a single nodule at the top or bottom, later presenting in layers. This condition cannot be treated with medication or acupuncture. If it causes pain and thirst with phlegm due to toxic progression, it can be life-threatening. At the first sign, urgently use small rhinoceros horn pills or powdered gold for treatment.</p>
<p>The swallow nest swelling resembles a nest and cannot be treated.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Li Zhen]</p>
<p><strong>Stiff Neck due to Typhoid</strong></p>
<p>If the neck is hard and cannot turn left or right, with initial symptoms of sunstroke, where the exterior is solid and there is no sweating, administer Gegen Decoction; if the exterior is weak with sweating, use Cinnamon Twig Decoction with added Gegen. If wrongly purged, the evil qi can invade internally through the vacuum, causing chest distension and persistence of neck stiffness, termed &quot;distended chest with stiff neck.&quot; Use Large Abdominal Distension Pill or Combined Middle Regulation Pill, or take Four Reversal Decoction. Therefore, when Yin Toxicity first causes pain, neck stiffness may also occur; all should be treated with heat-clearing medicines, such as Zhengyang San or Fuzi Decoction. If neck stiffness is accompanied by fullness in the lower ribs, use Minor Chaihu Decoction. Additionally, there are instances of wind-dampness causing neck stiffness and spasmodic neck stiffness, which must not be neglected in diagnosis.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Neck Sores Treatment Guide</strong></p>
<p>Yang toxins in the six fu organs gather at the crown, specifically ruled by the Sun Meridian Bladder. If it occurs at the back of the neck, the sore has a head pointing upwards and a tail pointing downwards, resembling a honeycomb, which is a sign of a reversal. In cases of swelling and pain, one should urgently use &quot;Tuo Li San&quot; with the additions of &quot;Sheng Ma,&quot; &quot;Chi Shao,&quot; and &quot;Jie Geng&quot; to ward off toxins attacking the heart. If phlegm emerges or flows into both shoulders, it is untreatable. </p>
<p>If a sore arises directly behind the head, it is termed &quot;Yao Ju,&quot; appearing large, dark purple or black; urgent treatment is unnecessary. Heat penetrates into the deep fluids, damaging the Ren channel and internally burning the liver and lungs, leading to death within ten days. </p>
<p>For painful swelling, with thirst and a preference for cold water, one should use detoxifying soup with &quot;Tian Hua Fen&quot; to eliminate phlegm, heat, and dampness; or use &quot;Huang Lian Xiao Du San,&quot; &quot;Dang Gui Qiang Huo Tang,&quot; &quot;Qing Re Xiao Du Yin,&quot; or &quot;Huo Ming Yin&quot; as options. </p>
<p>For swelling and pain with dry mouth and thirst, with a preference for hot soup, it may indicate kidney Yang deficiency with fiery heat, for which one should use &quot;Tuo Li Xiao Du San,&quot; &quot;Tuo Li Yi Qi Tang,&quot; &quot;Shen Qi Wan,&quot; or &quot;Ba Wei Wan.&quot; If there is diffuse swelling, slight pain, and reduced appetite, use &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang.&quot; If there is excessive phlegm, use &quot;Tuo Li Qing Zhong Tang.&quot; However, if it appears dark and does not rupture or respond, it indicates depletion of Yin essence, termed &quot;Nao Shuo,&quot; and is untreatable.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Luo Li and Ma Dao</strong></p>
<p>Luo Li appears at the front side of the neck, forming lumps like large beans or ginkgo nuts; it is called Luo Li. Ma Dao develops in the chest, abdomen, and underarms, hard as stone, resembling the shape of a horse knife worm; it is called Ma Dao. These conditions arise from the pathogen of qi deficiency and blood deficiency, which originates from the lesser yang fire of the hands and feet. The areas before and behind the ears and at the shoulder blades belong to the lower limb lesser yang; extending to the chin, neck, cheeks, and jaw pertains to the upper limb yang brightness; if it extends to the central chest, specifically to the Zhongfu and Yunmen areas of the lung meridian, it results in death. </p>
<p>Wind-induced lumps are sharp and small; heat-induced lumps are swollen and red, also known as blood lumps or phlegm lumps, which are pushed and soft; qi lumps are round and mobile; there are also mouse remnants, varying in size. Without phlegm, there can be no lumps. For the initial emergence of all luo, those that are solid are primarily treated by transforming phlegm, commonly using the Erchen Decoction with added Fangfeng, Jiegeng, Huangqin, and Zhuli. For chest tightness, this method of inducing vomiting is particularly effective. To open the meridians, the use of scorpions (mandibles) is essential, facilitating urination to drain heart fire; ancient prescriptions like Xiaofengsan and Liying San are indeed effective.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>However, these two medicines are very strong, and after taking them, one should adjust according to the body&#39;s condition. For those with a strong constitution and excess wind-heat, follow with the Heat-expelling Pill. For those with a weak constitution, use the Strengthening the Spleen and Qi Decoction, or the Eight Herbs Decoction combined with the Two Expectorants, taking it frequently to help the sores heal. If very weak, one should first take strengthening the Spleen medicines, and then take the two powders. In milder cases, just using the Dan Chicken Pill will suffice. For those with abundant stomach heat, take the White Silkworm Pill, or the Purging Pus and Detoxifying Powder, or the Soft and Hard Soap Pill. For the Shaoyang stage, use the Chaihu Regulating Qi Decoction; for the Yangming stage, use the Shengma Adjusting Menstrual Decoction; for those involving both the Shaoyang and Yangming channels, combine the two decoctions. If there are excessive downward movements, one should avoid impeding the menstrual cycle or causing other prohibited conditions. </p>
<p>To clear the liver, if the gallbladder and liver are affected, the tendons will feel tight like stringed pearls, with cold and heat in pain, indicating that the liver qi is disturbed and causing illness. The primary focus should be on clearing liver heat, supplemented by nourishing the blood. If the cold and heat cease but the sores do not heal, it indicates that liver blood is dry and causing illness, so the emphasis should be on nourishing the blood, with liver-clearing as a supplement. Use formulas such as the Clearing Liver and Nourishing Essence Decoction, the Gardenia Clearing Liver Decoction, or the Chaihu Clearing Liver Decoction selectively.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>If the sore resembles a bean, attached to muscle, with no color change, accompanied by internal heat, dry mouth, and fatigue, and does not resolve over time, then the liver pulse is tight and the kidney pulse is rapid. This indicates that kidney water cannot nourish wood, leading to liver blood heat movement, muscle cramps, and the prohibition of using wind-drying medications. If there is long-term ulceration with profuse pus and blood leakage, this indicates a further depletion of the spleen and kidneys, and fire inflammation in the lungs. It is advisable to focus on Kidney Qi Pills and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Pills, along with Xiao Yao San added with radix platycodi, Ophiopogon japonicus, and Scrophularia, to clear lung fire. For those who are easily angered with liver fire, use Qing Gan Jie Yu Decoction; if there are cold and heat symptoms, use Dan Xia Ku Cao San. If the liver fire is very strong, or if there is itching near the bones due to worms, use Aloe Pills, the commonly used Pig Head Pills, or Seaweed Harden Pills; externally treat with Yin You San, Silkworm Cocoon Powder, or Cat Bat Powder. For the weak, use Dan Xia Ku Cao Ointment internally and apply with sesame oil externally. For those who have developed a chronic leakage, initially warm and disperse wind-cold, and address damp heat from the kidney channel; over time, greatly supplement Qi and blood, and use fumigation and washing medications to smooth the skin and clear the orifices.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The ancient method known as the White Snake Powder treats scrofula that has developed into an ulcer. It contains Qian Niu, which can benefit the kidney meridian by eliminating harmful moisture and preventing excessive drainage through openings. However, it must be adjusted according to the individual&#39;s condition, avoiding excessive wine, lust, and greed. </p>
<p>For women with irregular menstruation or amenorrhea without tidal fever, treatment is possible, but if there is tidal fever or coughing with amenorrhea, it is often fatal. The ancient method employs the Jade Candle Powder to treat scrofula and regulate blood flow. Taking it will lead to self-healing, with a daily dose showing results within seven to eight days. For those not experiencing amenorrhea, the Chai Hu Decoction for Menstrual Regulation and the Sheng Ma Decoction for Menstrual Adjustment are recommended. For long-standing deficiencies, add the Modified Xiao Yao Powder or the Qing Gan Yi Rong Decoction, or use the Er Chen Decoction combined with the Si Wu Decoction, adding ingredients like oyster shell, Chai Hu, Huang Qin, Yuan Shen, and Shen Qu, ground into a powder, mixed with mulberry syrup to form pills the size of mung beans. Take fifty pills with warm wine, or opt for the Shen Qi Pills for even better results.</p>
<p>Scrofula is a hallmark of ulcerative diseases, and thus diseases of the lungs indicate that if there are lumps in the abdomen or nodes on the neck, they are particularly difficult to treat, especially when they develop into ulcers. One must clear the heat and nourish the kidney and spleen. If a patient does not maintain a calm mind and light diet, they risk profuse sweating, thirst, and diarrhea, leading to severe complications. By observing the eyes, if several red veins cross the pupil, one can estimate the years until death. If the complexion is pale, with a strong pulse, it indicates profound deficiency of vital energy and is considered untreatable. Hence, it is said that real excess can be treated, but true deficiency should be approached with caution.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Phlegm Nodules</p>
<p>Nodules in the neck are neither red nor painful, do not form pus, and can be moved when pushed; these are phlegm accumulations that do not disperse. It is inappropriate to hastily use medications for scrofula. Treatment should be a modified Erchen Decoction with Dahuang (rhubarb), Lianqiao (forsythia), Chaihu (bulbous chive), and Jiegeng (platycodon). For those with a thin physique, modify the Erchen Decoction by adding Jiegeng, Huangqin (scutellaria), Yuanshen (root of the Chinese peony), Mai Men Dong (ophiopogon), and a little Fangfeng (siler), along with Zhuli (bamboo juice); frequent intake helps dissolve the nodules. </p>
<p>If there are lumps behind the ears or between the neck, each with one nodule, they should be dissolved with a Dan (pills). Nodules in the arms, or causing slight pain, are due to the absence of pus; thus, although swollen, they are not red. This also applies to those appearing on the back or shoulders. The remedy should include Chenpi (dried tangerine peel), Banxia (pinellia), Fuling (poria), Fangfeng (siler), and Jiuqin (wine-forged forsythia), each a qian (a unit of weight), with Lianqiao (forsythia) two qians, and Zaojiao (soapberry) one and a half qians, along with Chuanxiong (ligusticum) and Cangzhu (atractylodes) each five fen (a smaller unit of weight), and Gancao (licorice) three fen, brewed in water for consumption. </p>
<p>Generally, if there are lumps all over the body, they are often due to phlegm accumulation. In the upper body, they often accompany wind-heat, while in the lower body, they usually accompany damp-heat. It is advisable to add flavors to Xiaowei Decoction and use Zhuli (bamboo juice) to move phlegm, adjusting the dosage according to one&#39;s condition of deficiency or excess; Kelp Pills are also commonly used.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Goiter</strong></p>
<p>Goiter is formed by the combination of phlegm and qi. When tendons and veins are visible, it is called tendon goiter; when there are interwoven red veins, it is blood goiter; when the skin color remains unchanged, it is flesh goiter; when it fluctuates with worries and sorrows, it is qi goiter; and when it is hard and immovable, it is stone goiter. These five names correspond to different types. It relates to the five organs and is treated similarly to tumors. </p>
<p>Its shape resembles a cherry, with one side larger and drooping like a hammer, and the skin is wide and not tight. It arises from worries and troubles, hence it is also called goiter qi; it resembles what is now referred to as a shadow sac. Worries and anger deplete the heart and lungs, so it often appears on the neck and shoulders. Evil qi from exertion takes advantage of the body&#39;s deficiencies to manifest.</p>
<p>It can be either soft or hard, and there is no pain or itchiness. For solid types, use Hai Zao San Jian Wan or Hai Dai Wan; for abundant phlegm and fire, use Shi Zhang San or Shen Xiao Kai Jie San. These are all remedies to transform phlegm, move qi, and break down hardness, and those who have been ill for a long time should not take them rashly.</p>
<p>Common treatments: for those starting out, use Shi Liu Wei Liu Qi Yin or Dan Zhizhu Fang; for those with a longer duration, use La Fan Wan, and regular use will naturally reduce the size. To dissolve it, apply Nan Xing Gao externally. One must not lightly use knives or needles to puncture it, as this would lead to the burst of pus and blood, causing uncontrollable seepage that inevitably leads to death.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Shang Han Liu Shu</strong> [Ming, Tao Hua]</p>
<p><strong>Stiffness of the Neck</strong></p>
<p>Stiffness of the neck and back indicates external evil affecting the Taiyang channel; dispersing it will lead to resolution. If there is chest congestion with neck stiffness, it suggests interior issues. Cold and damp leading to neck stiffness causes cramping. In Taiyang disease, if neck stiffness is accompanied by absence of sweat and aversion to wind, it indicates an excess condition, treated with Ge Gen Tang. If stiffness of the neck and back is present with fever, sweating, and aversion to wind, it suggests a deficiency condition, treated with Gui Zhi Jia Ge Gen Tang. </p>
<p>If the Taiyin has been mistaken for treatment, leading to chest congestion and neck stiffness, use Tai Xian Xiao Wan. For severe cold excess, combine with Si Ni Tang. When there is neck stiffness with fullness under the ribs, body heat, aversion to wind, and sweating in the hands and feet, use Xiao Chai Hu Tang. </p>
<p>When initially afflicted by a Yin toxin presenting with neck stiffness, sore throat, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, reversed flow, vomiting, diarrhea, and a body feeling as though beaten, use Fu Zi Tang, Yin Du Gan Cao Tang, or Zheng Yang Dan. If the seasonal heat reoccurs, leading to evening waist pain, neck stiffness, and body heaviness, use Ge Gen Sheng Jiang Chi Tang.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Case Study on Scrofula</strong><br><strong>By Xue Ji, Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p>Scrofula is a disease associated with the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), liver and gallbladder meridians, characterized by anger, heat, dryness of the blood, or linked to the liver and kidney meridians with depletion of essence and blood, leading to internal heat. It may also arise from excessive anger, anxiety, and overthinking, combined with pathogenic heat and wind that impede the liver. Anger harms the liver, which governs the muscles; when the liver is affected, the muscles become knotted and tense. Symptoms often appear in front of and behind the ears, as well as in the armpits, forming lumps. Initially, there is a dislike of cold and a hatred of heat, with pain in the throat and neck. If there is a cold-heat sensation with pain, this indicates heat in the liver and a related qi condition; for treatment, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction to clear liver heat, along with Jia Wei Si Wu Decoction to nourish liver blood. If the cold and heat have subsided but the lumps persist, it indicates dryness and heat in the liver meridian leading to blood issues; in this case, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San to clear liver heat and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to replenish kidney water.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>If there is swelling that is high and slightly soft, with a pale yellow complexion, hot skin, and pus has formed, one may use a needle to drain it and take a medicinal formula for resolution. If it has not healed after a long time, or if it heals but recurs, with pus flowing freely and the body becoming emaciated, one must use purely restorative medicines to consolidate; otherwise, it may turn into a complex condition like fistulas. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: a sinking pulse is indicative of a fistula, lingering between the flesh layers, which is this disease. Externally apply soybean cakes and amber ointment to dispel cold evils and replenish Yang energy; internally, take the &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction&quot; or Six Flavor Pill to nourish kidney water, strengthen liver wood, and fortify spleen earth, which may also lead to healing. Generally, tuberculosis in the liver and gallbladder, regardless of size, is indicated by a tight pulse at the left guan and a rapid pulse at the left chi, suggesting that kidney water cannot generate liver wood, leading to liver fire drying and muscle cramps. One must use preceding medicines to nourish the source and treat the root of the problem. The &quot;Secret Essentials of the Outer Repository&quot; states: deficiency heat in the liver and kidney can cause sores.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The text &quot;Bing Ji&quot; states: Tuberculosis is not caused by a transformation of hot conditions from rich foods or fire toxins, but rather arises from deficiencies and stagnation of qi. It is appropriate to nourish the body, boost qi, and regulate the meridians, allowing the sores to dissipate naturally; this is achieved not only by sweating them out. If pulse and symptom patterns are not precisely identified, recklessly purging may offend the meridians and lead to disaster—especially if the pulse is strong and large, indicating a deficiency of the original qi, which signifies incurability; if the face is pale, it shows metal restraining wood and also indicates no cure; if there are red veins seen in the eyes, especially several, it suggests imminent death in a few years. To treat without addressing the root causes and arbitrarily using liver-clearing medications is misguided. For clearing the liver can first harm the spleen; if the spleen is damaged, it undermines the source of the five organs, which must be approached with caution. </p>
<p>For a burning and swollen pulse that is deep and rapid, it indicates strong evil qi, and thus, should be drained. If there is swelling and pain with aversion to cold, fever, or rigidity, the evil resides on the surface and should be released. If anger leads to swelling or pain, or fever, it is advisable to soothe the liver and promote qi flow. For swelling, pain, and a floating, rapid pulse, one should dispel wind and clear heat.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>For a weak pulse, focus on nourishing the blood; for a feeble pulse, prioritize energy replenishment; for swollen and hard conditions that do not resolve, center on tonifying both qi and blood. In cases caused by depression, aim to soothe the stagnation and regulate qi and blood. If there is persistent ulceration that does not close, this indicates a deficiency in both qi and blood, warranting a substantial replenishment. If there is a condition where there is a kernel that does not resolve, it should be treated with nourishment and restoration. For a strong pulse that does not resolve or diminish, purgation is necessary. </p>
<p>Zhang states: If a maiden&#39;s menstrual cycle is long overdue, never use cooling agents such as Qinghao. Many practitioners mistakenly think the maiden has excessive heat in the blood, hence employing cooling medicines. Little do they know that heat causes blood to flow, while cold leads to stagnation, as emphasized in &quot;Essential Prescriptions for Health.&quot; This reasoning is very significant and should not be overlooked. </p>
<p>If the menstrual symptoms are slightly present, gradually become obstructed, accompanied by pain in the limbs and bones, gradual emaciation, and the emergence of tidal fevers with a weak and rapid pulse, this denotes yin deficiency and weak blood, allowing yang to prevail. Small water cannot extinguish the overwhelming fire; heat forces water to dry up, leading to the loss of body fluids. One should nourish the blood and enhance yin, and be cautious not to use toxic substances for resolution. The appropriate remedies would be Bai Zi Ren Wan and Ze Lan Wan.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng</strong>  【Ming Dynasty - Wang Kengtang】</p>
<p><strong>Stiffness and Pain in the Neck</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of stiffness and pain in the neck are often caused by external pathogenic factors invading the three Yang meridians. Cold causes the tendons to tighten, while wind allows them to relax; pain on the left side is often related to blood, while pain on the right is usually associated with phlegm. Stiffness and pain in the neck, accompanied by fever and aversion to cold, with a pulse that is floating and tight, indicate that wind and cold are invading the three Yang meridians, and a dispelling evil decoction is advisable.</p>
<p>If the neck is stiff and painful with slight movement, and the pulse is wiry and rapid, with greater severity on the right side, it indicates phlegm heat affecting the three Yang meridians, and a decoction to dissipate wind and resolve phlegm should be used. If stiffness and pain occur with slight movement, and the pulse is wiry and weak, with greater severity on the left side, it indicates blood deficiency and evil affecting the Taiyang and Yangming meridians, warranting a decoction to disperse wind and nourish blood.</p>
<p>If the neck is stiff and there are alternating chills and fever, along with symptoms such as vomiting or pain in the flank, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction or Sheng Ma and Fang Jing Decoction is recommended. For severe stiffness, akin to a feeling of breaking in the waist, add a modified Sheng Shi Decoction. If there is a lack of mental energy or inability to sleep, with swollen and tense neck muscle, avoid sweet and warm foods, and a bitter-cold nourishing the spirit decoction is indicated.</p>
<p>In cases where neck pain is not caused by wind evil, but rather by Qi stagnation, it is also possible for it to result from sleeping improperly, and in such cases, He Qi Decoction should be taken after meals. Many people suffer from trauma, excessive sitting, or improper sleeping position leading to neck stiffness, primarily due to kidney deficiency failing to nourish the liver, resulting in weak liver function unable to support the tendons, which can disrupt the mechanisms of movement; therefore, taking Liu Wei Di Huang Wan regularly is advised.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>Lymphadenitis</p>
<p>The continuous presence of tuberculosis is referred to as lymphadenitis, while projections that resemble elongated clams are known as &quot;horse blades.&quot; Some say that lymphadenitis is indeed a manifestation of tuberculosis. It can occur behind or in front of the ear, or below the ear spanning to the jaw, or below the neck extending to the collarbone; all of these are termed lymphadenitis. It may also appear on the chest and its sides, or in the flanks, and is referred to as horse blades, with the Lesser Yang governing these. According to &quot;Jiyuan,&quot; lymphadenitis sores result from different types of wind poison, heat poison, and qi poison; the lymphadenitis tumors exhibit varied cold and heat symptoms. These conditions arise from excessive anger and emotional distress, with wind and heat evils attacking the liver. Anger harms the liver, which governs the tendons, causing them to contract, accumulate, and swell. The symptoms often manifest between the neck, chest, and flanks, forming clusters that initially resemble bean-sized lumps and later grow to look like plums or dates, interconnected in varying sizes.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>When you first feel a dislike for cold and a strong heat, with pain in the throat and swelling that does not subside, you should take a decoction for dispersing swelling and softening hardness, or similar remedies like Five-Spice Lianqiao and Leoru Decoction. You can also use Oysters and Dahuang Decoction to promote bowel movements and relieve symptoms. For sores, you may apply a blend like Ten-Fragrance Ointment, along with various washing and topical treatments to help dissipate the condition. If it does not improve, internal remedies like消内丸 should be used, or moxibustion with garlic can be employed. One should also avoid breathing deeply and consume light, easy-to-digest foods for recovery. Otherwise, fear arises that over time, it may develop into cold and heat cough and lead to a condition like tuberculosis, which would be difficult to treat. </p>
<p>Additionally, there are horse knife sores, which arise between the neck and armpits resembling scrofula. Initially, they appear like a horse knife, red and fiery, causing extreme burning pain. These sores are very severe and should be treated urgently; otherwise, they may become life-threatening. Differentiate and diagnose correctly in such acute cases.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>For the treatment regimen, if a patient initially experiences chills, intense heat, strong pain in the throat and neck, with swelling that does not subside, use the Qianghuo Lianqiao Decoction. Additionally, regular consumption of the Xiaoyao Wan (Happy Wanderer Pill) is advisable. Furthermore, puncture the area with a needle to draw out blood; use the Baodu Decoction for hot washes, five to seven times a day. Perform needling five to seven times as well, placing a small amount of toad venom powder at the needle site and covering it with amber balm. Over time, this will lead to natural resolution. If it does not recede, use an iron tube to apply the detox ointment, then remove necrotic tissue with a lower-grade medicinal pellet, which can be used for ulcer treatment. Apply ten xuan powder or similar substances for this. If toxins attack the heart causing vomiting, use powdered milk and detoxifying powders. This should be paired with acupuncture methods. If there is an ulcer that does not heal, the Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction or Ba Shi Wu Decoction with additional Chai Hu, Di Gu Pi, Xia Ku Cao, Fu Zi, and Bei Mu should be taken frequently for efficacy. Whenever using pellet medicines, it is crucial to take along the detoxifying agents. </p>
<p>For redness, swelling, and pain with a deep, rapid pulse, it indicates substantial pathogenic influence; thus, it should be expelled to transform toxins, reduce swelling, harmonize the interior, and adjust accordingly. If there is swelling, pain, chills, heat, or tension with a floating, rapid pulse, it indicates the evil is at the surface; therefore, disperse the exterior using Jing Fang Bai Du with adjustments. If swelling, pain, or fever arises from anger, promote liver qi and alleviate stagnation using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Qing Pi, Qing Mu Xiang, Hong Hua, and Tao Ren added. If the swelling is hard and unulcerated, tonify qi and blood with Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction. If it stems from repression, resolve stagnation and regulate qi and blood with Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>After a rupture that does not close, it indicates both qi and blood are deficient. It is advisable to nourish with a great restorative formula, using Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction, followed by Ten Complete Major Restorative Decoction with added Cyperus and Fritillaria, as well as Polygala. For cases caused by deficiency and overstrain, it is necessary to support first with the Supplement Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction, then follow with Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction with adjustments. When there is a rupture that does not heal, due to decay combined with the need for nourishment, use a needle to treat the decay and supplement with the Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction. If the pulse is strong and does not close or resolve, treat with Qianghuo Lianqiao Decoction. For swelling and pain accompanied by chills and fever and constipation, use Qianghuo Lianqiao Decoction, followed by the Divine Immortal Life-Saving Drink. For submandibular swollen and painful lymph nodes with chills and fever, use Jingfang Baituo Powder; once the exterior condition subsides, use the Swelling Dispersal and Hardening Dissolution Decoction. If after a rupture the mass does not decay, apply the Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction, while also using the needle to disperse the decay. If the swelling is hard and long-lasting without suppuration, and not responding to dispersing hardening Baituo medicine, it is advisable to moxibust the tip of the elbow and shoulder, while taking the Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction for resolution. For those with robust qi and blood, if the pulse is deep, full, and large without feeling diminished, one can take Biuxiao San and Wuxian Wubi Pill to eliminate toxins. If the toxin responds, stop these two medicines and continue with the Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction for regulation. If the wound edges do not close, it is appropriate to apply a bean curd cake for moxibustion and use amber ointment and Ten Fragrance Ointment as a dressing. If there is fever after needling, restlessness, and thirst with a large and weak pulse, it indicates blood deficiency; one should use the Danggui Blood Nourishment Decoction, then follow with Shengyu Decoction, and additionally Bawei Decoction with Fritillaria and Polygala. For those overexerted mentally, presenting heat and swelling in the neck, if toxin treatments worsen the condition, it is necessary to take several doses of Supplement Middle and Benefit Qi to resolve the issue.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Bai Mai Ju (Hundred Pulses Abscess)</strong></p>

This indicates a great fear and anxiety, with a rising Qi causing cough. The swelling extends to the ears; it should not be punctured. One can perform needling or manipulation after fifteen days. If needling or manipulation results in blood, death is certain within eighty days.</p>
<p><strong>Neck Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: What to do when an abscess forms on the neck? The answer: This is a neck abscess, resulting from the accumulated heat and anger in the hand Shaoyang Sanjiao channel. As soon as one feels it, use garlic for moxibustion and take &quot;Huo Ming Yin&quot; with added Yuan Shen, Jie Geng, Sheng Ma, as well as &quot;Sheng Jin Dan&quot; and &quot;Duo Ming Dan&quot; for sweating. For robust individuals, a pill of Jin Dan can be taken; for the elderly and weak, use &quot;Shi Quan Da Bu Tang&quot; or &quot;Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang.&quot; If it bursts and does not heal, with agitation, bloating, and urination resembling dripping, accompanied by vomiting, it will lead to death.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Abscess of the Neck</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: What about an abscess that forms under the back of the neck? The answer: This is known as a “mouth sore,” and it is associated with the Governor Vessel. When Yang is overly abundant, and the Qi is excessive, the fire rises and causes the abscess to form. One should urgently take Wujin San and Shengjindan for sweating; for those who are robust, one pellet of Jindan should be taken. If delayed, pus will flow out; if it leads to convulsions due to wind, it is difficult to treat. If there is toxic evil blocking with violent surges of fresh blood, it can lead to death. If the poison attacks the heart and abdomen, causing bloating and delirium, it also results in death. This condition, with red, swollen pain, can be treated; however, if the root is large and spirit is confused, it is difficult to cure. Assess the balance of deficiency and excess to induce sweating and down regulate internally, while using external powerful medicaments to contain it; apply medicinal paste like Liu Huai Gao to break and drain the poison, ensuring the root is not lost. If it spreads to the shoulders and back, do not treat. Some suggest first taking the Pursuing Sore and Life-Depriving Decoction for two applications, followed by the Blood-Activating and Toxic-Cleansing Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Tianzhu Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Some asked: What about an abscess on the Tianzhu bone, causing extreme itchiness to the bone, with nausea and vomiting, and tightness in the shoulders and back? The answer: This is called Tianzhu abscess. Urgently apply garlic moxibustion to relieve the itch; if garlic is unavailable, bright moxibustion can also treat it. Take Lifesaving Decoction with Qiang Huo and Jie Geng added. Select suitable Wujin San and Shengjindan. If blisters form after moxibustion, it is auspicious; if no blisters form, it is ominous. If sweating is achieved with a sweating remedy, it can be treated; without sweating, it is difficult to treat. If it becomes rotten with confusion, nausea, vomiting, and continuous bleeding, it leads to death.</p>
<p><strong>Zhu Abscess</strong><a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Someone asked: What about the abscess that forms behind the ears on the neck?

Gradually it grows larger, resembling the spots on a tortoise shell; it is also known as &quot;Transforming Bone Ulcer.&quot; One should urgently take &quot;Eight Formation Powder,&quot; &quot;Life-Saving Elixir,&quot; and &quot;Vitality Drink&quot; with added Platycodon and Bupleurum. If it becomes ulcerated past the appropriate time and exposes bone over time, it is a serious sign. This condition often arises in people with accumulated depression, and it is most common in those with seven evils present; those who have broken prohibitions will not recover. </p>
<p><strong>Surgical Authenticity</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong]</p>
<p><strong>On Brain Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Brain abscesses are commonly referred to as &quot;Dui Kou.&quot; However, their manifestations differ, having two sources. If acquired from a combination of dampness and heat, through external invasion, it is lighter; if arising from internal organ stagnation that manifests externally, it is more severe. Why is this? The illness of dampness and heat arises from the climate, where cold and heat are not balanced, seasonal temperature changes are irregular, and yin and yang are out of harmony. Those with a weak constitution are easily invaded. Although the area behind the neck belongs to the Governor Vessel, it also governs the pathway of solar cold and water; all invasions cause qi and blood to stagnate, and stagnation leads to swelling. This is the case when acquired externally. When the illness first arises, there is pain at the onset, often appearing at critical points, with rapid heat and pain in the first few days, sometimes accompanied by chills and fever. The mouth feels dry yet is not parched, the color is red with active roots, the ulcer raises gradually in severity, the shape is not diffuse or large, the pain comes and goes, and it is prone to pus and corruption. The ability to taste food remains, and there are no significant changes in appetite or activity. Although the external symptoms may seem fearsome, if there are no signs of the seven evils, this belongs to yang conditions, and since it arises from external sources, it often can resolve without treatment.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>All the internal organs that accumulate and become heavy have five sources: First, the heart governs blood, so when the heart is disturbed, it leads to restlessness and excessive heat, causing swelling as it interacts with cold water in the neck. Second, the liver regulates the tendons, and when anger injures the liver, it affects the blood vessels, resulting in a lack of nourishment for the tendons, which can lead to swelling. If the problem is not resolved, the skin may show a dark purple color, and it may feel hard and swollen. If it ruptures, blood and foul water may flow without pain or pus, indicating liver qi injury. Third, the spleen governs the muscles, so worries harm the spleen. As spleen qi declines or if rich foods affect the stomach, this can result in stagnation in the middle jiao, preventing qi from circulating and leading to swelling, where the outer skin may appear rotten but the inside remains hard and unruptured, accompanied by dry mouth and tongue, inability to eat, and foul discharge. These signs indicate spleen qi injury.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>The lungs govern the skin and hair, thus melancholy harms the lungs. When the lungs are injured, the pores close, the channels become obstructed, and the qi cannot flow smoothly. Stagnation throughout the meridians leads to swelling, with ulcers often appearing flat and depressed, having a pale and unremarkable color. The skin may become rotten and greasy like spilled soup, breathing becomes coarse and short, the face appears dull and the nose congested, leading to excessive phlegm and persistent coughing. These symptoms all indicate injury to lung qi.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bones and marrow, thus excessive desires harm the kidneys. When the kidneys are injured, the true yin energy becomes depleted. Once the true yin fails, the fire of true yang arises on its own, which can fluctuate up and down, in motion or stillness, causing distress to the internal organs, consuming the body fluids, altering appearance and voice. The ulcers have a purple-black coloration, with a rapid and irregular pulse, restlessness and dry mouth, leading to thirst with drinking. These symptoms all indicate injury to kidney qi.</p>
<p>In treating these conditions, one must first distinguish between deficiency and excess internally, and between yin and yang externally. One must align with seasonal changes, observing the pathology. If a sore has not yet formed after seven days, the channels should be opened to induce sweating. If seven days have passed and the condition has established itself, treatment must include both supplementation and drainage. This approach prevents internal toxicity and external transformation of symptoms.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>If the medicinal attack on the excess of pathogens is too intense, the vital energy will be harmed, and the toxins will be difficult to eliminate. If one applies cooling medicines, the qi and blood freeze and凝凝, causing the flesh to die and becoming difficult to ulcerate. I have treated this condition, as well as early-stage back eruptions, by inserting a bamboo needle at the apex directly into the painful spot to expel the foul blood, opening the wound channels, and then inserting toad venom sticks until reaching the bottom of the sore, covering with medicated ointment externally. Internally, I prescribe the Universal Elixir or toad venom pills to induce profuse sweating and dissipate the internal toxins. The next day, the swelling might subside, with or without pain; continue the insertion and application until the swelling rises and a root-like protrusion appears with surrounding cracks filled with pus, at which point stop the needle insertion. For mild cases, after nine days, the hardened disease root will be expelled. In cases of severe toxicity where it cannot fall off immediately, it may gradually rot into pus, a good method for converting the severe into the mild. Use the Jade Red Ointment externally to help with flesh growth and internally take supplements to consolidate and contain; the issue will likely heal on its own soon. For light and shallow Yang conditions, wait for natural ulceration without the use of needle techniques. If it is painless and not swollen, even if moxibustion is applied without discomfort, this indicates a Yin condition, which should be addressed swiftly without delay; this is an important method for resolving deep-rooted issues that manifest superficially.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Initially, if the top is high, the root is alive, the color is red, the skin is thin, and there is pain, heat, and swelling that does not disperse, it is favorable. Once it has formed, regardless of whether it is improper or proper, if the sore appears elevated, is painful, hot, and prone to pus and decay, it is favorable. After it has ulcerated, if the pus is thick, the flesh is red and alive, bruises are easy to detach, swelling gradually decreases, and pain diminishes, it is favorable. Following ulceration, if decay has separated, new flesh begins to grow, the sore gradually closes, scabs form, and there is itching, it is favorable. </p>
<p>If initially a small yellow blister appears, resembling a bump, it does not swell or hurt, and the person is unaware, it is unfavorable. Once it has formed, if it does not swell high or hurt, with the top of the sore soft and sunken, and the base flat and dispersed, it is unfavorable. After it has ulcerated, if the pus is clear, the flesh is purple-black, the outer skin is not decayed, but there is a foul smell emanating from within, and it does not heal, it is unfavorable. Even if the rotten flesh is completely gone, if new flesh does not grow, the sore widens, softens, lacks vitality, and its color fades, it is unfavorable. </p>
<p>Treatment methods.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>At the onset, whether there is a head or not, whether there is great pain or not, it should be treated with garlic moxibustion, along with detoxification herbs. If it has formed, is hard and hot, and causes pain, with dry mouth and constipation, it indicates internal evil and should be purged. If it is hard and swollen, without pain, accompanied by fever and chills, and headaches with stiff limbs, both expelling and purging methods should be used. If the swelling becomes deeper and the color appears purple-black, with intact outer skin and no internal pus discharge, the method of extraction should be employed. If the swelling is strong, with a hot face, dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting, it indicates that the evil is above and should be cleared. If it is hot, swollen, and painful, with a bright red color, periodically painful, and internal pus causing swelling and pain, it should be urgently opened up. If it is about to ulcerate but remains slightly warm and slightly red without forming a decay, it indicates spleen and stomach deficiency and should be nourished. After ulceration, if the necrotic flesh does not fall off, with clear and thin pus, and the swelling and pain continues, one should greatly nourish qi and blood. If there is frequent diarrhea, concentrated and scanty urine, spontaneous sweating, little appetite, with a thin pulse and cool body, warmth should be applied to strengthen the spleen.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Scrofula</strong></p>

Wind poison arises from exposure to wind and cold, binding in the meridians, where the condition first presents with cold followed by heat, resulting in swollen nodules. Heat poison occurs in excessively hot weather, during the height of summer, or from consuming rich foods, leading to red and slightly warm colors with firm, swollen nodules. Qi poison develops from the harshness of seasonal changes, resulting in sudden swelling in areas such as the ears, neck, chest, and armpits, causing chills, fever, dizziness, and pain in the neck. Scrofula appears clustered like strings of pearls, with connections of three to five lumps.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>Cold and heat derive from consuming unclean remnants left by insects, ants, and mice, or from sweat mixed with old tea and stale water. The affliction starts small and gradually becomes serious; initially, there is no pain, but over time it becomes noticeable. </p>
<p>Muscle knots, or &quot;Jin Li,&quot; arise from sorrowful thoughts and explosive anger, which harm the liver. Since the liver governs the muscles, it causes them to contract, forming hard knots that appear between the neck and muscles, resembling the hardness of chess pieces, varying in size, some recessed and others protruding. Over time, they can become hollow and produce both cold and heat; excessive labor and anger worsen the condition.</p>
<p>Phlegm knots arise from improper regulation of food and drink, instability in hunger and satiety, and fluctuating emotions, leading to an inability of the spleen to transport and transform, resulting in phlegm accumulation. Initially, it resembles small plums or cherries on the body, turning slightly red over time, and eventually rupturing, which makes it easier to contain.</p>
<p>In observing these symptoms, one should identify the wind and toxin; to disperse the wind and eliminate the toxin, remedies like &quot;Fang Feng Jie Du Tang&quot; are effective. For heat toxin, it is necessary to cleanse the spleen and drain the heat, using formulas such as &quot;Lian Qiao Xiao Du Yin.&quot;<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>For those with toxic Qi, regulate their blood and harmonize their Qi, using formulas like Huoxiang Zhengqi San. For scrofula, disperse the hardness and harmonize the blood, employing formulas like San Juan Guo Jian Tang. For muscle and tendon issues, clear the liver and relieve stagnation with formulas like Chai Hu Qing Gan Tang. For phlegm-related issues, expel phlegm and move Qi, using formulas like Qin Lian Er Chen Tang. Additionally, there are widowed nuns, widowers, and secondary wives, whose aspirations remain unfulfilled, and thoughts accumulate in their hearts, which can overly exhaust their essence and energy, often creating difficult-to-treat conditions. In such cases, first nourish the heart and blood, then relieve stagnation, benefit the kidneys, calm the spirit, and soothe the liver and diaphragm, utilizing formulas like Gui Pi Tang and Yi Qi Yang Rong Tang, adding ingredients like Xiang Fu, Qing Pi, Shan Zhi Shi, Bei Mu, and Mu Xiang.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>Men should avoid symptoms like blue veins on the forehead, hot flashes with cough, and excessive sweating. Women should avoid having red threads in the eyes, irregular menstruation, and a feeling of heat in the bones, along with restlessness in their hearts. If either men or women experience these symptoms, they may later develop difficult-to-treat tuberculosis. However, those with sufficient vitality in the early stages may take herbs to disperse swelling and soften nodules; about 30-40% may find relief. If one is not aware of their condition and uses strong doses recklessly, it may damage vital energy, leading to severe illnesses—this is often not the patient&#39;s fate but rather results from the actions of the physician. I often treat early-stage nodules; if previous medications are ineffective, I use needles to pierce the nodule deeply, inserting a thin strip of ice powder and sealing it with paper. After approximately 14 days, the nodule will naturally fall out, and applying red and black plasters along with internal tonics usually leads to recovery in no time. I have also frequently observed that using substances like rashes, morning glories, and certain purgative herbs has often led to severe outcomes; thus, one should exercise caution with them.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>At the outset, if the tumor is swollen and painful, red and soft, with slight chills and fever, and the shoulder and neck are not stiff, it is easy to treat. Once formed, if the root is not hard, there are no small clusters inside, and the spleen is healthy with no loss of energy or blood, it is also easy to treat. If it has ulcerated, with thick pus, red and moist flesh, the tumor gradually shrinking, and the shoulder and neck easing over time, it is favorable. After ulceration, if it is easy to resolve and contract, with a calm energy, broad chest and smooth digestion, and a good appetite, it is favorable. If not formed, with a thin physique, alternating chills and fever, stubborn hard lumps, and accompanying cough with phlegm, it is dangerous. If formed, with hard lumps that feel connected like beads, of varying sizes, stiff neck and tense muscles, and weak pulse, it is dangerous. If it has ulcerated, with clear and thin pus, muscle wasting, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, and persistent chills and fever, it is adverse. After ulceration, if there are symptoms of yin deficiency with irritability, thirst, constipation, bone steaming in men, and menstrual irregularities in women, it is also adverse.</p>
<p>Treatment methods.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>When the initial symptoms are swelling and pain, with aversion to cold and strong heat, limbs feeling tense, stiff neck, and dizziness, it is advisable to disperse these symptoms. For hard swelling with heat, constipation, dry mouth, uncomfortable feeling in the chest, nausea, and a strong pulse, one should promote bowel movements. Accumulated heat from rich foods and strong wines, as well as damp phlegm leading to stagnation, should be transformed to clear heat and resolve phlegm. Overthinking and excessive worry harm the liver, causing retraction and knots, so nourishing blood and releasing stagnant emotions is advised. If there is exhaustion from sexual activity, Yin deficiency with evening heat, spontaneous sweating, coughing, and emaciation, one should nourish the kidneys and strengthen the spleen. Those who feel lost and forgetful, with pent-up emotions and obsessive thoughts, find themselves separated from yin and yang, suffering from the passage of time, will injure both essence and blood. First, nourish the righteous Qi, then treat the superficial condition. Firm yet not collapsing, decayed yet not rotting; rotting yet not healing, supplement and heal it. These are all methods of revitalization.</p>

Chaihu works similarly to Lianqiao; if the sore is not located in the Shaoyang channels, do not use it. Three parts of Mouchanzizi; do not use if there is no swelling. Two parts of Jing Sanling Pao. Two parts of Kunbu, which has a salty flavor; if the sore is very hard, use this, as salt can soften hard issues. Three parts of Xuan; these two ingredients are for very hard sores; do not use if not hard. One qian each of Qianghuo, Duhuo, and Fangfeng; these three must address the hand and foot Taiyang symptoms, spine pain, and stiffness in the neck, where one cannot look back, and the waist feels like it&#39;s broken and the neck feels like it&#39;s pulled.

Two parts of Shenqu, fried, for those with undigested food. Two parts of Yizhiren; if there is excessive salivation, it indicates stomach disharmony or vomiting saliva and food; if there is cold in the stomach, add this; if not, do not use. One qian of Malt, for digestion and strengthening the spleen. Three parts of Huangbo, fried; if there is heat or weakness in the legs, add this. If one feels restless and wants to remove their clothes, this indicates concealed fire in the stomach, so it’s advisable to add this. Three parts of Huanglian, fried; it treats irritability. One qian and two parts of Houpu, processed with ginger; if there is abdominal distension, add this.</li>

If the patient’s qi is typically weak but the illness manifests with strong qi that is not short and quick, then treat it as strong qi while following the changes of the illness.

If there is constipation and an excess of pathogenic factors, add wine-prepared Dahuang to promote bowel movement. If there is dryness of blood and hard stools, add peach kernel paste and Dahuang. If there is wind causing dryness and blockages, add hemp seed and Dahuang to moisten. If there is wind with hot conditions causing constipation, add roasted soapberry kernel, Dahuang, and Qinjiao to promote bowel movement. If the pulse is thin and one feels sluggish and has constipation, add (Mu Yu) Li kernel and Dahuang to dispel wind and dryness. If there is a cold yin condition resulting in a cold obstruction and constipation, use the prescribed formula with half a mercury pill, or add roasted Aconite and dried ginger in decoction, waiting until cool to take. Generally, in the method of using medicine, not only for sores but for all diseases with weak qi, one should reduce bitter and cold medicinals and increase ginseng, Huangqi, and licorice to drain fire and replenish primal qi; the rest should follow this principle.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br><strong>Chai Hu Tong Jing Decoction</strong>: Treats sores on the sides of a child’s neck, hardened and unbroken, known as &quot;horse knife,&quot; and also treats scrofula.

<li>2.5 qian of southern borax</li>
<li>1 qian of talcum powder</li>
<li>5 seeds of croton (remove the heart and membrane)</li>
<li>1 areca nut</li>
<li>14 Chinese pill bugs (remove feet and wings, fry with glutinous rice)</li>

<p>All these should be ground into a very fine powder. Take two eggs, remove the yolk, and mix with the medicinal powder using clear water, then put it back into the shells. Cover the openings with damp paper multiple times and steam until cooked. Afterward, dry and grind into powder. For those with a deficiency, take 0.5 qian per dose; for those with a surplus, take 1 qian, mixed with ginger wine at the fifth watch (around 4-5 AM).

Remove and let cool to powder. Use glutinous rice paste to make a thread and dry it in the shade. Depending on the size and depth of the wound, cut it accordingly. First, use an iron tube to break the detoxifying ointment, then insert the medicine thread into the wound and apply the ointment. When the medicine thread has dissolved, it needs to be replaced three to four times, and for deeper wounds, five to six times, until it decays and ulcerates. For wounds exposed to the outside, also use honey water to apply, and it can be dried if wet.</p>

First, apply the iron jar ointment on the sore to darken it; next, apply these pills, and place a medicated patch over it, changing the medicine every three days. If any rotten flesh remains, you can use the lower-grade pills and needle-head powder to remove the decayed flesh completely. For any remaining pus, use a powder to promote flesh growth and dry the pus at the wound; apply a medicated patch over it.

<p>Another formula treats nodules located on the Shaoyang channel behind the neck, regardless of color or size, and whether there is deep pain or swelling that is red and hard. Take a piece of fresh yam and peel it, along with one seed of castor bean. Grind them together evenly, apply it as a poultice, and it will work wonders. Danxi says: Yam nourishes Yang qi, and the fresh form can reduce swelling and hardness. The classics say: Where there is deficiency, evil must gather; if it remains, it becomes substantial.

Then, add yellow lead until it turns a faint reddish color, sealing the pot tightly and letting it cool. The next day, the thick substance in the clay pot should be stored with the opening sealed tightly. Use a small amount for applying on top of the affected area, immediately piercing through. If it does not blacken, apply again, aiming for a blackened appearance. If the medicine is dry, mix it with saliva for application. If urgent, simply use nine bowls of large firewood ash and three bowls of lime, prepare the ash juice as before and boil it down to a thick consistency.

If activated, it causes throat pain and swelling of the jaw, making it difficult to look around; shoulder feels like being pulled, upper arm feels like being broken. This meridian governs diseases generated from fluids, leading to deafness, jaundice, cheek swelling, and pain in the neck, jaw, shoulder, upper arm, elbow, and outer back, influenced by excess or deficiency, heat or cold. </p>

<p>The &quot;Complete Book of Ulcers&quot; states: For men, women, and children suffering from lumps, applying the rules of four and six incinerations will prove effective. The area at the end of the shoulder blade is the location for the two shoulder well points; cauterize the left shoulder on the left and the right shoulder on the right, and if both are present, cauterize both.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br>The mouse tail point is located at one hole, using a single stalk of grass. For men, it corresponds to the horizontal line on the middle segment of the left hand, and for women, it corresponds to the right hand. Measure beyond the four finger widths to the end, and compare it to where it bends and breaks near the tip of the spiral bone, relating to the tendons at the back of the foot; this is the mouse tail point. If you perform moxibustion on the left side, do so on the left side, and on the right side, do so on the right side; both should be treated at the same time, five treatments a year, and more moxibustion as the year progresses. It specifically treats all types of scrofula and requires abstention from sexual activity. The effectiveness is truly miraculous and can save lives. After moxibustion, if there are sores, crush plantain leaves and apply them. Be aware of any prohibitions for the person and choose auspicious days based on celestial healers.</p>
<p>Prohibitions after moxibustion: after performing moxibustion, avoid all fish, hot foods, raw wine, cold items, fresh meat, and excessive labor. </p>
<p>Additionally, perform moxibustion on the area between the two tendons on the back of each hand, seven treatments each, measuring from the horizontal line of the middle finger to the tip of the respective finger for four inches. Then perform moxibustion at the elbow tip; if the left is affected, treat the right elbow, and if the right is affected, treat the left elbow, each with three treatments, but no more than three times for complete elimination. </p>
<p>For treating scrofula, whether it has formed or not, whether it has burst or not, place your hand on the shoulder and raise it slightly so that the elbow bone tip appears; this indicates the site for moxibustion. If the left is affected, moxibustion should be done on the left elbow, if the right is affected then the right elbow should be treated; both elbows should be treated with three or four treatments. Additionally, take supplements; for those who have been treated for a year, moxibustion should be done once daily, and after three treatments, the sores will heal on their own.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>If afflicted for three to four years without improvement, burn moxa from the hour of Chen until the hour of You, stopping only after three sessions, which will lead to healing. Additionally, take a nourishing tonic.</p>
<p>Another method: for those not yet forming pus, use garlic sliced to about two coins thick, place it on the affected area, and burn moxa on top of the garlic. After three to five applications, replace the garlic, and perform this daily on ten or more garlic slices to draw out toxic stagnation. If it has broken and not healed, and there are nodules or bruised flesh inside, this is due to insufficient qi and blood preventing decay. Use Jiangxi fermented black soybeans as powder, mix it with saliva to form a paste, and apply moxibustion as before to support yang energy. Internally take tonics and externally apply a golden silken ointment, allowing the wound to heal on its own.</p>
<p>The &quot;Ten Treatises of Dongyuan&quot; states: if there is swelling under the armpit, with a knife-like swelling, and the patient can bite their tongue and cheek, with swelling in the Tian You area, and alternating cold and heat, take one part each of Lin Qi and Qiu Xu and perform five moxa applications; for Tai Chong, take one part and perform three applications.</p>
<p>For swelling under the armpit and neck, take three parts of Tian Chi and moxibust for seven applications; if there is swelling in the jaw, add two parts of Hou Xi and moxibust for five applications.</p>
<p>For swelling under the armpit combined with a knife-like swelling and throat obstruction, take five parts of Yang Fu and moxibust for fourteen applications; for Shen Mai, take one part and moxibust for three applications, leading to immediate healing.</p>
<p>For all types of goitre causing foul qi, moxibust the shoulder&#39;s Yu point, with males receiving eighteen applications on the left and seventeen on the right, while females receive eighteen on the right and seventeen on the left. Locate the moxibustion point between the protuberance of the shoulder bone and its depressions, lifting the arm to find it.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br>Another method: Moxibustion at the Tianfu point seven times, and on the Chongyang point as needed each year. &quot;Danxi Xinfa&quot; states: For moxibustion of scrofula, pound the root of the Shanglu plant into a cake, place it on the scrofula, then moxibust the cake with moxa until dried, replacing it as needed, and moxibust three to four cakes. &quot;Dexiao Fang&quot; states: For treating scrofula, place your hand above the shoulder, slightly raise the hand to access it; the acupoint is the tip of the elbow bone. Moxibust seven times or two sets of seven times as needed on the affected area for immediate effect. &quot;Yixue Gangmu&quot; states: There are two approaches for needling and moxibustion for neck pain. The first involves the hand and foot Taiyang channels, treating pain at the back of the neck. The text states that the Taiyang pathway can cause neck pain as if being pulled when in motion; assess for excess or deficiency, cold or heat. It further states that for neck pain, do not needle the foot Taiyang when bending forward or looking up, nor the hand Taiyang when turning around. It also indicates that for wind-related neck pain, needle Fengfu, located on the upper vertebra. It adds that if pathogenic factors affect the foot Taiyang network, it can cause pain in the head, neck, and shoulders; needle the area at the junction of the smallest toe&#39;s nail and flesh. If pain persists, needle three points below the outer ankle, alternating sides as if to eat. The second approach involves the foot and hand Yangming channels, treating pain at the front of the neck. The text states that the foot Yangming pathway relates to neck swelling, while the hand Yangming can cause neck swelling with movement; both require assessment of excess or deficiency, cold or heat conditions.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Secret Scriptures of the Stone Chamber&quot; says: If the neck and shoulders are stiff, it is due to wind. One person should hold the lower body while another shakes it with a fist until it has been done several thousand times. Then, press deeply on the acupoint known as the wind gate; after a while, the soreness and pain will cease. The patient will then sit up and swallow saliva gently towards the lower dantian seven times before stopping, and recovery will occur within a day.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essential Secrets of Preserving Life&quot; states: For the treatment of scrofula through guidance, use the hand on the shoulder well (Jing) acupoint, squeezing at sixty-four degrees. Rubbing should also be performed in a similar fashion; the technique is extremely effective. The practice starts at returning to the source, gradually leading to the affected area. Focus is placed on applying rotation, from small to large, penetrating and dispersing, dispersing and guiding, leading to the chest, circling several times, and then rotating back to the affected area. This method is practiced repeatedly, around several dozen times to disperse the lump. Deliver poison once daily, entering from the stomach and curving into the large intestine, then expelling through the food passage, removing the impure and retaining the pure. Caution is advised in maintaining the original yang, and one must avoid anger and irritability. The above method should be performed seven times in a day and night, and it will naturally dissipate without a trace.</p>
<p>Additionally: Visualize a tendon at the affected spot. Use the left hand on the right side and the right hand on the left side, pulling it down into the abdomen. If the scrofula causes pain, then pull it down from the soles of the feet.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The text from &quot;Ben Shi Fang&quot; states: A person suffers from stiff neck muscles, unable to turn or tilt the head, starting in the afternoon and settling by dusk. I said: This ailment must originate from the feet, as the muscles of the solar channel extend from the feet to the neck. Generally, the muscles are associated with the liver; from noon to dusk, it is the time of yang, and within yang, there is yin. Furthermore, within yin, there is yang, which pertains to the lungs. From Li to Dui, it is a time when yin is abundant and yang is weak, thus &quot;Ling Bao Bi Fa&quot; states: From Li to Gan, the kidney energy is exhausted while the liver energy is weak. Both the liver and kidney organs are affected by yin energy, hence the onset occurs at this time. I prescribed a brew of papaya, and after three doses, the patient recovered.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>A person suffering from pain in the neck and back, unable to move, found no relief from various wind medicines. I recalled a case in &quot;Thousand Gold Essence&quot; regarding kidney energy attacking the back, which was treated with a dose of Pepper and Deer Antler Powder, yielding some effect. It appears that the kidney energy, originating from the waist, travels up the spine to the Cao Xi point, and then enters the Mijing Palace. The Cao Xi point cannot be penetrated unless one is skilled in manipulation. Since it is stuck and cannot continue along this path, using pepper to guide it back into the channels will bring relief. The energy ascends and is countered by the downward action of the pepper, thus taking it results in healing.</p>
<p>In &quot;The Confucian Way of Serving Parents,&quot; it is recorded that a man named Dai was staying with the official in the West Hua area when suddenly a sore appeared on his neck, resembling a whitehead, with a swollen, hard red base. He initially disregarded it due to its small size. Unexpectedly, he encountered an old friend who invited him to drink sheep fat wine along with chicken, fish, salt, and garlic. Dai, unable to refuse due to their friendship and forgetting his dietary restrictions, found that night unbearable due to the pain from the sore, which swelled to his head, causing him to speak irrationally and see ghosts and spirits. The official, Xia, was extremely alarmed and wanted to report it to Dai&#39;s family. Dai laughed and said, “Please don’t worry; tomorrow it will be fine.” He then mixed wine with Tongjing Powder, taking six or seven qian, along with more than a hundred pills of boat and vehicle essence, and followed this with a hot flour soup. This triggered a strong reaction, both upward and downward, resulting in a large release, filling half a basin. By noon the next day, the swelling of the sore had subsided, and in one or two days, it completely healed. Xia was greatly astonished by this outcome.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>A woman fell ill with scrofula, which spread to her chest and formed large sores, leaving no healthy flesh. She sought the help of a healer. The healer said: &quot;This is caused by excessive fire; treat it with something cool and salty.&quot; He instructed her to take long salt to induce vomiting, and after one vomit, her sores began to form scabs. Subsequently, he used cool decoctions and detoxifying soups, and her flesh gradually returned to normal.</p>
<p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A man had a stiff neck and could not turn his head; movement caused slight pain, and his pulse was tight and rapid. His right side was worse. For phlegm obstructing the sun meridian, he used Erchen Decoction with wine to wash Huangqin, Qianghuo, and Honghua, and after taking it for two days, he was cured.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Records&quot; notes: A scholar, Yang Zezhi, had a restless nature and a craving for lust, resulting in a testicular growth. This was due to liver fire and blood dryness causing muscle spasms. The treatment should nourish kidney water to generate liver blood. Disbelieving this, he took internal medicines to reduce fire and resolve phlegm, applying Nanshen and Shanglu externally, which caused it to swell as large as a bowl. I used remedies to tonify the middle and benefit Qi, along with Liuwei Dihuang, interspersed with Aloe pills, and after a year, his vital energy was restored and the swelling disappeared.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>A man who was naturally prone to anger had a slight swelling on his left neck, which gradually grew larger like a gourd. He experienced excessive thirst due to great heat, and his urine was frequently turbid. I judged this to be a deficiency of kidney water and prescribed Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for recovery. There were also lumps in his chest and sides, as large as a measuring cup; some broke open like fungus or pomegranate, regardless of size, all were treated with the previous method.</p>
<p>A scholar named Jiang Jie had knots on his neck, arms, and ribs, and strictly took medicines to eliminate phlegm, reduce fire, and soften hardness, but to no avail. I said: This is a deficiency of liver and gallbladder blood, leading to dryness and heat. He persisted with the previous medicines, and by June of the following year, all knots had ruptured, with a pulse that was floating and large. I concluded that autumn&#39;s metal would become strong, while the liver&#39;s wood was being restrained, leading to no improvement. Eventually, this prediction came true.</p>
<p>The son of the old minister Yang Shizhai, aged seventeen, suffered from tuberculosis, experiencing fever and thirst, with red cheeks in the afternoon and a large, floating pulse at the left wrist. This indicated a deficiency of liver and kidney yin. I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang for more than twenty doses, adding Ren Shen and Huang Qi for over twenty more doses, but it just ruptured. However, the pus was clear and watery, with no muscle growth. Thus, I focused on Ren Shen, Huang Qi, Bai Zhu, and combined them with Shao Yao, Shu Di, Mai Dong, and Wu Wei, which made the pus thicker and facilitated muscle growth. I then prescribed another effective remedy, which cleared the tuberculosis poison and helped the sores to close.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>A Confucian scholar, after recovering from an illness, experienced weakness and fever, with irregularity day and night. This indicated a deficiency in the three yin energies, as well as in blood. He was treated with over twenty doses of the Eight Treasures decoction, adding Mai Dong and Wu Wei, and also with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction, incorporating Mai Dong and Wu Wei, along with Liu Wei Wan, leading to recovery. </p>
<p>A scholar named Zhang Ziling was prone to anger and had suffered from scrofula for a long time without improvement. His sores bled fresh blood, and the pulse at the left guan was strong but hard, suggesting that liver fire was causing erratic blood flow, indicating both qi and blood deficiency. He was treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi to replenish the spleen and lungs, and Liu Wei Wan to nourish the kidneys and liver, resulting in recovery. </p>
<p>One man had five hard tubercles below the ear for over a year; his complexion was sallow, appetite poor, and he experienced labor-induced fever. His pulse was rapid, soft, and weak. After taking over sixty doses of the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction, his vital energy recovered, and the afflicted area healed, leaving one tubercle. A follow-up treatment with Bi Xiao San led to its resolution. </p>
<p>Another individual developed a condition in front of and below the ear, which after recovery extended to the lateral neck and shoulder for three years, eventually spreading to the chest and armpits. Upon examination, his liver pulse was strong and rapid, and he was treated with Long Hui and San Jian pills. When he was about to recover, his liver pulse remained rapid. Four years later, he developed toxins in the lower abdomen and scrotum, which remained for over a year without improvement. The pulse diagnosis was as before, and he was cured with a combination of clearing liver and nourishing blood treatments alongside earlier prescriptions.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>One person, due to anger, developed a sore beneath the ear that extended to the axilla, with significant swelling and a malodorous wound that would not close. Treatment involved dispersing the swelling and promoting drainage, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another person, due to overexertion, experienced fatigue with fever; the pulse was large and forceful, but weak upon palpation. It was appropriate to use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. However, he did not believe it and rashly took purgative medicines, leading to continuous vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in death. Generally, this condition was inherently one of deficiency; if one does not discern between deficiency and excess and violates the regulations regarding diseases, it is rare not to suffer dire consequences. </p>
<p>Typically, treatment begins by regulating the menstrual cycle and relieving stagnation, and then using garlic moxibustion; many will resolve naturally. If not resolved, one should apply amber paste and, when there is pus, puncture it; otherwise, it may develop into another condition. If there are concomitant symptoms like phlegm or yin deficiency, one should only add agents for those symptoms and avoid interfering with other treatments. </p>
<p>If the qi and blood have already recovered but the mass has not dissipated, using dispersive agents may be appropriate, even if it takes over a month without improvement—the qi and blood will not feel weakened. Then, dispersing agents may be applied. Alternatively, if one encounters medicinal pills of unmatched potency, if their toxicity is profound, both medications should be stopped. Next, a few doses of the Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction can be used for adjustment. </p>
<p>If the wound does not heal, one may use fermented soybean cakes or amber paste. If there is a deficiency in both qi and blood, or if one carelessly eats or has emotional disturbances, no treatment should be administered. Nonetheless, in this condition, qi is paramount; with robust qi and blood, it is unnecessary to pursue corrosive agents, as they can self-decompose, but one should ensure the process facilitates closure. </p>
<p>If there is deficiency in qi and blood and one neglects to supplement first, while repeatedly using corrosive medicines, it is merely enough to invite failure. If there are chills and fever, and a red vein runs through the pupil of the eye, it should not be treated; if there is one vein, death occurs within a year; two veins indicate death within two years.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br>A person suffering from tuberculosis had excessive phlegm, a feeling of fullness and heaviness in the chest, and a tight pulse in the spleen and stomach. This indicates a deficiency in the spleen (earth) and an excess of liver (wood) overpowering it. The treatment should focus on strengthening the spleen and countering the liver. This patient prioritized treating phlegm first, taking bitter and cold phlegm-transforming medicines, which were ineffective, and then additionally taking Qi-breaking medicines, worsening the condition. Initially, they used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding several doses of Szechuan lovage; with reduced appetite and thoughts, they supplemented with a modified Middle-Strengthening and Qi-Benefiting Decoction by doubling the amount of white atractylodes, which improved their energy over a month. Later, they employed the Qi-Benefiting and Nourishing Decoction, leading to a reduction in swelling and a return of blood and energy after four months. </p>
<p>In this case, the tight pulse indicates an excess of wood, thus overpowering the spleen (earth) and acting as a harmful influence. Using bitter and cold medicines on a deficiency is a form of double deficiency. Moreover, phlegm can arise from various causes, necessitating different treatment methods. In general, when treating phlegm, excessive use of draining medicines can further weaken the spleen Qi, making phlegm easier to generate. If there is insufficient middle Qi, one must primarily use ginseng and atractylodes, supplemented by phlegm medicines.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br>A person suffered from a long-term illness with no signs of recovery; their mind was exhausted, and their pulse was weak. I wanted to administer the &quot;Tuo Li&quot; treatment, but they considered it impractical. Instead, they took a decoction for swelling and hard lumps. After more than half a month, they developed a fever, their appetite diminished, and they sought further treatment. I prescribed the &quot;Yiqi Yangrong&quot; decoction for three months. Because they diligently adhered to dietary restrictions, they were able to achieve results. Qi said: For tuberculous lymphadenopathy, if first detected, it should be treated internally. If it has persisted for a long time and the vital energy and blood are gradually declining, with cold muscles and chilled flesh, or with clear and thin pus, and toxic substances not expelled, with ulcer openings not closed, masses not red, and tubercles without pus, and the external symptoms unclear, &quot;Tuo Li&quot; treatment should be used. If pus has not formed, it should promote early pus formation. If pus has already discharged, it should encourage the rapid growth of new flesh. If blood and energy are deficient, &quot;Tuo Li&quot; should replenish them. If yin and yang are unbalanced, &quot;Tuo Li&quot; should adjust them. Generally, the method of &quot;Tuo Li&quot; ensures that ulcers do not exhibit signs of deterioration; this is why its use is advocated.</p>
<p>A woman had lymphadenopathy that extended to her chest and armpits, with pus and fluid oozing persistently. Over time, she experienced five heartburns, body aches, heaviness in her head and eyes, palpitations, flushed cheeks, a dry mouth and throat, feverish night sweats, decreased appetite, excessive sleeping, irregular menstrual periods, and abdominal pain. I diagnosed it as blood deficiency, not merely a result of the lymphadenopathy. After taking &quot;Xiaoyao San&quot; for a month, her condition improved slightly. She then took &quot;Bajian Tang&quot; with added peony root and Cyperus for over a month, and her menstruation normalized. After adding astragalus and white peony for two months, she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman had a lump that did not decay after it ruptured. With more than thirty doses of &quot;Yiqi Yangrong&quot; decoction, I also applied a powder to promote healing, followed by more than thirty additional doses of the original decoction, and then she healed.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a long-standing fever and had a delayed menstrual period with scant flow. I prescribed Xiaoyao San along with Yiqi Yangrong Decoction. After more than two months, her energy and blood were restored, and her sores healed. However, she did not respond well to oral medications, so I applied a powdered herbal mixture to her acupuncture point and administered moxibustion to the Jianjing point until she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman had lymphatic swellings but did not respond to blood-nourishing and qi-regulating medicines. After taking two doses of Shenxiao Gualou Powder, the condition improved immediately, and after six more doses, it completely resolved. After using drugs to relieve the obstruction, her energy and blood stabilized, and she recovered.</p>
<p>One woman had persistent lymphatic swellings and, due to a condition related to excessive wood energy, I attempted to reduce the swelling with a dispersing formula, which only worsened her condition. I believed that she had a deficiency in liver qi and blood, so I nourished the source of digestion with Liuwei Dihuang Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and by spring she was healed. If the condition was due to violent wind-fire in the liver with no loss of original qi, the previous decoction would be appropriate. If the wind-wood was excessive and caused her illness, then Xieqing Wan should be used, while the deficient should take Dihuang Wan. If water cannot nourish wood, this pill is also advised. If metal overcomes wood, one should tonify the spleen soil to generate water in the kidneys. In general, for diseases of wind and wood, strengthening the spleen soil will prevent wood from overcoming it. If we attempt to attack the liver, while bypassing the spleen and stomach, it results in wood overpowering earth.</p>
<p>A woman suffering from lymphatic swellings had poor sleep for over a year. The lesions burst and oozed pus. Her menstrual cycle was irregular, arriving either every fifty days or more than two months apart. She mistakenly took Tongjing Wan and was restless, unable to sleep. In the morning, she experienced chills, and in the afternoon, she had fevers. I diagnosed her condition as a result of worry leading to depletion of spleen blood. I concocted a Guipi Tang pill, taking 六君 (Liujun) in the morning and Xiaoyao in the afternoon, and after more than two months, she was able to sleep. After half a year, her menstrual cycle returned to normal, and after more than a year, her sores healed completely.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>A woman developed itching all over her body after suffering from a tuberculosis-like condition. Her pulse was large but weak upon palpation. She was treated with a complete tonic decoction and added Xiangfu, leading to recovery. Generally, after an ulcer, itching in the morning indicates Qi deficiency, while itching in the afternoon indicates blood deficiency. Treating this as a wind disorder would be fatal.</p>
<p>A man experienced swelling and pain with chills and fever, along with constipation. After six doses of a decoction of Shegan and Lianqiao, most of the heat subsided, and four doses of the Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction resulted in improvement.</p>
<p>A woman had swelling and pain beneath her ears with chills and fever. She was given four doses of Jingfang Baidu Powder, which resolved her exterior symptoms; then, a few doses of the decoction for reducing swelling and softening hardness significantly decreased the swelling. Follow-up treatment with four doses of a miraculous Guo Lou Powder led to recovery.</p>
<p>A man suffered from wind-heat in the liver channel, with swelling and pain beneath his ears and a floating, rapid pulse. He was treated with mint pills, which resolved his symptoms.</p>
<p>Another man experienced swelling beneath the ears when angry, with occasional pain in his flanks. He was treated with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction and added Qingpi, Muxiang, Honghua, and Taoren, leading to recovery after four doses.</p>
<p>A man had swelling in his neck that did not produce pus and a wiry, rapid pulse. He was treated with several doses of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction combined with the miraculous Guo Lou Powder and received moxibustion with garlic a few times, resulting in resolution after a month.</p>
<p>A woman had persistent swelling in her neck. She was given six doses of the miraculous Guo Lou Powder, which slightly reduced the swelling; further treatment with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction and additions of Qingpi, Zhike, and Beimu reduced the swelling significantly. Subsequently, a few doses of the Four Substance Decoction combined with Xiao Chai Hu led to recovery.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br>A man, due to extreme anger, developed swelling and pain under his jaw, leading to tuberculosis and feelings of oppression along with fever. He was treated with two doses of the Fang Mai Liu Qi formula, which relieved his chest congestion; then, he took two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du San, and the fever subsided. The liver pulse was still tight and slippery, so he received four doses of Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Peony, resulting in marked improvement in his pulse and symptoms. He took one dose of San Zhong Kui Jian Wan, and while most of the lumps subsided, one nodule remained. He then took two taels of Yu Xian Wu Bi Wan and was cured.</p>
<p>A woman who had long suffered from depression experienced a wound that would not heal, accompanied by fever and dry mouth, scant menstrual flow, lack of appetite, and significant fatigue in the afternoon. After taking over twenty doses of Yi Qi Yang Rong Tang, her condition improved slightly. I suggested she need one hundred doses to ensure safety. However, she sought quick results and instead took pills containing cantharides and repeatedly used aggressive toxins, which led to recurring nodules, resulting in continuous discharge and ultimately, no salvation. This condition was due to deficiency and stagnation of Qi, thus a restoration of physical strength, Qi, and regulation of menstrual pulses was needed. If a violent remedy were used, it would further deplete Qi and blood, increasingly manifesting as tuberculosis. The lumps remained unbroken; even if they ruptured, they would not heal, indicating insufficient Qi and blood. Moreover, the blood of the two channels was originally inadequate and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Another man had a long-standing condition that did not heal; pus was more clear, and he appeared yellow and emaciated. Every morning, he experienced diarrhea. After several doses of Er Shen Wan, his diarrhea stopped. He then took Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Chuanxiong and Angelica, and after a month, his body gradually recovered. He was treated with Mung Bean Cakes for moxibustion and used restorative measures to make a plaster, and after over three months, he was healed.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>A man suffered from this condition, which had not yet ulcerated, feeling fatigued and experiencing fever. He was treated with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction and showed slight improvement; however, after taking the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction for a month, it ulcerated and healed after another month.</p>
<p>A woman had accumulated heat in the liver meridian, causing pain and a rapid, deep pulse. After taking four doses of the She Xiang Lian Qiao decoction, she experienced slight improvement. She then took San Chong Gui Jian Wan for over a month and saw it diminish. Dan Xi noted that scrofula must arise from the foot Shao Yang meridian. If one does not follow restrictions, it may extend to the foot Yang Ming meridian. Rich food and prolonged stagnation of Qi can invoke poison, wind, and heat; these factors trigger transformations. One must differentiate between excess and deficiency; the excess is easier to treat, while the deficient requires caution. This meridian governs decisive actions, possesses fiery energy, and often presents with abundant Qi but scant blood. If a woman experiences this, particularly if her menstrual flow is irregular, it can lead to fluctuations of cold and heat, possibly developing into tidal fever. Unless there is a desire to eat bland foods, it is beyond the skill of a master physician to heal.</p>
<p>Another man had swelling and hardness that did not resolve for a long time and did not produce pus. He took a formula to dispel toxins and solid accumulations without effect; he was then instructed to moxa the tips of the elbow and shoulder; after continuing with the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction, the swelling dissipated after more than a month.</p>
<p>A man with a similar condition also received moxibustion at the front points and drank the same decoction; pus formed, and he was treated with acupuncture, which caused it to close.</p>
<p>A woman, provoked by anger, developed painful tubercles. Upon examination, her Qi and blood were both in excess. She first took a highly effective purging formula and then over thirty doses of the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction, after which the tubercles subsided. In treating this condition, if there is deficiency, one should first use the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction to replenish Qi and blood slightly before applying the purging formula to eliminate the toxins, then continue with the previous medication; success is guaranteed with this method.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br>A young woman, aged seventeen, experienced occasional pain under her jaw, with symptoms fluctuating between cold and hot, resembling malaria. Her liver pulse was strong and long, indicating an abundance of blood. I first administered two doses of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, which provided slight relief; then, I treated her with Sheng Di Huang Pill, resulting in recovery. </p>
<p>The &quot;Good Prescriptions for Women&quot; states that there has been no mention of the ailments of widows in the past. Only the writings of Cang Gong and discussions with Zhu Cheng touch upon how a widow, being solely yin without yang, desires a man but cannot obtain one, leading to depression and resulting in illness. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: &quot;As heaven and earth intertwine, all things transform; when male and female unite, all things are born.&quot; Can there be a solitary yang without yin? When one is confined within the boudoir, unfulfilled desires lead to a struggle between yin and yang, with symptoms alternating between cold and hot, resembling malaria, which can eventually lead to tuberculosis. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are symptoms such as amenorrhea, white discharge, phlegm reversal, headache, pleurisy, chest tightness, facial discoloration, and emaciation— all of which are ailments of widows. Upon examining her pulse, only the liver pulse was strong at the wrist above the fat pad. Delving into her pulse and understanding her illness revealed it was all due to an abundance of blood. The classics say: &quot;When a man&#39;s essence is vigorous, he thinks of a household, but when a woman&#39;s blood is abundant, she conceives.&quot; Observing this essence and blood indicates the matter is more than halfway understood.</p>
<p>One woman suffering for a long time without producing pus had a floating and slippery pulse. I aimed to replenish both qi and blood, but it began to spontaneously resolve. She desired internal consumption, strictly taking pills made from centipedes and medicines for dispersing hard masses; her qi and blood became even more deficient and she died.</p>
<p>A certain weak man, after an abscess, had a mass that did not decompose. Both his qi and blood were deficient. I used Tuo Li Yang Rong Decoction, which began to restore his qi and blood; the mass remained, so I used a hairpin to remove it. After taking decoctions for over a month, he recovered.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>A man had regained his vitality, and although the core was still intact, by using needles and dispersing medicine three times each, he recovered within a short period. </p>
<p>A woman became swollen in the neck due to anger, followed by irregular menstruation, swelling in her limbs, and painful urination. This was a blood condition. First, she took medicinal pills made from pepper seeds; her swelling subsided with her menstrual cycle. Then, she took the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Chai Hu and Zhi Ke, and after several days, her neck swelling also disappeared. There were also cases where difficulty in urination led to body swelling, causing menstrual blockage, known as a water condition, which should be treated with the Ting Li Pill. According to &quot;Good Remedies for Women,&quot; if a woman’s swelling began with menstrual cessation and later involved limb swelling and difficulty in urinating, it is known as a blood condition. Water transforms into blood, and if the blood is obstructed, it may revert to water. She should take the pepper seed pills. If the situation began with difficulty in urination, leading to body swelling and resulting in menstrual blockage, it is classified as a water condition, requiring the Ting Li pills.</p>
<p>There was a maiden, nineteen years old, who had neck swelling with unchanged complexion, her muscles gradually diminishing, and experiencing painful muscle spasms. This was due to emotional distress harming her, resulting in diminished blood and energy. She should first nourish her blood and energy. However, she did not believe it and took herbal medicine for wind, and consequently, her condition worsened. Lu Di Jing stated: &quot;The classics say: When the spirit suffers from overthinking, the flesh wastes away; when the mind suffers from worry, the limbs become incapacitated; when the soul suffers from sorrow, the muscles spasm; when the ethereal spirit suffers from excess joy, the skin becomes withered; when determination suffers from intense anger, the back can hardly bend or straighten.&quot; </p>
<p>A sick woman felt fatigued in her limbs, resembling a debility syndrome, and was cured by nourishing her blood and strengthening her spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>A woman in a room is often anxious and angry, experiencing swelling and pain under her ears, with chills and fevers. Her liver pulse is tense and rapid. I administered Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding Qing Pi, Niu Bang Zi, Jing Jie, and Fang Feng, which alleviated the chills and fevers. Additionally, I used Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with several doses of Si Wu Decoction to reduce the swelling. Her father wished to eliminate the root cause of the illness so that it would not recur. I explained that the liver is responsible for storing blood and nourishing the tendons. If anger disrupts the liver qi, it can injure the liver, leading to stagnation and swelling. The patient must learn to regulate herself to avoid further issues. Otherwise, with repeated liver injuries, blood storage is compromised; blood deficiency results in difficult symptoms. Later, without precaution, she developed three lumps and repeatedly used destructive medicines, which did not subside, and she ultimately died.</p>
<p>A young woman suffered swelling under her ears, had a hardworking nature, and experienced fevers and dry mouth. Her menstrual flow was always late and sparse. An old woman believed it was due to menstrual blockage and used leeches to treat it, which only led to further deficiency and death. The menstrual flow is governed by the Hand Taiyang and Hand Taiyin meridians. These two connections regulate one another, with the upper governing breast milk and the lower governing menstrual flow, representing the residual energy of the meridians. If there are no external invasions from the six excesses and no internal injuries from the seven emotions, and if the spleen and stomach are strong, then the qi of the Chong and Ren meridians is robust, making the menstrual flow arrive punctually. However, with a sallow complexion, thin limbs, fevers, dry mouth, and delayed and scant menstrual flow, it indicates a deficiency of yin blood, not an excess or blockage. It is advisable to gradually nourish the blood and qi with suitable remedies, allowing the menstrual energy to flourish and the flow to resume its normal timing.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br>Upon releasing a palace maid, aged over thirty, she experiences pain in her hips, without swelling or discoloration. She feels sharp pain during urination and defecation, and the pain intensifies when using the toilet. This condition is due to stagnant blood infiltrating the channels, indicating a disconnection between the sexes, which is difficult to treat. Subsequently, she developed abscesses and ultimately passed away. This woman was a concubine of the Tang family in our village; Tang was a merchant and often away, indicating that this woman, left alone for a long time, harbored repressed feelings and was unable to fulfill her desires, leading to her illness. The worsening condition with abscesses suggests that both emotional state and bodily fluids have been compromised, making aggressive treatments inappropriate. Thus, the &quot;Essence and Blood&quot; chapter states: if one engages with a woman without having fully circulated the essence, there will be unmet places in the body, leading to future ailments. If the yin is diminished but one still longs for sexual interaction to release the essence, the essence fails to exit and the body deteriorates. The urinary channel becomes obstructed, causing painful urination. As the essence is consumed and exhausted, the pathways for urination and defecation become more painful, leading to an increased urge, which in turn heightens the pain. If a woman, upon reaching her menstrual prime, does not have a male partner for over ten years, her condition will be unbalanced; if it has been less than ten years and she desires a partner, it will also cause imbalance. When imbalances occur, old blood will not flow out and new blood will stagnate, possibly seeping into the bones, causing swelling, or even making conception difficult despite coupling. Frequent male interactions may lead to an exhaustion of essence, and excessive lactation can deplete blood, threatening life. Observing her essence and blood, we can see that the situation is already quite severe.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br>A young woman, seventeen years old, suffers from lumps for a long time, with her monthly cycle yet to commence. She experiences fever and cough, lacking appetite. An elderly woman wishes to use medicinal herbs like croton and cinnamon to open her channels first. I said that this condition of tidal fever and irregular menstruation should not be treated in such a manner; however, if the pulse is not weak and does not show signs of tidal fever, there is still hope for treatment. One must nourish the vital energy and blood, and replenish the bodily fluids, allowing the channels to naturally open. They insist on quick-acting remedies regardless. I said: “This is not the correct treatment.” Such methods are harsh remedies that greatly enhance yang fire; if the yin blood enters this state, it leads to chaotic movement, and if the spleen and stomach endure it, they become more deficient. The channels may open but will not stop, leading to decreased appetite, increased tidal fever, and ultimately resulting in irretrievable decline. The text states: &quot;At seven years of age, a girl’s kidney energy is strong, and her teeth and hair grow long; by fourteen, the heavenly tide arrives, the ren channel opens, the tai chong pulse is vigorous, and the monthly cycle occurs regularly.&quot; However, when the time has passed without occurrence, it becomes abnormal and must have a cause. A woman’s life is based on vital energy and blood; when one becomes ill, it is invariably preceded by damage to these. Women often suffer from emotional strain. In the world, there are young women and men who harbor pent-up thoughts, excessive worry leading to strain, resulting in issues; men may display a drained look, while women may find their monthly cycles cease.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br>How can this be explained? It is because worry and contemplation harm the heart; when the heart is harmed, blood flows backwards and diminishes. When the blood flows backwards and diminishes, the spirit disperses, leading to the closing of the monthly flow. When fire is sick, it cannot nourish its offspring, thus losing its appetite. When the spleen is deficient, the metal energy is insufficient, leading to cough. When the water energy is exhausted, the limbs become dry. When the fundamental energy is not replenished, one becomes easily angered, the hair turns gray, and the muscles and bones weaken. One waits for the five organs to spread their conditions, and then one dies. This is a form of ailment within labor that is most difficult to treat, as the illness arises from within the five organs, with no clear end. The power of medicine cannot reach it. However, if one can adjust their mind and spirit and use medicine to support the recovery, then it is possible to achieve a narrow escape from death. This serves as an example. For the treatment of other ailments, one can diagnose based on pulse and symptoms. Zhang states: If a young woman’s monthly flow has not occurred for a long time, she must not use cooling agents like Artemisia. Many physicians believe that the blood of a young woman is hot and hence treat it with cooling medicines. What they do not understand is that blood flows when it is heated and coagulates when it is cold. &quot;The Essential Formulas for Health Preservation&quot; mentions this in great detail; this principle is very valid and should not be overlooked. If the cycle becomes slightly irregular and gradually becomes obstructed, with the bones and flesh of the hands and feet becoming painful and emaciated, and gradually producing tidal fever, and the pulse becomes thin and rapid, this is due to deficiency of yin and weakness of blood, with yang overpowering it. The small water cannot extinguish the strong fire, the fire pushes the water dry, and the essence is lost. It is necessary to nourish the water and increase yin; one must be cautious and not use toxic medicines to clear it, rather, one should consider Bai Zi Ren Wan and Ze Lan Wan.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>The Shen family had a problem with scrofula that persisted for a long time. They experienced spontaneous sweating and aversion to cold, indicating both qi and blood deficiency. After taking the Shiquan Dabu Decoction for about a month, it ruptured. However, even though the kernel was removed, the wound didn&#39;t close up. They then used moxibustion with a fermented bean cake and continued with the previous medication, adding costus root and cyperus, and it took two months to heal. Generally, if a wound is hard and does not rupture, or if it ruptures and does not heal, it is due to insufficient qi. I have seen cases where the wound, although it appeared to close, did not improve with nourishment, often turning into tuberculous lesions. Additionally, when there are red veins penetrating the eyes, it indicates a fatal condition.</p>
<p>One woman, after becoming angered, developed swelling and pain below her ear. She was treated with Jing Fang Bai Du San, along with Lian Qiao and Huang Qin, and recovered. I have also treated cases where swelling persisted for ten days without improvement by using herbs to tonify qi and blood, along with a spirit wine made from遠志 (distant will) and the swelling resolved on its own. In cases without pus, it would also eventually rupture. If one does not refrain from anger, treatment becomes difficult.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>A woman, due to anger, developed swelling under her ears, a headache, and alternating chills and fevers. She was treated with Jingfang Baidu San, adding Huangqin, which addressed the surface symptoms; however, she had little appetite and experienced evening fevers. Dongyuan remarked: although there is false heat, it should not be attacked heavily; if the heat is removed, cold will arise. Thus, she was treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang, adding Digupi, Chuanxiong, Danggui, Fuling, Bai Zhu, and Chenpi. After ten or more doses, she recovered.</p>
<p>The next spring, her condition hardened without breaking, and she sought the formula again. It was prescribed as Ba Zhen Tang with Xiangfu, Chai Hu, Digupi, and Jiegeng, which she made herself. After six or seven doses, her condition improved, yet she continued taking Ren Shen Baidu San, which worsened her state. She also took Liuqi Yin, resulting in night sweats, fever, a dry mouth, and loss of appetite. By autumn, she sought treatment again. Upon diagnosis, her qi and blood were critically deficient. I advised against treatment, and she consequently passed away.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when people have sores and ulcers, they do not examine the fundamental deficiency or excess of qi, nor the surface or internal condition; they simply take Baidu or Liuqi medicine, not realizing that Baidu San is for treating surface symptoms. If there are surface symptoms, only one or two doses should be taken; more can harm the original qi and worsen the toxicity. Though there is Ren Shen, it cannot replenish what is lost. Liuqi Yin is a depleting medicine; if the qi is bound and the chest feels full, only two or three doses are advisable; more can harm the blood and qi, resulting in a worsening condition, and although there is Xiong and Gui, they are not reliable. Danxi noted: this is not a transformation of rich foods or damp toxins, but is caused by deficiency and qi stagnation.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a persistent abscess that would not heal, with clear pus not drying up. I treated her with Ba Zhen Tang, and she improved slightly; however, she suddenly experienced pain in her shoulders and back, making it impossible for her to turn her head. This was caused by stagnation in the bladder meridian, and should be treated with Fang Feng Tong Qi Tang. The bladder meridian begins at the inner canthus of the eye, crosses the forehead to the crown, descends near the ears, and then continues to the back of the head, passing down the neck to the shoulders, and extends down to the lower back. When the meridian&#39;s energy is disturbed, it results in back pain and a stiff neck, which clearly indicates a bladder meridian issue. </p>
<p>She insisted that the abscess was related to the gallbladder meridian and that its path affects the sides of the neck; this implies that there is fire disturbance in the meridian. She then took herbal medicine to clear the liver and reduce fire, which caused her to lose her appetite and experience severe pain. She requested that I examine her pulse again, and I found her stomach energy had become weaker. I first prescribed Si Jun Zi Tang combined with Chen Pi, Chao Shao Yao, Ban Xia, Qiang Huo, and Man Jing Zi in four doses, which helped her eat and relieved her pain. I then continued with two doses of Fang Feng Tong Qi Tang, and she recovered.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br>The woman of the Tian family, over thirty years of age, suffered from scrofula, which had ulcerated and failed to heal. She received Ba Zhen Decoction with additional Chai Hu, Di Gu Pi, Xia Ku Cao, Xiang Fu, and Bei Mu—over fifty doses—resulting in gradual improvement of her physical condition. Further, she was given Bi Xiao San in two doses, which allowed the ulcer to close, but her vitality and blood remained unbalanced. After taking an additional thirty doses of the previous medicine, her condition stabilized. Later, Tian Sheng relied on this formula indiscriminately to treat others, not differentiating between those who were weak or strong, completely unaware that the ingredients included certain toxic substances, which though effective in treating scrofula, could deplete vital energy if used excessively. If a patient had excess vitality and blood, it would be appropriate to first use this to purge, and then follow up with tonics for recovery. However, if the patient was weak and purgative medicine was applied, or if corrosive medicine was used, while the stagnant flesh might be removed, the ulcer would not close properly, leading to difficulties in treatment.</p>
<p>In Guangdong, Chen Fangbo&#39;s son, after a long and exhausting journey, developed a fever with a weak, large pulse and swelling beneath the ear, indicative of strain damage. Administering a restorative formula known as Zhong Yi Qi Tang naturally helped reduce the fever and swelling. If one were to focus excessively on detoxification, it could lead to further weakness. Despite this warning, the patient took fire-reducing medicine and Bi Xiao San, ultimately leading to vomiting, diarrhea, and death by starvation. Strain and exhaustion diminish vitality; as vitality declines, fire surges. The surging fire harms the spleen&#39;s function, resulting in weariness and fever, a sign of injured vital energy. Danxi stated: one should restore vitality and balance the meridians; only then would the sores heal on their own. Sweating or purging should not be done. If one blindly applies purgatives without discerning the unique pulse conditions and meridian pathologies, danger is rarely avoided.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>Wang Zhonghan&#39;s nephew, aged twenty, suffered from a painful lump below his ear. The left pulse was weak and rapid, caused by wind-heat in the liver channel. After three doses of Jingfang Baidu San, the surface symptoms completely retreated. Then, he was given Sanzhong Hui Jian Wan, and after a month, he recovered fully.</p>
<p>A woman aged twenty had a lump below her ear that corresponded with her menstrual cycle, experiencing headaches in the afternoon after her period started. The wind medicine she took only exacerbated her condition. I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang with the additions of Chai Hu and Di Gu Pi for over twenty doses, and she recovered.</p>
<p>Yang Wenkui, over thirty, experienced swelling and heat in his neck due to overwork. The Baidu San he took increased his symptoms. I provided several doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang which led to a reduction in his symptoms.</p>
<p>A woman with a lump, after it ruptured, developed a fever, was restless and thirsty, with a strong yet weak pulse, indicating blood deficiency. I administered six doses of Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang which immediately alleviated her condition. Then, I used Sheng Yu Tang for several doses to promote recovery. Additionally, I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang with the additions of Bei Mu and Yuan Zhi for over thirty doses, leading to improvement. Dongyuan noted that symptoms of fever accompanied by heat, persistent thirst, agitation, and warm skin, together with a strong, weak pulse or symptoms like eye pain and dry nose, are not indicative of Bai Hu Tang syndrome, but rather blood deficiency causing agitation, to be principally addressed with Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang. Furthermore, for cases of internal heat with inability to eat, accompanied by spontaneous sweating and shortness of breath, one should use cooling remedies to drain heat and tonify qi. If there is an ability to eat despite heat, with dry mouth and tongue, along with constipation, one should employ harsh cooling remedies to counteract heat and replenish fluids.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br>A man had a large tubercle on his neck that ulcerated. I used gardenia to clear liver fire, nourish liver blood, and prescription to benefit vital energy, resulting in recovery. There are also cases where the size is as large as a rice bowl, and these can be treated with the previous medicine for recovery.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old boy had two nodules on his neck, experienced intermittent chills and fever, and after a long time was still not well. I treated him with Lianqiao pills, which resolved the issue. This pill is especially effective for afflictions on the face and arms. If it ulcerates and does not heal, additionally apply a medicine to promote healing.</p>
<p>Another child had a single nodule on his neck, hard like a scab, with a pale yellow complexion and poor appetite. He did not respond to the detoxifying medicine; it was due to non-punitive malnutrition toxins. I treated him with Chan Su pills, leading to recovery. If after several doses it does not dissolve, if pressed and it moves, soft and painless, there are worms like powder inside, urgently needle them out. If not done quickly, the worms will roam with the qi and erode the organs, which would be untreatable. </p>
<p>To obtain toads, catch those that are large and do not jump or croak from ditches in the summer. First, take a scoop of maggots and place it in a bucket, soaking it in urine. Keep the bucket dry at the top to prevent the maggots from escaping. Then, kill the toad and throw it into the maggot bucket, allowing the maggots to feed. Next, wrap it in a new cloth bag and place it in fast-moving water overnight. Take it out, bake it on a tile until powdered, adding a word of musk. Form the mixture into pills the size of sesame seeds, taking two or thirty pills each time with rice water on an empty stomach.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>A woman, due to anger, lost her appetite, experienced fever and fatigue, had aching bones, became thin and pale, and her condition worsened. She developed a lump in her neck, and though treated with Xiao Yao San and Ba Zhen Tang, there was only slight improvement; she then self-medicated with leeches and other drugs, which further weakened her blood and energy, eventually leading to her demise.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Surgery&quot; states: A man suffered from a neck abscess for over ten days. Observing the severity of the wound, the roots extended towards both ears and the area was swollen, red, and hot, with a floating and rapid pulse. Initially, two doses of Huang Lian Xiao Du San were administered to reduce the seriousness, stabilizing the roots slightly. Later, several doses of Tuo Li Xiao Du San were given, yet it unexpectedly became necrotic. Upon examining the pulse, it was weak and floating. Inquiring about the patient revealed he was over fifty, had long struggled with fertility issues, had a concubine at home, and was burdened by excessive worry and overexertion, which harmed his vital energy. The size of the abscess was significant, merely able to erupt but unable to develop into pus. Therefore, a dose of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang was prescribed, adding Jie Geng and Bai Zhi, with double portions of Ren Shen and Bai Zhu, each three qian. Externally, the mulberry wood moxibustion method was used, applied twice daily; also, Zi Xia Ointment was applied for several days. The patient’s head and face were swollen, both eyes nearly shut; his condition became alarming. Eventually, the wound eroded and began to produce pus, yielding several liters over the course of half a month.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>When previous medicines could not manage the situation, accompanied by inner restlessness, five hearts in turmoil, and a gradual decrease in appetite, the excessive purulent discharge indicated a false manifestation of deficiency fire. A dose of Shengyu Decoction was administered but did not respond; then another dose was given with an additional two qian of prepared Aconite. The earlier symptoms entirely receded. After that, Ren Shen Yang Rong Decoction was modified with Mai Dong and Wu Wei, with the amounts of Ren Shen and Sha Ren increased to three qian, regulating for over a month. Later, the rotting flesh of the skull continually fell off in pieces, presenting a disheveled sight, causing astonishment among all who witnessed it. There were fears that the decay was extensive and would not be restored in time. Therefore, in the daily congee, three qian of Ren Shen was used, with it included in every meal to strengthen the spleen’s essence. Gradually, the vital energy began to revive, and after four months of regulation, recovery was achieved. Later, a year passed and a son was born, securing the continuation of the lineage.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>A woman had been enduring pain for four to five days, undergoing moxibustion over twenty times without realizing it was painful. The burn marks turned dark and flattened as usual. Upon examination, her pulse was weak, rapid, and without strength, indicating an internal deficiency. If one relied solely on medicinal potency, it would lead to distressing outcomes. Instead, a fine needle was used to pierce about an inch deep without causing pain or drawing blood, showing that the poison was stagnant and had not manifested. A piece of toad venom was inserted into the needle hole once a day, covered with ointment. After seven days, abscesses began to ooze pus and blood from the surrounding area. She took purely restorative medicine, and after fourteen days, a piece of necrotic tissue the size of a fingertip and over an inch long fell out. Then, with the use of jade red ointment, her flesh healed evenly. After another half month, the wound was level, and using pearl powder on it, skin regenerated instantly, resulting in healing. If this condition had not been treated with needles and relied exclusively on medicinal potency to dissolve it, it may not have been fatal, but could it have achieved such a swift recovery?<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br>A patient with a newly emerging sore on the neck was examined. The sore was located more on the right side and should not be taken lightly; moxibustion was necessary. After applying moxa with garlic for fifteen applications, pain was felt, and treatment ceased. Later, the patient considered it a minor issue and neglected internal medicine. Four days later, the sore reappeared, accompanied by swelling in the neck, rigidity, and deep purple pain, along with constipation. The pulse was firm and strong. I prescribed an internal formula of疏黄连汤 with two qian of Yuanming powder to relieve the constipation, followed by two doses of消毒救苦汤. However, the swelling continued severely, indicating that internal toxins had manifested externally and could not be easily dispelled, leading to a change in medication to托里消毒散. </p>
<p>After nearly twenty days, the patient was quite overweight, and the outer flesh was tight, not turning to necrosis. I intended to perform acupuncture to open the sore, but the family strongly resisted. However, when complications arose, leading to agitation and confusion where the patient could not recognize anything, the family regretted their decision. I proceeded to use a steel needle to open points near the ears and along the neck, cutting away about an inch of stubborn flesh to release a significant amount of toxic pus and blood. </p>
<p>I then administered internal medicines to strengthen the spleen and stomach, nourish Qi and blood, support the body, and improve deficiencies. The pus flowed out like a spring without stopping. Each morning and evening, I combined the medicine with food, administering six or seven qian until the necrotic flesh was completely expelled and new flesh appeared. After around forty days, the patient began to gradually recover, started to regain awareness, but could not recall the events leading up to this condition. If acupuncture and knives had been forbidden, and there had been no rigorous supplementation, would survival have been possible? As the patient’s son began to understand the principles involved and trusted my words, the patient was cured in less than a hundred days.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>A woman, aged four weeks, was very obese and had sores on her neck for five to six days. Upon examination, the flesh was swollen but the sores were not, along with a dry mouth and a troubled heart. The color was hard and purple, the root and base dispersed and flat, and her six pulses were large and forceful. This indicated an excess condition; there would certainly be no pus and neglecting treatment would lead to problems. She then sought medical attention again. Some said it was an external issue, while others claimed it was internal consumption. Some remarked that her youthful age was not a hindrance, while others said a large pulse indicated easy treatment. The crowd was confused and each used their own remedies. After seven or eight days, her chest and neck both became swollen and hard. They again sought help for a decision. I said: This is untreatable; why? There are several reasons: first, the initial signs showed swollen flesh but no sore; second, the root and base were flat and dispersed, indicating a deficiency of true Qi unable to contain the toxic energy; third, a dry mouth and troubled heart indicated internal fire; fourth, a purple and dark appearance suggested stagnant blood and toxic accumulation with no tendency to ulcerate; fifth, the large pulse indicated that the toxic sore was flourishing, with the vital energy being overcome, leading to the eventual softening and sinking of the sore, followed by internal invasion of toxic heat leading to death. Therefore, preparations for the later stages were essential. She ultimately passed away in the twenty-seventh day. It is lamentable that the people of this time chose to treat frivolously without understanding the real principles of disease.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br>A man had a sore on his neck for five or six days, and went to see it without taking much thought; his head turned yellow, and the root spread wide. I said, &quot;This must be treated urgently.&quot; He left, displeased with my words. He then sought a doctor from the neighborhood, who declared it a minor ailment, which pleased him. After using the medicine for another five days, the sore had hardened, its root expanded, and the poison had spread to his shoulders, flowing down to his neck, causing swelling in his chest and breasts, along with nausea, vomiting, chills, fever, and a lack of appetite. The condition of the sore appeared truly fearsome, and he began to believe my earlier words, again seeking my treatment. The appearance of the sore was dreadful; it was beyond the reach of medicinal power. </p>
<p>I first used a scallion and mugwort decoction to wash away the old medicine, then boiled some medicine and performed cupping at two places to draw out the stagnant blood. I followed this by inserting a silver needle at an angle into the root of the sore to penetrate the affected areas, placing toad venom into the openings. After that, I detoxified and promoted pus generation, finally covering the area with a healing ointment and applying a magical plaster from the True Monarch. Gradually, the condition improved, and the poison retreated back to the original area at the back of the neck. </p>
<p>In addition, he took internal medicine to lower fire and transform phlegm for three to four days. Once the major issues subsided and the internal pus was cleared, he switched to taking a herbal tonic to strengthen his body. For all hard nodules that would not dissolve, treat them; for those that were rotten but not painful, remove them; for new growths that were slow to heal, nurture them. By managing his condition in this manner for nearly three months, he finally achieved a complete recovery. This serves as a caution that the patients&#39; reluctance to admit illness and seek medical help can lead them close to death.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>A woman in her sixties, hailing from a family of officials, was inherently timid and weak. She suffered from a sore on her neck that initially appeared as a small bump, which was thought to be a condition that could accommodate grain. Appreciative of her slender form, despite the condition progressing and potentially leading to corrosion, it was worth noting beforehand. </p>
<p>First, I applied garlic moxibustion, followed by placing toad venom cake around the edges to draw out toxins and scatter them, in order to keep the roots intact. Internally, I prescribed a detoxifying formula to take several times, but the sore remained hard and painful, and I indicated it would take until a certain day to improve. Moreover, since the sore had not begun to break down, examining her pulse revealed it was thin and rapid without strength, indicating internal weakness and an inability to resolve the toxins into pus, with pain being the priority; thus, how could it be expected to improve?</p>
<p>Next, I switched to a formula to benefit qi and nourish the essence, adding schisandra and angelica, and after three doses, the swelling gradually began to rise. Externally, I employed the mulberry wood moxibustion technique, and the hardness gradually softened, with pus emerging thick but not abundantly.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br>In the front, apply the angle-needle and white angelica, with a double dose of ginseng and astragalus. After several doses, only then will the pus gather and break. Even after the break, the pain does not cease. I said: &quot;In three more days, after noon, the pain may stop.&quot; When the time arrived, the necrotic tissue had fallen off by half. Near noon, I used a dose of frankincense to quell the pain, and in the afternoon, the pain suddenly receded, allowing for a peaceful sleep. The patient&#39;s family was overjoyed. I said: &quot;Not so; it is merely that the medication has been applied appropriately at the right time. Though my prediction extends to half a month, it applies at this moment. Trust in it, and you will not go astray.&quot; In the coming days, the necrosis will be fully resolved, the flesh will revert to normal, and the mouth will be restored. The family made notes with black string to track the days and found that there was neither excess nor deficiency. This method requires keen observation, a measure of the disease&#39;s difficulty, the speed of decomposition, and the adequacy of supplementary treatments. The medication must align with principles, and then the number of days can be accurately gauged, ensuring the result is certain in advance.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>A woman in her prime had a sore on her neck for three days, with its opening facing forward. Her family was fearful, as she was overweight, and this location was not typical for such a sore. I examined her high forehead and lively presence; though the sore was troubling, it could be tolerated. She wanted to treat it from the inside, but I advised her against medication, suggesting instead the use of acupuncture. She agreed. I used a fine needle to penetrate six or seven points deep into the sore, stopping at the soft tissue to release the stagnant blood. I then inserted a piece of toad venom into the hole and instructed her to take toad venom pills, leading to a great sweat and resolution. The next day, a little pus began to emerge from the sore, gradually decreasing. Concerned that internal toxins might still be present, I prescribed a few medications to detoxify and clear heat. Within ten days, she was well. Generally, when one seeks to dissipate a sore, one must first eliminate the root cause, then release the toxic energy, allowing the toxin to weaken, avoiding any internal aggression.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br>A man had an abscess behind his ear for more than ten days. He thought it was a minor ailment and did not seek treatment. After nearly half a month, the base of the abscess grew larger, with the wound only oozing bloody fluid, foul and filthy, surrounded by purple-black skin, soft and sunken without pus. His face was pale, his nose nostrils flared, hands were cold, and his breathing was rapid. Upon examining his pulse, it was loose and big without a root; this was a sign of internal failure, so there was no need for treatment. It would be chaotic to use medicine in this case. He then called in another physician to treat him, who also inquired and found no issues. The patient resented me for not treating him and, whenever he encountered friends or family, he forced himself to hold on, sternly insisting he would not accept death. I said: &quot;If your heart is unwilling, you will not die yet. In five more days, you will surely die.&quot; As it turned out, he did. I often observed wounds, and if they encountered this sign, even a body as solid as a mountain would inevitably collapse.</p>
<p>Another man had a swollen, painful nodule on his neck, with stiffness and chills. I prescribed Jingfang Baiduxiao powder in two doses, and the exterior symptoms all subsided. However, the nodule did not disappear. I then used a formula to dissipate the swelling and soften hard lumps, adding Chuanxiong, Xiangfu, and Fritillaria for over ten doses, and the nodule gradually diminished; externally, I applied amber ointment to it. After more than a month, he was well.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>A man crossed a river in midwinter; suddenly, a thick fog arose, causing him great fear. The next day, he experienced alternating chills and fever, with swelling across his head, face, and ears. He initially took two doses of Huoxiang Zhengqi San, which relieved the chills and fever, and the facial swelling gradually subsided. However, the swelling at the nape of his neck remained hard and painful, indicating an accumulation of poison likely to turn into pus. He continued with Huoxiang Zhengqi San, adding Chuanxiong, Danggui, and Zaozi for several doses, and once the pus was ripe, it was drained, leading to a quick reduction in the swelling and pain. He was then given Shi Quan Da Bu Tang to strengthen his spleen and promote recovery.</p>
<p>A woman had been a widow for six years with a young child and had developed a hardened emotional state due to worry over the past six months. Additionally, she faced menstrual irregularities, alternating chills and fever, and significant weight loss, with a taut and rapid pulse. This condition was due to the exhaustion of her qi and blood, and the reckless movement of liver fire. The principle is to replenish what has been lost; one should not use harmful medications that further deplete. Initially, she took Xiaoyao San with added Xiangfu, Danshen, and Fritillaria to harmonize her blood and relieve liver qi stagnation. After that, she used Yiqi Yungong Tang for over a month, gradually restoring her qi and blood, which helped regulate her menstrual cycle and revive her vitality. Externally, fire needles were used to puncture the hardened area, inserting yellow medicinal threads several times until the holes widened. Then, Bingzi San was applied over the area and sealed. By the thirteenth day, the hardened mass fell off. She applied Hongyu ointment to promote healing and contraction, while internally switching to Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang with Xiangfu and Mu Xiang for over thirty doses, which restored her health. The woman was careful in her daily routines, avoided emotional disturbances, and maintained a restrictive diet, which allowed her to recover; otherwise, it would have been impossible.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br>A young woman, seventeen years old, experienced her father&#39;s failure in selecting a suitor, and as time elapsed, she became ill for over two months. Her symptoms included hard nodules on her neck, as tough as stone, indicating a condition of liver stagnation and muscle contraction. Additionally, she suffered from interruptions in her menstrual flow, alternating between cold and heat like intermittent fever, along with a cough and rapid pulse, though her cheeks were not flushed. This signified the onset of a deficiency of yin with excessive fire, leading to a consumptive condition that could not be cured by medication. Observing her physical appearance, she showed no signs of decay. I said, to treat this illness, one must first address her heart; there is still hope for recovery. The father then asked, &quot;What medicine can treat the heart?&quot; I replied, &quot;It is not a matter of medicine.&quot; The Book of Changes states: &quot;Heaven and earth are in a state of diffusion, and all things transform into purity; the union of male and female essence leads to the generation of all things.&quot; This is the way of creation and nurturing between heaven, earth, and humanity. This illness arises solely from a lack of yang energy in the face of excessive yin, resulting in stagnation and inhibition, described as an illness contrary to natural principles. The young woman experienced a significant loss in her potential match, which should have materialized but did not, gradually leading to a debilitating condition. Her ailment is not a result of her own making, but rather a consequence of the changing times.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br>Thus, the medicine alone cannot bring recovery; it is essential for yin and yang to harmonize and for rain to fall, for a couple to be harmonious in order for the family&#39;s affairs to flourish. Only after this time can medicine be effectively used. The father began to understand and immediately chose a wife. Three months later, he requested to see her again, and the previous condition was somewhat stabilized. Initially, he used Xiaoyao San augmented with Xiangfu, Qingpi, Shanzhi, Danpi, and Beimu—over a dozen doses—to soothe the liver and alleviate stagnation, gradually reducing cold and heat; next, he used Renshen Yangrong Tang with added Danpi and Honghua to invigorate the blood vessels, promoting the generation of heart blood and improving the complexion slightly; also, he used Yiqi Yangrong Tang, doubling the Renshen and adding Zhu, to strengthen the spleen and stomach, enhancing appetite; intermittently, he used Guipi Tang with added Maidong, Wuweizi, Yuanzhi, and Shashen to gather the spirit and calm the temperament; additionally, he prepared Renshen, Zhu, and Dihuang ointment, taken for six months, leading to a remarkable recovery in spirit and menstrual regulation, though a core could not be entirely expelled; he used a fire needle to puncture a core, applying amber ointment, which gradually decayed into pus, and after two months it healed. The remaining three swellings were slowly pierced, gradually breaking down and healing. Throughout the entire process, he consistently used the spleen-nourishing and stagnation-resolving medicines, and after regulating for a year, he finally achieved complete recovery.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br>A man nearing thirty, with a few hard nodules on his neck, a pale complexion, a tired spirit, coarse skin, and rapid pulse, exhibited signs of injured vital energy. He should first nourish his qi and blood, and once the foundation is strengthened, then treat the sores. He took over ten doses of herbs to nourish and strengthen the spleen, but saw no effect. Thinking it would take time, he became misled by an alchemist and took medicine on his own, including drugs from the centipede, ba, and musk, which caused him to have continuous diarrhea for ten or more times. Following this, his urination became incessant, with worsening empty heat, and his appetite diminished. When he sought another examination, he appeared internally depleted and unable to be regulated, and he declined further treatment. Later, he regretted this; although he sought a physician for strong remedies to support and reduce his internal heat, it ultimately did not respond, and he died.</p>
<p>A woman in her prime, with a hasty nature, had a husband who contributed nothing to the household. For half a year, a nodule formed on her left neck, gradually growing to the size of a chicken egg, hard as stone, with red veins encircling it. Her pulse was wiry and rapid. The wiry nature indicated errant liver fire, and the rapidity showed excessive spleen heat. Initially, she was given a Regulating Liver Decoction with Gardenia to calm the liver wood, and after five doses, her pulse began to normalize. Then, she took several doses of a Decoction to Clear the Liver and Relieve Depression to disperse the stagnation. Next, she used a Nourishing Qi and Blood Decoction to regulate her qi and blood, occasionally taking a decoction to disperse swelling and soften the hard nodules, while applying amber ointment externally. After a hundred days of this regimen, her vital energy was restored, and the hardness had largely dissipated, leaving only a small nodule. Thinking she was cured, she stopped taking medication. However, a year later, her husband faced a losing gamble, leading to sudden anxiety and fear, causing a recurrence of the swelling. Her pulse became wiry, thin, and rapid, indicating a depletion of yin blood, with yang fire surging, and her previous symptoms reappeared.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br>Moreover, there are also issues with the chest and diaphragm, food and drink lack flavor, the urine is excessive and early, and the appearance is haggard and unrefined. This is due to the spirit being hurt by overthinking, leading to loss of flesh; the mind being distressed by sorrow, leading to paralysis of the limbs; the soul being wounded by sadness, leading to muscle cramps; the corporeal spirit being harmed by excessive joy, leading to skin deterioration; and the will being injured by violent anger, leading to inability to move the spine. All these are symptoms of internal damage from the seven emotions. </p>
<p>The treatment should nourish the qi and blood, harmonize the spleen and stomach, strengthen the kidneys, and clear the heart, relieving depression and stagnation to ensure safety. However, they are unwilling to believe and still wish to take the previous medicines to reduce swelling and resolve hardness, and they want to moxibust the swollen area to achieve internal resolution. I said: This is not like before; now I dare not treat it. Please have the visiting physician create the previous medicine, also moxibust the affected area, and moxibust the elbow tip. This is truly a matter of addressing a deficiency with further deficiency and dealing with an excess with further excess.</p>
<p>In the end, it resulted in increased fever, spontaneous sweating, coughing, a stiff neck, limbs unable to retract, no pus from the moxibustion wounds, blood and water not stopping, and swelling becoming more intense; this indicates damage to the organs and cannot last long. Moreover, a month later there were reports of breathlessness, hoarseness, and the expulsion of phlegm and blood, leading to death. I have often seen incompetent doctors fail to distinguish between deficiency and excess, and patients not trusting proper principles, listening only to medications, often leading to irreparable outcomes, happening eight or nine times out of ten. All physicians and patients should take heed and be cautious!<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a></p></div>

When the internal organs are full, it leads to disease; when they are deficient, it causes organ disease. &quot;Anqiao&quot; refers to massage and guiding exercises, facilitating the flow of yang energy throughout the limbs. In winter, the yang energy is hidden; if one attempts to promote its outward flow, it cannot support the energies of spring and summer growth, thus leading to nasal bleeding and neck issues. In spring, when the disease is in the neck, it&#39;s due to external heat forcing its way through the channels, causing nasal bleeding that emerges from the lower neck, which constitutes illness in the neck.】<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

<p>When the pulse pushes down and does not rise, it indicates a headache.</p>
<p><strong>On the True Organs of Jade Mechanism</strong></p>
<p>The major bones are withered, the flesh is sunken. The chest is full of Qi, making it hard to breathe; internal pain radiates to the shoulders and neck, with a prognosis of death within one month. When the true organ&#39;s pulse is observed, I give it a timeframe.</p>
<p>The internal pain indicates lung injury, with the lung&#39;s correspondences found in the shoulders and back, hence the pain radiates there. If liver illness has transmitted to the organ it governs, then the prognosis is death within this month. The true organ’s pulse feels like pressing along the sharp edge of a knife, or like plucking the strings of a guqin. The expected date of death will be at twilight on a Geng or Xin day.</p>
<p>The major bones are withered, the flesh is sunken. The chest is full of Qi, making it hard to breathe; internal pain radiates to the shoulders and neck, accompanied by fever and the falling away of flesh, with a prognosis of death within ten days. </p>
<p>The lung is affected, hence the pain radiates to the shoulders and back; if it has affected the heart, this causes the fever. The heart governs blood, which is generated from the essence of the kidneys. When blood and Qi are abundant, there is heat in the flesh. If both the heart and kidneys are damaged, leading to declining essence and blood, this is why it is called the falling away of flesh.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The true pulse appears large and weak, like a feather on human skin, the illness transmitted to the heart, hence projected to die within ten days. The heart does not suffer from evil influences, thus the swiftness of death. The major bones are dry and emaciated, the flesh sinks down, there is fullness in the chest, pain in the abdomen, discomfort in the heart, heat in the shoulders and body, the flesh falls away, the eye sockets are sunken, the true pulse is visible, and one does not see others—the individual dies suddenly; those who do see others die when they reach a point beyond endurance.</p>
<p>The classic text states: For kidney disease, there is pain in the lower abdomen. The kidneys affect the heart, leading to discomfort in the heart. The heart affects the lungs, which influence the liver, hence the heat in the shoulders and body. The liver affects the spleen, resulting in sunken eye sockets. The true pulse exhibits sudden interruptions, like a finger striking a stone with a crisp sound. If one cannot see others, it means the essence and energy of the kidneys have been exhausted, thus death occurs suddenly. Those who see others still have residual energy; they die when they reach their limit, specifically at sunset.

The stomach channel is affected by evils, leading to difficulty in eating and drinking, blockage of the diaphragm, and abdominal fullness. When stomach qi is deficient, the front of the body feels cold, and abdominal distension occurs; thus, if the person feels cold, the abdomen distends, and if they drink cold, they experience diarrhea, indicating damage from weak stomach qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Reversal Symptoms</h3>
<p>When the lesser yang is in reversal, the mechanisms are not functioning properly; one cannot walk with the waist, nor turn the neck. [Note: The lesser yang governs the joints, hence when its energy is in reversal, the mechanisms are impaired. The neck is where the three yangs converge; the waist and spine are the major joints of the body. Therefore, if the mechanisms are impaired, one cannot turn to walk with the waist, nor turn the neck.]</p>
<p>When the hand of the greater yang is in reversal, there is deafness and tears flow out; one cannot turn to view, nor look up or down with the waist, as it indicates ailments that the physician must address. [Note: The conditions produced by the hand of the greater yang include deafness. The small intestine governs fluids, hence its reversal results in tears. The heart governs blood vessels, and the small intestine, which pertains to liquid, is the exterior of the heart. When the energy of the small intestine is in reversal, the fluids cannot nourish the channels, leading to the inability to turn the neck or move the waist. The area between the waist and neck is where the major channels and collaterals converge.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

<p>Qibo said: If febrile disease lasts for one day, it affects the Greater Yang, hence the pain in the head and neck, and the stiffness in the lower back. 【Note: The solar qi governs the skin and hair; therefore, if febrile disease lasts one day, it is influenced by the solar energy. Since the Yang energy is upward, there is pain in the head and neck. The back is associated with Yang, hence the stiffness in the lower back.】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Abdominal Conditions</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: There is a disease characterized by swelling in the chest, pain in the neck, fullness in the chest, and abdominal distension. What is this disease? How does one acquire it? Qibo replied: This is called &quot;reversal of qi.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Essential Truths of the Great Principles</strong></p>
<p>When the Greater Yin governs the heavens, if dampness overcomes it, then it sinks and disperses, causing rain, withering, swelling, bone pain, and Yin obstructive syndromes. Yin obstruction means that pressing on it yields no effect, with stiffness in the lower back and pain in the head and neck. 【Note: The dampness dominating above causes the Yin to sink and disperse, causing plants to wither and resulting in swelling and Yin obstruction, all triggered by cold dampness. The disease in the Yin is termed &quot;obstruction,&quot; hence pressing yields no effect. The kidneys govern bones, and the bladder is their associated organ, thus causing pain in the lower back, head, and neck bones.】 </p>
<p>When the Greater Yin prevails, fire energy becomes congested internally, leading to ulcers inside and dispersing externally, affecting the sides. In severe cases, there may be heart pain and heat afflictions, headaches, throat obstructions, and stiffness in the neck. 【Note: When dampness and heat are excessive outside, fire energy becomes congested internally, causing ulcers. When the heat and damp energy disperses outward, it affects the sides. In severe cases, heart pain results when wood energy is excessive and transmits to fire.】<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Headaches with neck stiffness and throat tightness are caused by a mixture of wind, heat, and dampness, ascending from the neck to the crown of the head. When the Yang energy overwhelms, heat rises, causing pain in the head and neck, making the eyes appear protruded. The rising of heat refers to the Yang energy that ascends through the channels into the brain, then descends into the lower neck. The return of the Yin results in dampness rising, leading to heaviness and increased sensitivity in the head and neck. This heaviness and sensitivity are particularly severe because of dampness, as if the head is wrapped. When dampness is not expelled, the large and small muscles become affected—tightness leads to rigidity, while relaxation leads to weakness. When the Lesser Yin governs, if the external force overcomes, it results in sneezing, neck stiffness, heat in the shoulders and back, and headaches. This reflects the dominance of cold, watery Yang energy manifesting in stiffness and pain in the head and neck. All manifestations of stiffness and cramps in the neck are related to dampness, reflecting the气 (qi) of the five zang organs as they present in the physical form.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Classic of the Spiritual Pivot</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Pathogenic Qi and Disease of the Organs</strong></p>
<p>When the pathogenic factor enters a person and affects the neck, it descends to the Taiyang.<br>[Note: This refers to the Taiyang&#39;s influence as it moves up the neck and affects the head and face.]</p>
<p><strong>On Diagnosis of Diseases</strong></p>
<p>When examining a person&#39;s eye sockets, if there is a slight swelling resembling a new awakening, and when the neck pulse is active, there is coughing upon pressing the hands and feet, it indicates swelling from wind water.<br>[Note: The pulse of the feet at the Taiyang originates at the two eyes and exits at the neck. The cold water from the Taiyang primarily governs this area. The Yang energy flows on the skin&#39;s surface, and thus the water mingles with the air and surges between the skin, causing slight swelling in the eye sockets. If the pulse moves and there is skin swelling accompanied by coughing, it indicates water retention in the skin, affecting the lung’s qi. Wind water arises from external exposure to wind, leading to the dispersion of water.]</p>
<p><strong>On Cold and Heat Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The five internal organs correspond to five regions of the body: the Futu (Hidden Rabbit) is one; the knee is two (the knee refers to the spleen); the back is three; the five organ points are four; and the neck is five. Anyone with a carbuncle in these five areas is bound to die.<br>[Note: Futu refers to the area of the kidneys. The knee corresponds to the spleen&#39;s region. The back relates to the lung&#39;s points. The points of the five organs are called the heart points of the five vertebrae. The neck corresponds to the liver&#39;s points. This text states: the emergence of a carbuncle does not arise from heaven or earth, but from the accumulation of subtleties. Therefore, the presence of a carbuncle in these five areas represents the gradual accumulation of toxic stagnation from the five organs, responding externally to the disharmony of blood and qi. Thus, anyone with this condition in these regions is bound to die.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

If one vein is seen, death will occur in one year; if one and a half veins are seen, death will occur in one and a half years; if two veins are seen, two years until death; if two and a half veins are seen, two and a half years until death; if three veins are seen, death will occur in three years. If the red vein does not run through the pupil, healing is possible.</p>
<p>(Note: The organ shapes of the Jue Yin and Shao Yang are located in the lower part of the heart and middle burner, and both types of energy originate from the kidneys. The pupil is the &#39;bone eye&#39; of the water organ. The red vein running up and down through the pupil signifies toxic energy of the water organ, which collides with the fire organ&#39;s toxic energy and subsequently affects the water organ&#39;s &#39;bone eye.&#39; This interaction of yin and yang leads to an incurable death. The toxicity inside the organs prevents movement and release, hence it ruptures the veins, resulting in a severe illness. The single vein signifies severe toxicity of the water organ, causing one-year death; two veins signify the toxicity spreading to the fire organ, leading to a two-year death; three veins mean the toxic energy is distributed between the two organs, causing a death after three years. The more concentrated the toxicity, the more severe the harm, thus leading to quicker death. The &#39;fraction&#39; indicates a slower death. One and a half veins fall between one and two years; two and a half veins fall between two and three years.)<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Nine Leaks</strong>  </p>
<p>When lumps appear first on the neck or armpits, they are likely to be leaks. It is advisable to avoid five pungent foods, wine, flour, and all hot dishes. These leaks resemble stone carbuncles, appearing as lumps with the cores located in both necks and under the arms, causing no pain or heat. For treatment, one should apply a powder of calcined stone externally and internally take a Five Spice and Forsythia decoction to purge them. If they have already ruptured, treat as for carbuncles. For unbroken lumps, a fire needle should be used, inserting the needle into the center of the lump for complete resolution. What are the Nine Leaks? They are: first, wolf leak; second, rat leak; third, mole cricket leak; fourth, sorcery leak; fifth, ant leak; sixth, larvae leak; seventh, floating leak; eighth, scrofula leak; ninth, turning pulse leak.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Luo Li (Scrofula)</strong></p>
<p>This condition is primarily governed by the Hand Shaoyang Sanjiao Meridian. Generally, this meridian is characterized by an abundance of qi and a deficiency of blood, arising from shock, worry, and contemplation. This disease initially manifests beneath the ear and between the neck, extending down to the jaw and into the supraclavicular fossa, appearing subtly beneath the skin. Initially, it emerges like a bean and gradually grows to resemble a plum pit, sometimes appearing as one, or three to five nodules. When pressed, they move slightly and cause mild pain; there is no fever, only a slight maturation in the afternoon or nighttime dryness in the mouth, diminished appetite, and fatigue in the limbs. They remain firm and do not rupture; when they do rupture, they do not heal, all due to insufficient qi and blood, often transforming into phthisis. Patients may feel redness and swelling that can appear above or below, to the left or right, often in clusters of three to five, rupturing and releasing pus and blood, leading to the formation of scrofula. Singular lumps are termed tubercles; those that tend to connect are referred to as scrofula. However, this condition is not caused by rich foods but rather by a combination of deficiency and stagnant qi. Therefore, it requires treatment with tonics to nourish qi and blood, allowing the sores to resolve naturally. Using harsh or drastic medicines will damage the blood and qi further and hinder recovery. If not treated promptly, it could lead to fatality.</p>
<p>Madao Chuang (Horse-Cutter Ulcer) is also governed by the Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian, which, like the Sanjiao Meridian, is characterized by an abundance of qi and a deficiency of blood. This may appear in front of or behind the ear, beneath the ear extending to the jaw, or in the chest and sides, or along the flanks, persisting firm without breaking. All of these are regarded as Madao Chuang. Thus, they are more firm than soft, with pus appearing white and resembling thin soup or dirty water. Those treating it should seek a clear liquid. If the external appearance resembles that of a clam, it is classified as Madao Chuang.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Jing Tong (Neck Pain)</strong></p>
<p>For swelling and pain in the neck, with fullness in the chest and distention in the abdomen, it indicates excess above and deficiency below, with qi stagnation and reversal. This condition has an abundance of yang qi trapped in the chest; acupuncture is not appropriate. It is advisable to take a remedy to smooth qi, like Shunqi Decoction or Xiaofuling Decoction. If there is kidney heat, symptoms will include lower back pain and soreness, thirst with a desire for hot drinks; when heat stirs, it causes pain in the neck and tightness, while the legs are cold and sore, making the person unwilling to speak. The classic states: If sweating occurs with a floating pulse, one dies; if the pulse does not respond to sweating, two die; if one speaks crazily and loses one&#39;s faculties, three die. All these result from stagnant emotions that cannot be relieved, leading to peril.</p>

<p>Lumps are what the classics refer to as tubercles. They might appear before or behind the ear, extending to the jaw, connected below to the supraclavicular fossa—these are all lumps. If present in the chest or on the side of the chest, extending down to both sides of the lower ribs, these are termed &quot;Ma Dao.&quot; The Shao Yang meridian governs these cases. This meridian has more qi than blood, hence it tends to be hard rather than soft, with pus being white and thin like rinse water. The practitioner should seek clear water for treatment. If lumps arise in other meridians, one should follow the corresponding acupuncture points as per the classic &quot;Bronze Man&quot; and use medicinal treatments according to the meridian involved. A single small lump represents a tubercle, while several connected forms are referred to as lumps; those that resemble a clam shell on the surface are called &quot;Ma Dao.&quot;<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Theory of Ming</strong><br><strong>(By Jin Cheng Wu Ji)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stiff Neck</strong></p>
<p>In cases of cold damage causing stiff neck, how can we clarify it? The Taiyang channel begins at the inner canthus of the eye, crosses over the top of the head, enters the brain, then exits down the neck, traveling along the shoulder and arm, and internally alongside the spine, reaching the waist. The classic text states: &quot;In Taiyang disease, there is stiffness and pain in the head and neck accompanied by aversion to cold.&quot; When the Taiyang channel is affected by wind and cold, the meridians become obstructed, resulting in tension in the neck and stiffness in the nape. When there is stiffness and urgency in the neck from cold damage, this indicates a Taiyang exterior syndrome; it should definitely be treated by dispersing and resolving it. In Taiyang disease, if there is stiffness in the neck and back along with sweating and aversion to wind, Gui Zhi Jia Ge Gen Tang is the main remedy. If there is stiffness in the neck and back without sweating and with aversion to wind, Ge Gen Tang is the main remedy. Both are dispersing agents. Both cases present with stiffness in the neck and back, yet their dispersal has variations in severity. The case with fever, sweating, and aversion to wind suggests an exterior deficiency; the exterior deficiency can be resolved by relaxing the muscles. The case without sweating and with aversion to wind indicates an exterior excess; in this case, we can induce sweating. Hence, the treatments differ. The formula Gui Zhi Jia Ge Gen Tang consists of Gui Zhi combined with Ma Huang and Ge Gen, while Ge Gen Tang is different.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Gui Zhi Decoction, when Ma Huang and Ge Gen are added, upon detailed examination, if there are no sweat and aversion to wind, this indicates a true excess condition, thus it is appropriate to add Ma Huang and Ge Gen to Gui Zhi Decoction to promote sweating. If sweating is present with aversion to wind, this is a sign of exterior deficiency; in cases of exterior deficiency, one can release the muscles, and it is likely that only Ge Gen should be added to Gui Zhi Decoction without Ma Huang. </p>
<p>The term &quot;Ba&quot; refers to a distinctive appearance of raising the neck. &quot;Ba&quot; also refers to a short-feathered bird. A short-feathered bird cannot soar and when it moves, it first stretches and raises its head and ears. Those with strong neck and back move in the same manner, unlike those who bend down weakly. In cases of Tai Yang injury with stiff neck and back, this may be due to a combination of Tai Yang wind and cold damp, resulting in stiffness. Spasms are also linked to neck stiffness. </p>
<p>The classics state: A patient with fever and cold feet, stiff and urgent neck, aversion to cold, occasional fever in the head, red face, and red eyes presents with dynamic head and face movements. The original text is lacking; according to the &quot;Jin Gui,&quot; for the symptoms of spasms from damp heat, the pulse changes in the second section may be altered. &quot;Yao&quot; refers to the phenomenon of suddenly closing the mouth and arching the back, indicative of spasms. The &quot;Jin Gui Yao Lue&quot; states that in Tai Yang conditions, if there is neck and back stiffness and the pulse feels deep and slow, this indicates spasms, and Gui Zhi plus (herb) Lou Decoction is the treatment. </p>
<p>Even with neck and back stiffness, the exterior symptoms in Tai Yang conditions should be completely dispersible. There is also the condition of chest binding, where the neck is similarly stiff as in spasms. In such cases, if purged, it will harmonize, and Da Xianxiong Wan should be employed. When faced with illness, carefully analyze the exterior and interior conditions; treatments may involve sweating or purging according to the symptoms, and then the treatment will be thorough.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

<p>From below the ear to the collarbone, or extending to the shoulder, sores appear hard as stone, and when moved do not have a root; this is called horse knife sores, coming from the lesser yang meridian of the hands and feet.

<p><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Method</strong> 【Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng】</p>
<p><strong>Scrofula, Tuberculosis, Goiter</strong></p>
<p>Scrofula initially arises from the lesser yang meridian; if one does not observe dietary restrictions, it will inevitably extend to the yangming meridian. In general, the excessiveness of food flavors and the accumulation of stagnant qi, referred to as toxin, wind, and heat, all stem from these three aspects and must differentiate between deficiency and excess. The excess type is indeed easy to treat; however, unless one completely avoids rich and gas-producing foods, it remains difficult and quite concerning. As it pertains to the gallbladder meridian, it governs decisions, possessing mutual fire with more qi and less blood.

<p><strong>Treatment for Lymphatic Tumors</strong></p>
<p>The disease of lymphatic tumors has many names. The &quot;Chao&#39;s Disease Sources&quot; records thirty-six types, while the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; and &quot;Holy Virtue&quot; texts discuss nine types. Generally, it is said to differ due to wind poison, heat poison, or air poison. The lymphatic nodules arise from the contrast of cold and heat, fundamentally caused by anger and suppressed feelings, excessive worry, and the invasion of wind and heat evils attacking the liver. Anger harms the liver, which governs the tendons, causing them to swell and accumulate. Symptoms often arise in areas between the neck and armpits, forming clusters that start as small as a bean and later grow to the size of a plum pit, interconnected and varying in size. Initially, there may be chills followed by fever, and strong pain in the throat and neck. If the swelling does not subside, one should promptly take Five Spices and Forsythia Decoction or Oysters and Rhubarb Decoction to clear three or two passages. Additionally, apply Ten Fragrance Ointment and Black Rhinoceros Ointment on top, and when employing the Abscess-Draining Decoction or Toxic Soothing Decoction, continue to drain if needed.

<p><strong>Luo Li (Scrofula)</strong></p>
<p>The disease of scrofula is caused by the stagnation and obstruction of blood and Qi, rooted in the organs. It often manifests as lumps on the neck, varying in size, accompanied by intermittent fever and chills, with pus and blood oozing out. Sometimes one lump subsides while another appears. It is advisable to consume rice drink mixed with powdered桂 (cinnamon) and滑石 (talc) of two qian (a unit of measure) every other night. When the morning bell rings, take the black and white powder; it will definitely produce substances resembling grape flesh, which will exit through urine in several pieces, leading to the resolution of the swollen masses. Additionally, regularly take the Siqi Decoction with added 香木 (fragrant wood) or the Suzi Decoction for relieving Qi.  </p>
<p>Those lumps encircling the neck, commonly referred to as &quot;coiling snake scrofula,&quot; are difficult to treat. First, grind 石菖蒲 (Acorus calamus) into a paste, slightly break the skin of the affected area, and then burn cat&#39;s fur to ash, mixing it with scented oil to apply on the affected place. A powdered white蔹 (a type of medicinal herb), taken mixed with wine, is very effective. It is also beneficial to take a sip of wine and apply the white powder onto the affected area. Utilizing fresh specimens is especially good. Alternatively, mixing water from a pig&#39;s gall bladder with powdered雄黄 (realgar) and applying it to the affected area is also effective.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

<p>The early description states: Scrofula commonly appears on the shoulders and neck, sometimes red, sometimes white, sometimes hard, sometimes soft. Initially, it resembles a bean; over time, it becomes like a seed. As time passes, it may grow as large as a plum or an egg and can appear in clusters, sometimes in pairs or threes, or as many as six or seven. This is often referred to as &quot;coiled snake scrofula.&quot; Symptoms include effort and anxiety, which lead to phlegm, pain, and redness, warranting early treatment as the best option. </p>
<p>For flowing scrofula, which is more often found in women, its nature is impatient, with stagnant energy and a persistent mind. Initially appearing on the neck, once it breaks, pus flows to the limbs and causes body-wide toxicity, resembling plums or plums. If untreated, it may burst on its own, creating openings through which cold and hot pain occurs or pus flows, thus it is named flowing scrofula, also referred to as &quot;thousand-year sores.&quot; It is advisable to take the &quot;Tuo Li Jiu Ku Shen Ying Wan&quot; (Pill to Rescue from Suffering); if the pulse is strong, first use &quot;Zhui Shen San&quot; (Pursuing Spirit Powder) before taking the Rescue Pill.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<p>Yang toxins in the six fu organs gather at the crown, specifically ruled by the Sun Meridian Bladder. If it occurs at the back of the neck, the sore has a head pointing upwards and a tail pointing downwards, resembling a honeycomb, which is a sign of a reversal. In cases of swelling and pain, one should urgently use &quot;Tuo Li San&quot; with the additions of &quot;Sheng Ma,&quot; &quot;Chi Shao,&quot; and &quot;Jie Geng&quot; to ward off toxins attacking the heart. If phlegm emerges or flows into both shoulders, it is untreatable. </p>
<p>If a sore arises directly behind the head, it is termed &quot;Yao Ju,&quot; appearing large, dark purple or black; urgent treatment is unnecessary. Heat penetrates into the deep fluids, damaging the Ren channel and internally burning the liver and lungs, leading to death within ten days. </p>
<p>For painful swelling, with thirst and a preference for cold water, one should use detoxifying soup with &quot;Tian Hua Fen&quot; to eliminate phlegm, heat, and dampness; or use &quot;Huang Lian Xiao Du San,&quot; &quot;Dang Gui Qiang Huo Tang,&quot; &quot;Qing Re Xiao Du Yin,&quot; or &quot;Huo Ming Yin&quot; as options. </p>
<p>For swelling and pain with dry mouth and thirst, with a preference for hot soup, it may indicate kidney Yang deficiency with fiery heat, for which one should use &quot;Tuo Li Xiao Du San,&quot; &quot;Tuo Li Yi Qi Tang,&quot; &quot;Shen Qi Wan,&quot; or &quot;Ba Wei Wan.&quot; If there is diffuse swelling, slight pain, and reduced appetite, use &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang.&quot; If there is excessive phlegm, use &quot;Tuo Li Qing Zhong Tang.&quot; However, if it appears dark and does not rupture or respond, it indicates depletion of Yin essence, termed &quot;Nao Shuo,&quot; and is untreatable.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

<p>Luo Li appears at the front side of the neck, forming lumps like large beans or ginkgo nuts; it is called Luo Li. Ma Dao develops in the chest, abdomen, and underarms, hard as stone, resembling the shape of a horse knife worm; it is called Ma Dao. These conditions arise from the pathogen of qi deficiency and blood deficiency, which originates from the lesser yang fire of the hands and feet. The areas before and behind the ears and at the shoulder blades belong to the lower limb lesser yang; extending to the chin, neck, cheeks, and jaw pertains to the upper limb yang brightness; if it extends to the central chest, specifically to the Zhongfu and Yunmen areas of the lung meridian, it results in death. </p>
<p>Wind-induced lumps are sharp and small; heat-induced lumps are swollen and red, also known as blood lumps or phlegm lumps, which are pushed and soft; qi lumps are round and mobile; there are also mouse remnants, varying in size. Without phlegm, there can be no lumps. For the initial emergence of all luo, those that are solid are primarily treated by transforming phlegm, commonly using the Erchen Decoction with added Fangfeng, Jiegeng, Huangqin, and Zhuli.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ancient method known as the White Snake Powder treats scrofula that has developed into an ulcer. It contains Qian Niu, which can benefit the kidney meridian by eliminating harmful moisture and preventing excessive drainage through openings. However, it must be adjusted according to the individual&#39;s condition, avoiding excessive wine, lust, and greed. </p>
<p>For women with irregular menstruation or amenorrhea without tidal fever, treatment is possible, but if there is tidal fever or coughing with amenorrhea, it is often fatal. The ancient method employs the Jade Candle Powder to treat scrofula and regulate blood flow. Taking it will lead to self-healing, with a daily dose showing results within seven to eight days. For those not experiencing amenorrhea, the Chai Hu Decoction for Menstrual Regulation and the Sheng Ma Decoction for Menstrual Adjustment are recommended. For long-standing deficiencies, add the Modified Xiao Yao Powder or the Qing Gan Yi Rong Decoction, or use the Er Chen Decoction combined with the Si Wu Decoction, adding ingredients like oyster shell, Chai Hu, Huang Qin, Yuan Shen, and Shen Qu, ground into a powder, mixed with mulberry syrup to form pills the size of mung beans. Take fifty pills with warm wine, or opt for the Shen Qi Pills for even better results.</p>
<p>Scrofula is a hallmark of ulcerative diseases, and thus diseases of the lungs indicate that if there are lumps in the abdomen or nodes on the neck, they are particularly difficult to treat, especially when they develop into ulcers. One must clear the heat and nourish the kidney and spleen. If a patient does not maintain a calm mind and light diet, they risk profuse sweating, thirst, and diarrhea, leading to severe complications. By observing the eyes, if several red veins cross the pupil, one can estimate the years until death. If the complexion is pale, with a strong pulse, it indicates profound deficiency of vital energy and is considered untreatable. Hence, it is said that real excess can be treated, but true deficiency should be approached with caution.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Phlegm Nodules</p>
<p>Nodules in the neck are neither red nor painful, do not form pus, and can be moved when pushed; these are phlegm accumulations that do not disperse. It is inappropriate to hastily use medications for scrofula. Treatment should be a modified Erchen Decoction with Dahuang (rhubarb), Lianqiao (forsythia), Chaihu (bulbous chive), and Jiegeng (platycodon). For those with a thin physique, modify the Erchen Decoction by adding Jiegeng, Huangqin (scutellaria), Yuanshen (root of the Chinese peony), Mai Men Dong (ophiopogon), and a little Fangfeng (siler), along with Zhuli (bamboo juice); frequent intake helps dissolve the nodules. </p>
<p>If there are lumps behind the ears or between the neck, each with one nodule, they should be dissolved with a Dan (pills). Nodules in the arms, or causing slight pain, are due to the absence of pus; thus, although swollen, they are not red. This also applies to those appearing on the back or shoulders. The remedy should include Chenpi (dried tangerine peel), Banxia (pinellia), Fuling (poria), Fangfeng (siler), and Jiuqin (wine-forged forsythia), each a qian (a unit of weight), with Lianqiao (forsythia) two qians, and Zaojiao (soapberry) one and a half qians, along with Chuanxiong (ligusticum) and Cangzhu (atractylodes) each five fen (a smaller unit of weight), and Gancao (licorice) three fen, brewed in water for consumption. </p>
<p>Generally, if there are lumps all over the body, they are often due to phlegm accumulation. In the upper body, they often accompany wind-heat, while in the lower body, they usually accompany damp-heat. It is advisable to add flavors to Xiaowei Decoction and use Zhuli (bamboo juice) to move phlegm, adjusting the dosage according to one&#39;s condition of deficiency or excess; Kelp Pills are also commonly used.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

<p>Goiter is formed by the combination of phlegm and qi. When tendons and veins are visible, it is called tendon goiter; when there are interwoven red veins, it is blood goiter; when the skin color remains unchanged, it is flesh goiter; when it fluctuates with worries and sorrows, it is qi goiter; and when it is hard and immovable, it is stone goiter. These five names correspond to different types. It relates to the five organs and is treated similarly to tumors. </p>
<p>Its shape resembles a cherry, with one side larger and drooping like a hammer, and the skin is wide and not tight. It arises from worries and troubles, hence it is also called goiter qi; it resembles what is now referred to as a shadow sac. Worries and anger deplete the heart and lungs, so it often appears on the neck and shoulders. Evil qi from exertion takes advantage of the body&#39;s deficiencies to manifest.</p>
<p>It can be either soft or hard, and there is no pain or itchiness. For solid types, use Hai Zao San Jian Wan or Hai Dai Wan; for abundant phlegm and fire, use Shi Zhang San or Shen Xiao Kai Jie San. These are all remedies to transform phlegm, move qi, and break down hardness, and those who have been ill for a long time should not take them rashly.</p>

<p>Scrofula is a disease associated with the Sanjiao (Triple Burner), liver and gallbladder meridians, characterized by anger, heat, dryness of the blood, or linked to the liver and kidney meridians with depletion of essence and blood, leading to internal heat. It may also arise from excessive anger, anxiety, and overthinking, combined with pathogenic heat and wind that impede the liver. Anger harms the liver, which governs the muscles; when the liver is affected, the muscles become knotted and tense. Symptoms often appear in front of and behind the ears, as well as in the armpits, forming lumps. Initially, there is a dislike of cold and a hatred of heat, with pain in the throat and neck. If there is a cold-heat sensation with pain, this indicates heat in the liver and a related qi condition; for treatment, use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction to clear liver heat, along with Jia Wei Si Wu Decoction to nourish liver blood. If the cold and heat have subsided but the lumps persist, it indicates dryness and heat in the liver meridian leading to blood issues; in this case, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San to clear liver heat and Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to replenish kidney water.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

If it has not healed after a long time, or if it heals but recurs, with pus flowing freely and the body becoming emaciated, one must use purely restorative medicines to consolidate; otherwise, it may turn into a complex condition like fistulas. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: a sinking pulse is indicative of a fistula, lingering between the flesh layers, which is this disease. Externally apply soybean cakes and amber ointment to dispel cold evils and replenish Yang energy; internally, take the &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction&quot; or Six Flavor Pill to nourish kidney water, strengthen liver wood, and fortify spleen earth, which may also lead to healing. Generally, tuberculosis in the liver and gallbladder, regardless of size, is indicated by a tight pulse at the left guan and a rapid pulse at the left chi, suggesting that kidney water cannot generate liver wood, leading to liver fire drying and muscle cramps.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text &quot;Bing Ji&quot; states: Tuberculosis is not caused by a transformation of hot conditions from rich foods or fire toxins, but rather arises from deficiencies and stagnation of qi. It is appropriate to nourish the body, boost qi, and regulate the meridians, allowing the sores to dissipate naturally; this is achieved not only by sweating them out. If pulse and symptom patterns are not precisely identified, recklessly purging may offend the meridians and lead to disaster—especially if the pulse is strong and large, indicating a deficiency of the original qi, which signifies incurability; if the face is pale, it shows metal restraining wood and also indicates no cure; if there are red veins seen in the eyes, especially several, it suggests imminent death in a few years. To treat without addressing the root causes and arbitrarily using liver-clearing medications is misguided. For clearing the liver can first harm the spleen; if the spleen is damaged, it undermines the source of the five organs, which must be approached with caution. </p>
<p>For a burning and swollen pulse that is deep and rapid, it indicates strong evil qi, and thus, should be drained. If there is swelling and pain with aversion to cold, fever, or rigidity, the evil resides on the surface and should be released. If anger leads to swelling or pain, or fever, it is advisable to soothe the liver and promote qi flow.

<p><strong>Stiffness and Pain in the Neck</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of stiffness and pain in the neck are often caused by external pathogenic factors invading the three Yang meridians. Cold causes the tendons to tighten, while wind allows them to relax; pain on the left side is often related to blood, while pain on the right is usually associated with phlegm. Stiffness and pain in the neck, accompanied by fever and aversion to cold, with a pulse that is floating and tight, indicate that wind and cold are invading the three Yang meridians, and a dispelling evil decoction is advisable.</p>
<p>If the neck is stiff and painful with slight movement, and the pulse is wiry and rapid, with greater severity on the right side, it indicates phlegm heat affecting the three Yang meridians, and a decoction to dissipate wind and resolve phlegm should be used. If stiffness and pain occur with slight movement, and the pulse is wiry and weak, with greater severity on the left side, it indicates blood deficiency and evil affecting the Taiyang and Yangming meridians, warranting a decoction to disperse wind and nourish blood.</p>
<p>If the neck is stiff and there are alternating chills and fever, along with symptoms such as vomiting or pain in the flank, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction or Sheng Ma and Fang Jing Decoction is recommended. For severe stiffness, akin to a feeling of breaking in the waist, add a modified Sheng Shi Decoction. If there is a lack of mental energy or inability to sleep, with swollen and tense neck muscle, avoid sweet and warm foods, and a bitter-cold nourishing the spirit decoction is indicated.</p>
<p>In cases where neck pain is not caused by wind evil, but rather by Qi stagnation, it is also possible for it to result from sleeping improperly, and in such cases, He Qi Decoction should be taken after meals. Many people suffer from trauma, excessive sitting, or improper sleeping position leading to neck stiffness, primarily due to kidney deficiency failing to nourish the liver, resulting in weak liver function unable to support the tendons, which can disrupt the mechanisms of movement; therefore, taking Liu Wei Di Huang Wan regularly is advised.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

According to &quot;Jiyuan,&quot; lymphadenitis sores result from different types of wind poison, heat poison, and qi poison; the lymphadenitis tumors exhibit varied cold and heat symptoms. These conditions arise from excessive anger and emotional distress, with wind and heat evils attacking the liver. Anger harms the liver, which governs the tendons, causing them to contract, accumulate, and swell. The symptoms often manifest between the neck, chest, and flanks, forming clusters that initially resemble bean-sized lumps and later grow to look like plums or dates, interconnected in varying sizes.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment Method</strong></p>
<p>For the treatment regimen, if a patient initially experiences chills, intense heat, strong pain in the throat and neck, with swelling that does not subside, use the Qianghuo Lianqiao Decoction. Additionally, regular consumption of the Xiaoyao Wan (Happy Wanderer Pill) is advisable. Furthermore, puncture the area with a needle to draw out blood; use the Baodu Decoction for hot washes, five to seven times a day. Perform needling five to seven times as well, placing a small amount of toad venom powder at the needle site and covering it with amber balm. Over time, this will lead to natural resolution. If it does not recede, use an iron tube to apply the detox ointment, then remove necrotic tissue with a lower-grade medicinal pellet, which can be used for ulcer treatment. Apply ten xuan powder or similar substances for this. If toxins attack the heart causing vomiting, use powdered milk and detoxifying powders. This should be paired with acupuncture methods. If there is an ulcer that does not heal, the Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction or Ba Shi Wu Decoction with additional Chai Hu, Di Gu Pi, Xia Ku Cao, Fu Zi, and Bei Mu should be taken frequently for efficacy. Whenever using pellet medicines, it is crucial to take along the detoxifying agents. </p>
<p>For redness, swelling, and pain with a deep, rapid pulse, it indicates substantial pathogenic influence; thus, it should be expelled to transform toxins, reduce swelling, harmonize the interior, and adjust accordingly. If there is swelling, pain, chills, heat, or tension with a floating, rapid pulse, it indicates the evil is at the surface; therefore, disperse the exterior using Jing Fang Bai Du with adjustments. If swelling, pain, or fever arises from anger, promote liver qi and alleviate stagnation using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Qing Pi, Qing Mu Xiang, Hong Hua, and Tao Ren added. If the swelling is hard and unulcerated, tonify qi and blood with Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction. If it stems from repression, resolve stagnation and regulate qi and blood with Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

For cases caused by deficiency and overstrain, it is necessary to support first with the Supplement Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction, then follow with Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction with adjustments. When there is a rupture that does not heal, due to decay combined with the need for nourishment, use a needle to treat the decay and supplement with the Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction. If the pulse is strong and does not close or resolve, treat with Qianghuo Lianqiao Decoction. For swelling and pain accompanied by chills and fever and constipation, use Qianghuo Lianqiao Decoction, followed by the Divine Immortal Life-Saving Drink. For submandibular swollen and painful lymph nodes with chills and fever, use Jingfang Baituo Powder; once the exterior condition subsides, use the Swelling Dispersal and Hardening Dissolution Decoction. If after a rupture the mass does not decay, apply the Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction, while also using the needle to disperse the decay. If the swelling is hard and long-lasting without suppuration, and not responding to dispersing hardening Baituo medicine, it is advisable to moxibust the tip of the elbow and shoulder, while taking the Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction for resolution. For those with robust qi and blood, if the pulse is deep, full, and large without feeling diminished, one can take Biuxiao San and Wuxian Wubi Pill to eliminate toxins. If the toxin responds, stop these two medicines and continue with the Benefit Qi and Nourish Essence Decoction for regulation. If the wound edges do not close, it is appropriate to apply a bean curd cake for moxibustion and use amber ointment and Ten Fragrance Ointment as a dressing. If there is fever after needling, restlessness, and thirst with a large and weak pulse, it indicates blood deficiency; one should use the Danggui Blood Nourishment Decoction, then follow with Shengyu Decoction, and additionally Bawei Decoction with Fritillaria and Polygala.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Abscess of the Neck</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: What about an abscess that forms under the back of the neck? The answer: This is known as a “mouth sore,” and it is associated with the Governor Vessel. When Yang is overly abundant, and the Qi is excessive, the fire rises and causes the abscess to form. One should urgently take Wujin San and Shengjindan for sweating; for those who are robust, one pellet of Jindan should be taken. If delayed, pus will flow out; if it leads to convulsions due to wind, it is difficult to treat. If there is toxic evil blocking with violent surges of fresh blood, it can lead to death. If the poison attacks the heart and abdomen, causing bloating and delirium, it also results in death. This condition, with red, swollen pain, can be treated; however, if the root is large and spirit is confused, it is difficult to cure. Assess the balance of deficiency and excess to induce sweating and down regulate internally, while using external powerful medicaments to contain it; apply medicinal paste like Liu Huai Gao to break and drain the poison, ensuring the root is not lost. If it spreads to the shoulders and back, do not treat. Some suggest first taking the Pursuing Sore and Life-Depriving Decoction for two applications, followed by the Blood-Activating and Toxic-Cleansing Decoction.</p>

The answer: This is called Tianzhu abscess. Urgently apply garlic moxibustion to relieve the itch; if garlic is unavailable, bright moxibustion can also treat it. Take Lifesaving Decoction with Qiang Huo and Jie Geng added. Select suitable Wujin San and Shengjindan. If blisters form after moxibustion, it is auspicious; if no blisters form, it is ominous. If sweating is achieved with a sweating remedy, it can be treated; without sweating, it is difficult to treat. If it becomes rotten with confusion, nausea, vomiting, and continuous bleeding, it leads to death.</p>

<p><strong>Surgical Authenticity</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong]</p>
<p><strong>On Brain Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Brain abscesses are commonly referred to as &quot;Dui Kou.&quot; However, their manifestations differ, having two sources. If acquired from a combination of dampness and heat, through external invasion, it is lighter; if arising from internal organ stagnation that manifests externally, it is more severe. Why is this? The illness of dampness and heat arises from the climate, where cold and heat are not balanced, seasonal temperature changes are irregular, and yin and yang are out of harmony. Those with a weak constitution are easily invaded. Although the area behind the neck belongs to the Governor Vessel, it also governs the pathway of solar cold and water; all invasions cause qi and blood to stagnate, and stagnation leads to swelling. This is the case when acquired externally. When the illness first arises, there is pain at the onset, often appearing at critical points, with rapid heat and pain in the first few days, sometimes accompanied by chills and fever. The mouth feels dry yet is not parched, the color is red with active roots, the ulcer raises gradually in severity, the shape is not diffuse or large, the pain comes and goes, and it is prone to pus and corruption. The ability to taste food remains, and there are no significant changes in appetite or activity. Although the external symptoms may seem fearsome, if there are no signs of the seven evils, this belongs to yang conditions, and since it arises from external sources, it often can resolve without treatment.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>All the internal organs that accumulate and become heavy have five sources: First, the heart governs blood, so when the heart is disturbed, it leads to restlessness and excessive heat, causing swelling as it interacts with cold water in the neck. Second, the liver regulates the tendons, and when anger injures the liver, it affects the blood vessels, resulting in a lack of nourishment for the tendons, which can lead to swelling. If the problem is not resolved, the skin may show a dark purple color, and it may feel hard and swollen. If it ruptures, blood and foul water may flow without pain or pus, indicating liver qi injury. Third, the spleen governs the muscles, so worries harm the spleen. As spleen qi declines or if rich foods affect the stomach, this can result in stagnation in the middle jiao, preventing qi from circulating and leading to swelling, where the outer skin may appear rotten but the inside remains hard and unruptured, accompanied by dry mouth and tongue, inability to eat, and foul discharge. These signs indicate spleen qi injury.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lungs govern the skin and hair, thus melancholy harms the lungs. When the lungs are injured, the pores close, the channels become obstructed, and the qi cannot flow smoothly. Stagnation throughout the meridians leads to swelling, with ulcers often appearing flat and depressed, having a pale and unremarkable color. The skin may become rotten and greasy like spilled soup, breathing becomes coarse and short, the face appears dull and the nose congested, leading to excessive phlegm and persistent coughing. These symptoms all indicate injury to lung qi.</p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bones and marrow, thus excessive desires harm the kidneys. When the kidneys are injured, the true yin energy becomes depleted. Once the true yin fails, the fire of true yang arises on its own, which can fluctuate up and down, in motion or stillness, causing distress to the internal organs, consuming the body fluids, altering appearance and voice. The ulcers have a purple-black coloration, with a rapid and irregular pulse, restlessness and dry mouth, leading to thirst with drinking. These symptoms all indicate injury to kidney qi.</p>
<p>In treating these conditions, one must first distinguish between deficiency and excess internally, and between yin and yang externally. One must align with seasonal changes, observing the pathology. If a sore has not yet formed after seven days, the channels should be opened to induce sweating. If seven days have passed and the condition has established itself, treatment must include both supplementation and drainage. This approach prevents internal toxicity and external transformation of symptoms.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the medicinal attack on the excess of pathogens is too intense, the vital energy will be harmed, and the toxins will be difficult to eliminate. If one applies cooling medicines, the qi and blood freeze and凝凝, causing the flesh to die and becoming difficult to ulcerate. I have treated this condition, as well as early-stage back eruptions, by inserting a bamboo needle at the apex directly into the painful spot to expel the foul blood, opening the wound channels, and then inserting toad venom sticks until reaching the bottom of the sore, covering with medicated ointment externally. Internally, I prescribe the Universal Elixir or toad venom pills to induce profuse sweating and dissipate the internal toxins. The next day, the swelling might subside, with or without pain; continue the insertion and application until the swelling rises and a root-like protrusion appears with surrounding cracks filled with pus, at which point stop the needle insertion. For mild cases, after nine days, the hardened disease root will be expelled. In cases of severe toxicity where it cannot fall off immediately, it may gradually rot into pus, a good method for converting the severe into the mild. Use the Jade Red Ointment externally to help with flesh growth and internally take supplements to consolidate and contain; the issue will likely heal on its own soon. For light and shallow Yang conditions, wait for natural ulceration without the use of needle techniques. If it is painless and not swollen, even if moxibustion is applied without discomfort, this indicates a Yin condition, which should be addressed swiftly without delay; this is an important method for resolving deep-rooted issues that manifest superficially.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　夫瘰疬者，有风毒、热毒、气毒之异，又有瘰疬、筋疬、痰疬之殊。风毒者，外受风寒，缚于经络，其患先寒后热，结核浮肿。热毒者，天时亢热，暑中三阳，或内食膏粱厚味，酿结成患，色红微热，结核坚肿。气毒者，四时杀厉之气感冒而成，其患耳项胸腋骤成肿块，令人寒热头眩，项强作痛。瘰疬者，累累如贯珠，连接三五枚，此不作作　原作「足」，据《外科正宗》瘰疬论改。<a id="orig-53p" href="#trans-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Scrofula</strong></p>
<p>Scrofula, which has variations of wind poisons, heat poisons, and qi poisons, also has distinctions among scrofula, muscle scrofula, and phlegm scrofula. Wind poison arises from exposure to wind and cold, binding in the meridians, where the condition first presents with cold followed by heat, resulting in swollen nodules. Heat poison occurs in excessively hot weather, during the height of summer, or from consuming rich foods, leading to red and slightly warm colors with firm, swollen nodules. Qi poison develops from the harshness of seasonal changes, resulting in sudden swelling in areas such as the ears, neck, chest, and armpits, causing chills, fever, dizziness, and pain in the neck. Scrofula appears clustered like strings of pearls, with connections of three to five lumps.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Cold and heat derive from consuming unclean remnants left by insects, ants, and mice, or from sweat mixed with old tea and stale water. The affliction starts small and gradually becomes serious; initially, there is no pain, but over time it becomes noticeable. </p>
<p>Muscle knots, or &quot;Jin Li,&quot; arise from sorrowful thoughts and explosive anger, which harm the liver. Since the liver governs the muscles, it causes them to contract, forming hard knots that appear between the neck and muscles, resembling the hardness of chess pieces, varying in size, some recessed and others protruding. Over time, they can become hollow and produce both cold and heat; excessive labor and anger worsen the condition.</p>
<p>Phlegm knots arise from improper regulation of food and drink, instability in hunger and satiety, and fluctuating emotions, leading to an inability of the spleen to transport and transform, resulting in phlegm accumulation. Initially, it resembles small plums or cherries on the body, turning slightly red over time, and eventually rupturing, which makes it easier to contain.</p>
<p>In observing these symptoms, one should identify the wind and toxin; to disperse the wind and eliminate the toxin, remedies like &quot;Fang Feng Jie Du Tang&quot; are effective. For heat toxin, it is necessary to cleanse the spleen and drain the heat, using formulas such as &quot;Lian Qiao Xiao Du Yin.&quot;<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Men should avoid symptoms like blue veins on the forehead, hot flashes with cough, and excessive sweating. Women should avoid having red threads in the eyes, irregular menstruation, and a feeling of heat in the bones, along with restlessness in their hearts. If either men or women experience these symptoms, they may later develop difficult-to-treat tuberculosis. However, those with sufficient vitality in the early stages may take herbs to disperse swelling and soften nodules; about 30-40% may find relief. If one is not aware of their condition and uses strong doses recklessly, it may damage vital energy, leading to severe illnesses—this is often not the patient&#39;s fate but rather results from the actions of the physician. I often treat early-stage nodules; if previous medications are ineffective, I use needles to pierce the nodule deeply, inserting a thin strip of ice powder and sealing it with paper. After approximately 14 days, the nodule will naturally fall out, and applying red and black plasters along with internal tonics usually leads to recovery in no time. I have also frequently observed that using substances like rashes, morning glories, and certain purgative herbs has often led to severe outcomes; thus, one should exercise caution with them.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the initial symptoms are swelling and pain, with aversion to cold and strong heat, limbs feeling tense, stiff neck, and dizziness, it is advisable to disperse these symptoms. For hard swelling with heat, constipation, dry mouth, uncomfortable feeling in the chest, nausea, and a strong pulse, one should promote bowel movements. Accumulated heat from rich foods and strong wines, as well as damp phlegm leading to stagnation, should be transformed to clear heat and resolve phlegm. Overthinking and excessive worry harm the liver, causing retraction and knots, so nourishing blood and releasing stagnant emotions is advised. If there is exhaustion from sexual activity, Yin deficiency with evening heat, spontaneous sweating, coughing, and emaciation, one should nourish the kidneys and strengthen the spleen. Those who feel lost and forgetful, with pent-up emotions and obsessive thoughts, find themselves separated from yin and yang, suffering from the passage of time, will injure both essence and blood. First, nourish the righteous Qi, then treat the superficial condition. Firm yet not collapsing, decayed yet not rotting; rotting yet not healing, supplement and heal it. These are all methods of revitalization.</p>
<p>As for &quot;Luo Chuan,&quot; it is a condition resulting from consuming mouse-eaten food, which many do not realize leads to this illness. However, those with stagnant Qi may easily develop it and find it difficult to cure. The prescription includes three taels each of white peony, white mustard seed, purple-backed celestial vine, poria, cyperus, and angelica, five qian each of ginseng and bupleurum, one tael of dandelion, five taels of white atractylodes, and two qian of amomum, ground into powder. Make into pills the size of a small grain of rice, taking three qian with white boiling water three times daily; in a month it will dissipate, and in two months it will be completely cured.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

Grind them into a fine powder and apply to the necrotic flesh. If the sore is small, apply directly to the sore itself, allowing the flesh to slough off naturally. Additionally, apply a medicinal plaster to facilitate the removal of flesh.

<li>Ginseng (Renshen) 3 fen: Nourishes lung qi, especially for shortness of breath or unregulated panting; add half a qian of True Reed (Zhenloulu), do not substitute with White-headed Crane (Baitouweng).</li>
<li>Cimicifuga (Shengma) 1 qian.</li>
<li>Kudzu root (Gegen) 0.5 qian: These three herbs correspond to the Yangming channel and are essential.</li>
<li>Licorice (Gancao) 0.5 qian: Harmonizes the middle, balances all other ingredients, dispels fire, and benefits the stomach.</li>
<li>Forsythia (Lianqiao) 1 qian: This herb is indispensable for wounds in the twelve channels; it disperses blood stasis and gathers qi—an essential medicine for wounds.</li>
<li>Moutan bark (Danpi) 2 fen: Eliminates stagnant blood in the intestines and stomach.</li>
<li>Cooked Rehmannia (Shudihuang) 3 fen: These three ingredients among the channels harmonize, generate, and cool blood.</li>
<li>Angelica root (Danggui) 3 fen.</li>
<li>Fresh Rehmannia (Shengdi) 3 fen.</li>
<li>White Peony (Baishao) 3 fen: Increase the dosage in summer; it has a sour taste and cold properties, capable of replenishing and benefiting qi, treating abdominal pain. Do not use during cold conditions in winter.</li>
<li>Cinnamon (Rougui) 3 fen: Very pungent and warm, it dispels lumps and stagnation. Use sparingly for cold conditions affecting ulcers; this action is intended for conditions where cold arises from heat.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></li>

Three parts of Xuan; these two ingredients are for very hard sores; do not use if not hard. One qian each of Qianghuo, Duhuo, and Fangfeng; these three must address the hand and foot Taiyang symptoms, spine pain, and stiffness in the neck, where one cannot look back, and the waist feels like it&#39;s broken and the neck feels like it&#39;s pulled. Fangfeng is hot and pungent; if the sore is above the diaphragm, even without Taiyang symptoms, it should still be used to dispel congestion and upper body wind evil. Two parts of Shenqu, fried, for those with undigested food. Two parts of Yizhiren; if there is excessive salivation, it indicates stomach disharmony or vomiting saliva and food; if there is cold in the stomach, add this; if not, do not use. One qian of Malt, for digestion and strengthening the spleen. Three parts of Huangbo, fried; if there is heat or weakness in the legs, add this. If one feels restless and wants to remove their clothes, this indicates concealed fire in the stomach, so it’s advisable to add this. Three parts of Huanglian, fried; it treats irritability.

<p>All these should be ground into a very fine powder. Take two eggs, remove the yolk, and mix with the medicinal powder using clear water, then put it back into the shells. Cover the openings with damp paper multiple times and steam until cooked. Afterward, dry and grind into powder. For those with a deficiency, take 0.5 qian per dose; for those with a surplus, take 1 qian, mixed with ginger wine at the fifth watch (around 4-5 AM). If one feels pain in the lower abdomen, take a dose of Yiyuan powder, and the toxins will be expelled through bowel movements. Pregnant women should not take this. </p>
<p>After the toxins have been eliminated, it is advisable to consume the Qi-nourishing and vitality-restoring decoction frequently, which will help the sores heal naturally. According to the essential formula, when treating scrofula with the Effective Powder, it should be alternated with the Gua Lou Powder for remarkable efficacy. </p>
<p>Those who indiscriminately use the Effective Powder without considering whether there is deficiency or surplus should be aware that the pill bug is very potent, has great toxicity, promotes urination, and breaks blood, significantly draining the vital essence. If a person is surplus and uses this to attack it, then supplements may follow to restore health; however, if a person is deficient and this is used, even if the stagnant flesh is removed, the sores may not heal and the situation could worsen.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To make the medicine for alleviating suffering, namely the &quot;Rescue from Suffering Pills,&quot; for treating flowing ulcer:</p>
<p>Prepare the following ingredients: </p>
<ul>
<li>Skinless Chuanwu (aconite), 5 taels,</li>
<li>Angelica wine soaked overnight, </li>
<li>Myrrh,</li>
<li>Bai Zhi (angelica dahurica), </li>
<li>Aged tangerine peel, each 1 tael,</li>
<li>Licorice, 1 tael,</li>
<li>Ginger, half tael,</li>
<li>Cicada slough, washed with water, half tael,</li>
<li>Soap pod, 7 pieces, peeled and strung.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crush the soap pod and add 4 large bowls of water, boil down to 2 large bowls. Strain to remove the residue, and use the liquid to cook Chuanwu and other aconite until they become soft enough to mash into a paste. The remaining herbs should be powdered separately and mixed with the aconite paste to form pills the size of a tung seed. Each time, take 60 pills, using peppermint tea regardless of hunger or fullness. </p>
<p>If the ulcer has already burst, make perforations where the swelling occurs, which may be as large as a finger, either black or white. This is due to the wind and qi clashing, so it is advisable to use a remedy to dispel wind and regulate the flow of qi, particularly the &quot;Transform Qi and Regulate Menstruation Decoction.&quot;</p>
<p>This decoction should be taken in between doses of the &quot;Rescue from Suffering Pills&quot; for treating flowing ulcers. Ingredients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xiangfuzi (cyperus) soaked in wine overnight and then dried under the sun,</li>
<li>Qianghuo and Bai Zhi, each 1 tael,</li>
<li>Fire-calcined oyster,</li>
<li>Licorice,</li>
<li>Tiannohua fen (unicorn plant powder) and soap thorn, each half tael,</li>
<li>Tangerine peel, 2 taels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grind these into a fine powder, and take 2 qian at a time using warm water, not limited by time, three times daily. If the pulse is strong, first take the &quot;Chase Toxic Deity Decoction,&quot; followed by the &quot;Rescue from Suffering Pills.&quot;<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a></p></div>

<p>Collect three bowls each of wheat straw ash, mulberry wood ash, and mineral lime, and one shao (a small cup) of charcoal ash. Mix these four ashes thoroughly, using a wine strainer and plugging the opening with a cotton cloth. Boil 30 bowls of water and pour in the ash mixture, then boil the liquid again, pour it in once more, to extract the medicinal properties, and simmer it in a clay pot over a slow fire. Seal the pot tightly with paper, and reduce the mixture down until only one bowl remains. While it is still hot, add mineral lime powder and stir it until it reaches a paste-like consistency. Then, add yellow lead until it turns a faint reddish color, sealing the pot tightly and letting it cool. The next day, the thick substance in the clay pot should be stored with the opening sealed tightly. Use a small amount for applying on top of the affected area, immediately piercing through. If it does not blacken, apply again, aiming for a blackened appearance. If the medicine is dry, mix it with saliva for application. If urgent, simply use nine bowls of large firewood ash and three bowls of lime, prepare the ash juice as before and boil it down to a thick consistency.

<p>For children with weak necks caused by wind deficiency, take a stone that a snake holds, calcine it seven times, soak and quench it seven times, and grind it with safflower to a fine powder. Add a small amount of musk and form pills the size of longan using white rice. Take one pill dissolved in mint tea once a day.</p>
<p>For heat and swelling under the neck, commonly known as frog plague, apply a poultice of five-leaf vine.</p>
<p>To treat canker sores: Take seven fresh eggplant stems weighing a certain amount and the same weight of fresh Fleeceflower root. Use one and a half pints of water to decoct and take. One dose will produce pus, and another will close the sore. If fresh ingredients are unavailable, dried ones may also be used, but they are less potent than fresh. This formula is a light remedy and should not be used for severe illnesses; those observing should not be misled.</p>
<p>For chronic ulcers that have persisted for years without healing, use soil from the walls of a thatched hut aged for a hundred years, ground to a powder, mixed with talcum powder, and applied as a poultice. It will heal by drying in half a month.</p>
<p>For scrofula (tuberculosis): Use two taels of lead, roast it in an iron vessel to produce black ash, mix with vinegar, and apply it. Cover with silk cloth and frequently change to remove harmful fluids. After half a month, it will not hurt or break, and will heal internally.</p>
<p>For phlegmatic swelling with heat and cold resembling scrofula: Grind lime to a powder, mix with ginkgo fruit flesh, and apply as a poultice, or mix with honey as an alternative.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a></p></div>

If activated, it causes throat pain and swelling of the jaw, making it difficult to look around; shoulder feels like being pulled, upper arm feels like being broken. This meridian governs diseases generated from fluids, leading to deafness, jaundice, cheek swelling, and pain in the neck, jaw, shoulder, upper arm, elbow, and outer back, influenced by excess or deficiency, heat or cold. </p>
<p>The foot Taiyang meridian of the bladder, if activated, causes throbbing headaches, perception of the eyes feeling displaced, stiff neck, back pain, a feeling of the waist being broken, inability to bend at the thigh, tightness in the knee, and a sensation akin to splitting in the ankle, leading to ankle cramps.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The view of excess and deficiency is determined by heat and cold. The muscle of the hand of the Yangming (Large Intestine) begins at the thumb&#39;s upper side, with its branches encircling the shoulder blade and close to the spine, while the direct part follows from the shoulder to the base of the neck. When illness affects the area it traverses, symptoms include pain and cramps, inability to raise the shoulder, and stiffness in the neck preventing lateral movement. Treatment involves burning needles and pricking; diagnosis is based on the numbers and pain points, and it is called &quot;Summer onset paralysis.&quot;</p>
<p>The muscle of the hand of the Taiyang (Small Intestine) originates from above the little finger and connects at the armpit; its branches extend to the back of the armpit, envelop around the shoulder blade, follow the neck, and exit in front of the foot of the Taiyang, connecting at the back of the ear&#39;s bony prominence. Symptoms include pain in the area behind the armpit, shoulder blade pain radiating to the neck, associated with ringing and pain in the ear, with prolonged closure of the eyes leading to recovery of vision. If the neck muscles are tense, it can lead to muscular atrophy and swelling in the neck due to heat or cold. Treatment involves burning needles and pricking; diagnosis is based on the numbers and pain points, and swelling requires additional sharp treatment.</p>
<p>The muscle of the hand of the Shaoyang (Triple Heater) starts at the tip of the little and next fingers and connects at the wrist, moving up the arm to the elbow, encircling the outer aspect of the arm, proceeding to the shoulder, and joining the hand of the Taiyang. Symptoms in the areas it traverses include cramping and rolled tongue. Treatment involves burning needles and pricking; diagnosis is based on the numbers and pain points, and it is called &quot;Late Summer paralysis.&quot;</p>

<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: How can we remove the poison of the cold and heat from the shrew&#39;s fistula? Qibo replied: The root of the shrew&#39;s fistula lies in the internal organs, while the ends surface between the neck and armpit, floating in the pulse without penetrating the muscles; when it manifests externally as pus or blood, it can be easily removed. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can it be removed? Qibo answered: We should address the root by pulling out the ends, causing the cold and heat to subside.

Measure beyond the four finger widths to the end, and compare it to where it bends and breaks near the tip of the spiral bone, relating to the tendons at the back of the foot; this is the mouse tail point. If you perform moxibustion on the left side, do so on the left side, and on the right side, do so on the right side; both should be treated at the same time, five treatments a year, and more moxibustion as the year progresses. It specifically treats all types of scrofula and requires abstention from sexual activity. The effectiveness is truly miraculous and can save lives. After moxibustion, if there are sores, crush plantain leaves and apply them. Be aware of any prohibitions for the person and choose auspicious days based on celestial healers.</p>
<p>Prohibitions after moxibustion: after performing moxibustion, avoid all fish, hot foods, raw wine, cold items, fresh meat, and excessive labor. </p>

<p>For treating scrofula, whether it has formed or not, whether it has burst or not, place your hand on the shoulder and raise it slightly so that the elbow bone tip appears; this indicates the site for moxibustion. If the left is affected, moxibustion should be done on the left elbow, if the right is affected then the right elbow should be treated; both elbows should be treated with three or four treatments. Additionally, take supplements; for those who have been treated for a year, moxibustion should be done once daily, and after three treatments, the sores will heal on their own.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a></p></div>

Rubbing should also be performed in a similar fashion; the technique is extremely effective. The practice starts at returning to the source, gradually leading to the affected area. Focus is placed on applying rotation, from small to large, penetrating and dispersing, dispersing and guiding, leading to the chest, circling several times, and then rotating back to the affected area. This method is practiced repeatedly, around several dozen times to disperse the lump. Deliver poison once daily, entering from the stomach and curving into the large intestine, then expelling through the food passage, removing the impure and retaining the pure. Caution is advised in maintaining the original yang, and one must avoid anger and irritability. The above method should be performed seven times in a day and night, and it will naturally dissipate without a trace.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A person suffering from pain in the neck and back, unable to move, found no relief from various wind medicines. I recalled a case in &quot;Thousand Gold Essence&quot; regarding kidney energy attacking the back, which was treated with a dose of Pepper and Deer Antler Powder, yielding some effect. It appears that the kidney energy, originating from the waist, travels up the spine to the Cao Xi point, and then enters the Mijing Palace. The Cao Xi point cannot be penetrated unless one is skilled in manipulation. Since it is stuck and cannot continue along this path, using pepper to guide it back into the channels will bring relief. The energy ascends and is countered by the downward action of the pepper, thus taking it results in healing.</p>
<p>In &quot;The Confucian Way of Serving Parents,&quot; it is recorded that a man named Dai was staying with the official in the West Hua area when suddenly a sore appeared on his neck, resembling a whitehead, with a swollen, hard red base. He initially disregarded it due to its small size. Unexpectedly, he encountered an old friend who invited him to drink sheep fat wine along with chicken, fish, salt, and garlic. Dai, unable to refuse due to their friendship and forgetting his dietary restrictions, found that night unbearable due to the pain from the sore, which swelled to his head, causing him to speak irrationally and see ghosts and spirits. The official, Xia, was extremely alarmed and wanted to report it to Dai&#39;s family. Dai laughed and said, “Please don’t worry; tomorrow it will be fine.” He then mixed wine with Tongjing Powder, taking six or seven qian, along with more than a hundred pills of boat and vehicle essence, and followed this with a hot flour soup. This triggered a strong reaction, both upward and downward, resulting in a large release, filling half a basin. By noon the next day, the swelling of the sore had subsided, and in one or two days, it completely healed. Xia was greatly astonished by this outcome.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

The healer said: &quot;This is caused by excessive fire; treat it with something cool and salty.&quot; He instructed her to take long salt to induce vomiting, and after one vomit, her sores began to form scabs.

<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Records&quot; notes: A scholar, Yang Zezhi, had a restless nature and a craving for lust, resulting in a testicular growth. This was due to liver fire and blood dryness causing muscle spasms. The treatment should nourish kidney water to generate liver blood. Disbelieving this, he took internal medicines to reduce fire and resolve phlegm, applying Nanshen and Shanglu externally, which caused it to swell as large as a bowl. I used remedies to tonify the middle and benefit Qi, along with Liuwei Dihuang, interspersed with Aloe pills, and after a year, his vital energy was restored and the swelling disappeared.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man who was naturally prone to anger had a slight swelling on his left neck, which gradually grew larger like a gourd. He experienced excessive thirst due to great heat, and his urine was frequently turbid. I judged this to be a deficiency of kidney water and prescribed Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang for recovery. There were also lumps in his chest and sides, as large as a measuring cup; some broke open like fungus or pomegranate, regardless of size, all were treated with the previous method.</p>
<p>A scholar named Jiang Jie had knots on his neck, arms, and ribs, and strictly took medicines to eliminate phlegm, reduce fire, and soften hardness, but to no avail. I said: This is a deficiency of liver and gallbladder blood, leading to dryness and heat. He persisted with the previous medicines, and by June of the following year, all knots had ruptured, with a pulse that was floating and large. I concluded that autumn&#39;s metal would become strong, while the liver&#39;s wood was being restrained, leading to no improvement. Eventually, this prediction came true.</p>
<p>The son of the old minister Yang Shizhai, aged seventeen, suffered from tuberculosis, experiencing fever and thirst, with red cheeks in the afternoon and a large, floating pulse at the left wrist. This indicated a deficiency of liver and kidney yin. I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang for more than twenty doses, adding Ren Shen and Huang Qi for over twenty more doses, but it just ruptured. However, the pus was clear and watery, with no muscle growth. Thus, I focused on Ren Shen, Huang Qi, Bai Zhu, and combined them with Shao Yao, Shu Di, Mai Dong, and Wu Wei, which made the pus thicker and facilitated muscle growth. I then prescribed another effective remedy, which cleared the tuberculosis poison and helped the sores to close.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a></p></div>

<p>A scholar named Zhang Ziling was prone to anger and had suffered from scrofula for a long time without improvement. His sores bled fresh blood, and the pulse at the left guan was strong but hard, suggesting that liver fire was causing erratic blood flow, indicating both qi and blood deficiency.

<p>Another individual developed a condition in front of and below the ear, which after recovery extended to the lateral neck and shoulder for three years, eventually spreading to the chest and armpits. Upon examination, his liver pulse was strong and rapid, and he was treated with Long Hui and San Jian pills. When he was about to recover, his liver pulse remained rapid. Four years later, he developed toxins in the lower abdomen and scrotum, which remained for over a year without improvement.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>One person, due to anger, developed a sore beneath the ear that extended to the axilla, with significant swelling and a malodorous wound that would not close. Treatment involved dispersing the swelling and promoting drainage, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another person, due to overexertion, experienced fatigue with fever; the pulse was large and forceful, but weak upon palpation. It was appropriate to use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. However, he did not believe it and rashly took purgative medicines, leading to continuous vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in death. Generally, this condition was inherently one of deficiency; if one does not discern between deficiency and excess and violates the regulations regarding diseases, it is rare not to suffer dire consequences. </p>
<p>Typically, treatment begins by regulating the menstrual cycle and relieving stagnation, and then using garlic moxibustion; many will resolve naturally. If not resolved, one should apply amber paste and, when there is pus, puncture it; otherwise, it may develop into another condition. If there are concomitant symptoms like phlegm or yin deficiency, one should only add agents for those symptoms and avoid interfering with other treatments. </p>
<p>If the qi and blood have already recovered but the mass has not dissipated, using dispersive agents may be appropriate, even if it takes over a month without improvement—the qi and blood will not feel weakened. Then, dispersing agents may be applied. Alternatively, if one encounters medicinal pills of unmatched potency, if their toxicity is profound, both medications should be stopped. Next, a few doses of the Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction can be used for adjustment. </p>
<p>If the wound does not heal, one may use fermented soybean cakes or amber paste. If there is a deficiency in both qi and blood, or if one carelessly eats or has emotional disturbances, no treatment should be administered. Nonetheless, in this condition, qi is paramount; with robust qi and blood, it is unnecessary to pursue corrosive agents, as they can self-decompose, but one should ensure the process facilitates closure. </p>
<p>If there is deficiency in qi and blood and one neglects to supplement first, while repeatedly using corrosive medicines, it is merely enough to invite failure. If there are chills and fever, and a red vein runs through the pupil of the eye, it should not be treated; if there is one vein, death occurs within a year; two veins indicate death within two years.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A person suffering from tuberculosis had excessive phlegm, a feeling of fullness and heaviness in the chest, and a tight pulse in the spleen and stomach. This indicates a deficiency in the spleen (earth) and an excess of liver (wood) overpowering it. The treatment should focus on strengthening the spleen and countering the liver. This patient prioritized treating phlegm first, taking bitter and cold phlegm-transforming medicines, which were ineffective, and then additionally taking Qi-breaking medicines, worsening the condition. Initially, they used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding several doses of Szechuan lovage; with reduced appetite and thoughts, they supplemented with a modified Middle-Strengthening and Qi-Benefiting Decoction by doubling the amount of white atractylodes, which improved their energy over a month. Later, they employed the Qi-Benefiting and Nourishing Decoction, leading to a reduction in swelling and a return of blood and energy after four months. </p>
<p>In this case, the tight pulse indicates an excess of wood, thus overpowering the spleen (earth) and acting as a harmful influence. Using bitter and cold medicines on a deficiency is a form of double deficiency. Moreover, phlegm can arise from various causes, necessitating different treatment methods. In general, when treating phlegm, excessive use of draining medicines can further weaken the spleen Qi, making phlegm easier to generate. If there is insufficient middle Qi, one must primarily use ginseng and atractylodes, supplemented by phlegm medicines.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A person suffered from a long-term illness with no signs of recovery; their mind was exhausted, and their pulse was weak. I wanted to administer the &quot;Tuo Li&quot; treatment, but they considered it impractical. Instead, they took a decoction for swelling and hard lumps. After more than half a month, they developed a fever, their appetite diminished, and they sought further treatment. I prescribed the &quot;Yiqi Yangrong&quot; decoction for three months. Because they diligently adhered to dietary restrictions, they were able to achieve results. Qi said: For tuberculous lymphadenopathy, if first detected, it should be treated internally. If it has persisted for a long time and the vital energy and blood are gradually declining, with cold muscles and chilled flesh, or with clear and thin pus, and toxic substances not expelled, with ulcer openings not closed, masses not red, and tubercles without pus, and the external symptoms unclear, &quot;Tuo Li&quot; treatment should be used. If pus has not formed, it should promote early pus formation. If pus has already discharged, it should encourage the rapid growth of new flesh. If blood and energy are deficient, &quot;Tuo Li&quot; should replenish them. If yin and yang are unbalanced, &quot;Tuo Li&quot; should adjust them. Generally, the method of &quot;Tuo Li&quot; ensures that ulcers do not exhibit signs of deterioration; this is why its use is advocated.</p>
<p>A woman had lymphadenopathy that extended to her chest and armpits, with pus and fluid oozing persistently. Over time, she experienced five heartburns, body aches, heaviness in her head and eyes, palpitations, flushed cheeks, a dry mouth and throat, feverish night sweats, decreased appetite, excessive sleeping, irregular menstrual periods, and abdominal pain. I diagnosed it as blood deficiency, not merely a result of the lymphadenopathy. After taking &quot;Xiaoyao San&quot; for a month, her condition improved slightly. She then took &quot;Bajian Tang&quot; with added peony root and Cyperus for over a month, and her menstruation normalized. After adding astragalus and white peony for two months, she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman had a lump that did not decay after it ruptured. With more than thirty doses of &quot;Yiqi Yangrong&quot; decoction, I also applied a powder to promote healing, followed by more than thirty additional doses of the original decoction, and then she healed.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman suffered from a long-standing fever and had a delayed menstrual period with scant flow. I prescribed Xiaoyao San along with Yiqi Yangrong Decoction. After more than two months, her energy and blood were restored, and her sores healed. However, she did not respond well to oral medications, so I applied a powdered herbal mixture to her acupuncture point and administered moxibustion to the Jianjing point until she recovered.</p>
<p>Another woman had lymphatic swellings but did not respond to blood-nourishing and qi-regulating medicines. After taking two doses of Shenxiao Gualou Powder, the condition improved immediately, and after six more doses, it completely resolved. After using drugs to relieve the obstruction, her energy and blood stabilized, and she recovered.</p>
<p>One woman had persistent lymphatic swellings and, due to a condition related to excessive wood energy, I attempted to reduce the swelling with a dispersing formula, which only worsened her condition. I believed that she had a deficiency in liver qi and blood, so I nourished the source of digestion with Liuwei Dihuang Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and by spring she was healed. If the condition was due to violent wind-fire in the liver with no loss of original qi, the previous decoction would be appropriate. If the wind-wood was excessive and caused her illness, then Xieqing Wan should be used, while the deficient should take Dihuang Wan. If water cannot nourish wood, this pill is also advised. If metal overcomes wood, one should tonify the spleen soil to generate water in the kidneys. In general, for diseases of wind and wood, strengthening the spleen soil will prevent wood from overcoming it. If we attempt to attack the liver, while bypassing the spleen and stomach, it results in wood overpowering earth.</p>
<p>A woman suffering from lymphatic swellings had poor sleep for over a year. The lesions burst and oozed pus. Her menstrual cycle was irregular, arriving either every fifty days or more than two months apart. She mistakenly took Tongjing Wan and was restless, unable to sleep.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man, due to extreme anger, developed swelling and pain under his jaw, leading to tuberculosis and feelings of oppression along with fever. He was treated with two doses of the Fang Mai Liu Qi formula, which relieved his chest congestion; then, he took two doses of Jing Fang Bai Du San, and the fever subsided. The liver pulse was still tight and slippery, so he received four doses of Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Chuanxiong, Angelica, and Peony, resulting in marked improvement in his pulse and symptoms. He took one dose of San Zhong Kui Jian Wan, and while most of the lumps subsided, one nodule remained. He then took two taels of Yu Xian Wu Bi Wan and was cured.</p>
<p>A woman who had long suffered from depression experienced a wound that would not heal, accompanied by fever and dry mouth, scant menstrual flow, lack of appetite, and significant fatigue in the afternoon. After taking over twenty doses of Yi Qi Yang Rong Tang, her condition improved slightly. I suggested she need one hundred doses to ensure safety. However, she sought quick results and instead took pills containing cantharides and repeatedly used aggressive toxins, which led to recurring nodules, resulting in continuous discharge and ultimately, no salvation. This condition was due to deficiency and stagnation of Qi, thus a restoration of physical strength, Qi, and regulation of menstrual pulses was needed. If a violent remedy were used, it would further deplete Qi and blood, increasingly manifesting as tuberculosis. The lumps remained unbroken; even if they ruptured, they would not heal, indicating insufficient Qi and blood. Moreover, the blood of the two channels was originally inadequate and should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>Another man had a long-standing condition that did not heal; pus was more clear, and he appeared yellow and emaciated. Every morning, he experienced diarrhea. After several doses of Er Shen Wan, his diarrhea stopped. He then took Liu Jun Zi Tang with added Chuanxiong and Angelica, and after a month, his body gradually recovered. He was treated with Mung Bean Cakes for moxibustion and used restorative measures to make a plaster, and after over three months, he was healed.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man suffered from this condition, which had not yet ulcerated, feeling fatigued and experiencing fever. He was treated with the Bu Zhong Yi Qi decoction and showed slight improvement; however, after taking the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction for a month, it ulcerated and healed after another month.</p>
<p>A woman had accumulated heat in the liver meridian, causing pain and a rapid, deep pulse. After taking four doses of the She Xiang Lian Qiao decoction, she experienced slight improvement. She then took San Chong Gui Jian Wan for over a month and saw it diminish. Dan Xi noted that scrofula must arise from the foot Shao Yang meridian. If one does not follow restrictions, it may extend to the foot Yang Ming meridian. Rich food and prolonged stagnation of Qi can invoke poison, wind, and heat; these factors trigger transformations. One must differentiate between excess and deficiency; the excess is easier to treat, while the deficient requires caution. This meridian governs decisive actions, possesses fiery energy, and often presents with abundant Qi but scant blood. If a woman experiences this, particularly if her menstrual flow is irregular, it can lead to fluctuations of cold and heat, possibly developing into tidal fever. Unless there is a desire to eat bland foods, it is beyond the skill of a master physician to heal.</p>
<p>Another man had swelling and hardness that did not resolve for a long time and did not produce pus. He took a formula to dispel toxins and solid accumulations without effect; he was then instructed to moxa the tips of the elbow and shoulder; after continuing with the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction, the swelling dissipated after more than a month.</p>
<p>A man with a similar condition also received moxibustion at the front points and drank the same decoction; pus formed, and he was treated with acupuncture, which caused it to close.</p>
<p>A woman, provoked by anger, developed painful tubercles. Upon examination, her Qi and blood were both in excess. She first took a highly effective purging formula and then over thirty doses of the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction, after which the tubercles subsided. In treating this condition, if there is deficiency, one should first use the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction to replenish Qi and blood slightly before applying the purging formula to eliminate the toxins, then continue with the previous medication; success is guaranteed with this method.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young woman, aged seventeen, experienced occasional pain under her jaw, with symptoms fluctuating between cold and hot, resembling malaria. Her liver pulse was strong and long, indicating an abundance of blood. I first administered two doses of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, which provided slight relief; then, I treated her with Sheng Di Huang Pill, resulting in recovery. </p>
<p>The &quot;Good Prescriptions for Women&quot; states that there has been no mention of the ailments of widows in the past. Only the writings of Cang Gong and discussions with Zhu Cheng touch upon how a widow, being solely yin without yang, desires a man but cannot obtain one, leading to depression and resulting in illness. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: &quot;As heaven and earth intertwine, all things transform; when male and female unite, all things are born.&quot; Can there be a solitary yang without yin? When one is confined within the boudoir, unfulfilled desires lead to a struggle between yin and yang, with symptoms alternating between cold and hot, resembling malaria, which can eventually lead to tuberculosis. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are symptoms such as amenorrhea, white discharge, phlegm reversal, headache, pleurisy, chest tightness, facial discoloration, and emaciation— all of which are ailments of widows. Upon examining her pulse, only the liver pulse was strong at the wrist above the fat pad. Delving into her pulse and understanding her illness revealed it was all due to an abundance of blood. The classics say: &quot;When a man&#39;s essence is vigorous, he thinks of a household, but when a woman&#39;s blood is abundant, she conceives.&quot; Observing this essence and blood indicates the matter is more than halfway understood.</p>
<p>One woman suffering for a long time without producing pus had a floating and slippery pulse. I aimed to replenish both qi and blood, but it began to spontaneously resolve. She desired internal consumption, strictly taking pills made from centipedes and medicines for dispersing hard masses; her qi and blood became even more deficient and she died.</p>
<p>A certain weak man, after an abscess, had a mass that did not decompose. Both his qi and blood were deficient. I used Tuo Li Yang Rong Decoction, which began to restore his qi and blood; the mass remained, so I used a hairpin to remove it. After taking decoctions for over a month, he recovered.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a></p></div>

<p>A woman became swollen in the neck due to anger, followed by irregular menstruation, swelling in her limbs, and painful urination. This was a blood condition. First, she took medicinal pills made from pepper seeds; her swelling subsided with her menstrual cycle. Then, she took the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added Chai Hu and Zhi Ke, and after several days, her neck swelling also disappeared. There were also cases where difficulty in urination led to body swelling, causing menstrual blockage, known as a water condition, which should be treated with the Ting Li Pill. According to &quot;Good Remedies for Women,&quot; if a woman’s swelling began with menstrual cessation and later involved limb swelling and difficulty in urinating, it is known as a blood condition. Water transforms into blood, and if the blood is obstructed, it may revert to water. She should take the pepper seed pills. If the situation began with difficulty in urination, leading to body swelling and resulting in menstrual blockage, it is classified as a water condition, requiring the Ting Li pills.</p>
<p>There was a maiden, nineteen years old, who had neck swelling with unchanged complexion, her muscles gradually diminishing, and experiencing painful muscle spasms. This was due to emotional distress harming her, resulting in diminished blood and energy. She should first nourish her blood and energy. However, she did not believe it and took herbal medicine for wind, and consequently, her condition worsened. Lu Di Jing stated: &quot;The classics say: When the spirit suffers from overthinking, the flesh wastes away; when the mind suffers from worry, the limbs become incapacitated; when the soul suffers from sorrow, the muscles spasm; when the ethereal spirit suffers from excess joy, the skin becomes withered; when determination suffers from intense anger, the back can hardly bend or straighten.&quot; </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman in a room is often anxious and angry, experiencing swelling and pain under her ears, with chills and fevers. Her liver pulse is tense and rapid. I administered Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding Qing Pi, Niu Bang Zi, Jing Jie, and Fang Feng, which alleviated the chills and fevers. Additionally, I used Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with several doses of Si Wu Decoction to reduce the swelling. Her father wished to eliminate the root cause of the illness so that it would not recur. I explained that the liver is responsible for storing blood and nourishing the tendons. If anger disrupts the liver qi, it can injure the liver, leading to stagnation and swelling. The patient must learn to regulate herself to avoid further issues. Otherwise, with repeated liver injuries, blood storage is compromised; blood deficiency results in difficult symptoms. Later, without precaution, she developed three lumps and repeatedly used destructive medicines, which did not subside, and she ultimately died.</p>
<p>A young woman suffered swelling under her ears, had a hardworking nature, and experienced fevers and dry mouth. Her menstrual flow was always late and sparse. An old woman believed it was due to menstrual blockage and used leeches to treat it, which only led to further deficiency and death. The menstrual flow is governed by the Hand Taiyang and Hand Taiyin meridians. These two connections regulate one another, with the upper governing breast milk and the lower governing menstrual flow, representing the residual energy of the meridians. If there are no external invasions from the six excesses and no internal injuries from the seven emotions, and if the spleen and stomach are strong, then the qi of the Chong and Ren meridians is robust, making the menstrual flow arrive punctually. However, with a sallow complexion, thin limbs, fevers, dry mouth, and delayed and scant menstrual flow, it indicates a deficiency of yin blood, not an excess or blockage. It is advisable to gradually nourish the blood and qi with suitable remedies, allowing the menstrual energy to flourish and the flow to resume its normal timing.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Upon releasing a palace maid, aged over thirty, she experiences pain in her hips, without swelling or discoloration. She feels sharp pain during urination and defecation, and the pain intensifies when using the toilet. This condition is due to stagnant blood infiltrating the channels, indicating a disconnection between the sexes, which is difficult to treat. Subsequently, she developed abscesses and ultimately passed away. This woman was a concubine of the Tang family in our village; Tang was a merchant and often away, indicating that this woman, left alone for a long time, harbored repressed feelings and was unable to fulfill her desires, leading to her illness. The worsening condition with abscesses suggests that both emotional state and bodily fluids have been compromised, making aggressive treatments inappropriate. Thus, the &quot;Essence and Blood&quot; chapter states: if one engages with a woman without having fully circulated the essence, there will be unmet places in the body, leading to future ailments. If the yin is diminished but one still longs for sexual interaction to release the essence, the essence fails to exit and the body deteriorates. The urinary channel becomes obstructed, causing painful urination. As the essence is consumed and exhausted, the pathways for urination and defecation become more painful, leading to an increased urge, which in turn heightens the pain. If a woman, upon reaching her menstrual prime, does not have a male partner for over ten years, her condition will be unbalanced; if it has been less than ten years and she desires a partner, it will also cause imbalance. When imbalances occur, old blood will not flow out and new blood will stagnate, possibly seeping into the bones, causing swelling, or even making conception difficult despite coupling. Frequent male interactions may lead to an exhaustion of essence, and excessive lactation can deplete blood, threatening life. Observing her essence and blood, we can see that the situation is already quite severe.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young woman, seventeen years old, suffers from lumps for a long time, with her monthly cycle yet to commence. She experiences fever and cough, lacking appetite. An elderly woman wishes to use medicinal herbs like croton and cinnamon to open her channels first. I said that this condition of tidal fever and irregular menstruation should not be treated in such a manner; however, if the pulse is not weak and does not show signs of tidal fever, there is still hope for treatment. One must nourish the vital energy and blood, and replenish the bodily fluids, allowing the channels to naturally open. They insist on quick-acting remedies regardless. I said: “This is not the correct treatment.” Such methods are harsh remedies that greatly enhance yang fire; if the yin blood enters this state, it leads to chaotic movement, and if the spleen and stomach endure it, they become more deficient. The channels may open but will not stop, leading to decreased appetite, increased tidal fever, and ultimately resulting in irretrievable decline. The text states: &quot;At seven years of age, a girl’s kidney energy is strong, and her teeth and hair grow long; by fourteen, the heavenly tide arrives, the ren channel opens, the tai chong pulse is vigorous, and the monthly cycle occurs regularly.&quot; However, when the time has passed without occurrence, it becomes abnormal and must have a cause. A woman’s life is based on vital energy and blood; when one becomes ill, it is invariably preceded by damage to these. Women often suffer from emotional strain. In the world, there are young women and men who harbor pent-up thoughts, excessive worry leading to strain, resulting in issues; men may display a drained look, while women may find their monthly cycles cease.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>How can this be explained? It is because worry and contemplation harm the heart; when the heart is harmed, blood flows backwards and diminishes. When the blood flows backwards and diminishes, the spirit disperses, leading to the closing of the monthly flow. When fire is sick, it cannot nourish its offspring, thus losing its appetite. When the spleen is deficient, the metal energy is insufficient, leading to cough. When the water energy is exhausted, the limbs become dry. When the fundamental energy is not replenished, one becomes easily angered, the hair turns gray, and the muscles and bones weaken. One waits for the five organs to spread their conditions, and then one dies. This is a form of ailment within labor that is most difficult to treat, as the illness arises from within the five organs, with no clear end. The power of medicine cannot reach it. However, if one can adjust their mind and spirit and use medicine to support the recovery, then it is possible to achieve a narrow escape from death. This serves as an example. For the treatment of other ailments, one can diagnose based on pulse and symptoms. Zhang states: If a young woman’s monthly flow has not occurred for a long time, she must not use cooling agents like Artemisia. Many physicians believe that the blood of a young woman is hot and hence treat it with cooling medicines. What they do not understand is that blood flows when it is heated and coagulates when it is cold. &quot;The Essential Formulas for Health Preservation&quot; mentions this in great detail; this principle is very valid and should not be overlooked. If the cycle becomes slightly irregular and gradually becomes obstructed, with the bones and flesh of the hands and feet becoming painful and emaciated, and gradually producing tidal fever, and the pulse becomes thin and rapid, this is due to deficiency of yin and weakness of blood, with yang overpowering it. The small water cannot extinguish the strong fire, the fire pushes the water dry, and the essence is lost. It is necessary to nourish the water and increase yin; one must be cautious and not use toxic medicines to clear it, rather, one should consider Bai Zi Ren Wan and Ze Lan Wan.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a></p></div>

They then used moxibustion with a fermented bean cake and continued with the previous medication, adding costus root and cyperus, and it took two months to heal. Generally, if a wound is hard and does not rupture, or if it ruptures and does not heal, it is due to insufficient qi.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman, due to anger, developed swelling under her ears, a headache, and alternating chills and fevers. She was treated with Jingfang Baidu San, adding Huangqin, which addressed the surface symptoms; however, she had little appetite and experienced evening fevers. Dongyuan remarked: although there is false heat, it should not be attacked heavily; if the heat is removed, cold will arise. Thus, she was treated with Xiao Chai Hu Tang, adding Digupi, Chuanxiong, Danggui, Fuling, Bai Zhu, and Chenpi. After ten or more doses, she recovered.</p>
<p>The next spring, her condition hardened without breaking, and she sought the formula again. It was prescribed as Ba Zhen Tang with Xiangfu, Chai Hu, Digupi, and Jiegeng, which she made herself. After six or seven doses, her condition improved, yet she continued taking Ren Shen Baidu San, which worsened her state. She also took Liuqi Yin, resulting in night sweats, fever, a dry mouth, and loss of appetite. By autumn, she sought treatment again. Upon diagnosis, her qi and blood were critically deficient. I advised against treatment, and she consequently passed away.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when people have sores and ulcers, they do not examine the fundamental deficiency or excess of qi, nor the surface or internal condition; they simply take Baidu or Liuqi medicine, not realizing that Baidu San is for treating surface symptoms. If there are surface symptoms, only one or two doses should be taken; more can harm the original qi and worsen the toxicity. Though there is Ren Shen, it cannot replenish what is lost. Liuqi Yin is a depleting medicine; if the qi is bound and the chest feels full, only two or three doses are advisable; more can harm the blood and qi, resulting in a worsening condition, and although there is Xiong and Gui, they are not reliable. Danxi noted: this is not a transformation of rich foods or damp toxins, but is caused by deficiency and qi stagnation.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman suffered from a persistent abscess that would not heal, with clear pus not drying up. I treated her with Ba Zhen Tang, and she improved slightly; however, she suddenly experienced pain in her shoulders and back, making it impossible for her to turn her head. This was caused by stagnation in the bladder meridian, and should be treated with Fang Feng Tong Qi Tang. The bladder meridian begins at the inner canthus of the eye, crosses the forehead to the crown, descends near the ears, and then continues to the back of the head, passing down the neck to the shoulders, and extends down to the lower back. When the meridian&#39;s energy is disturbed, it results in back pain and a stiff neck, which clearly indicates a bladder meridian issue. </p>
<p>She insisted that the abscess was related to the gallbladder meridian and that its path affects the sides of the neck; this implies that there is fire disturbance in the meridian. She then took herbal medicine to clear the liver and reduce fire, which caused her to lose her appetite and experience severe pain. She requested that I examine her pulse again, and I found her stomach energy had become weaker. I first prescribed Si Jun Zi Tang combined with Chen Pi, Chao Shao Yao, Ban Xia, Qiang Huo, and Man Jing Zi in four doses, which helped her eat and relieved her pain.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The woman of the Tian family, over thirty years of age, suffered from scrofula, which had ulcerated and failed to heal. She received Ba Zhen Decoction with additional Chai Hu, Di Gu Pi, Xia Ku Cao, Xiang Fu, and Bei Mu—over fifty doses—resulting in gradual improvement of her physical condition. Further, she was given Bi Xiao San in two doses, which allowed the ulcer to close, but her vitality and blood remained unbalanced. After taking an additional thirty doses of the previous medicine, her condition stabilized. Later, Tian Sheng relied on this formula indiscriminately to treat others, not differentiating between those who were weak or strong, completely unaware that the ingredients included certain toxic substances, which though effective in treating scrofula, could deplete vital energy if used excessively. If a patient had excess vitality and blood, it would be appropriate to first use this to purge, and then follow up with tonics for recovery. However, if the patient was weak and purgative medicine was applied, or if corrosive medicine was used, while the stagnant flesh might be removed, the ulcer would not close properly, leading to difficulties in treatment.</p>
<p>In Guangdong, Chen Fangbo&#39;s son, after a long and exhausting journey, developed a fever with a weak, large pulse and swelling beneath the ear, indicative of strain damage. Administering a restorative formula known as Zhong Yi Qi Tang naturally helped reduce the fever and swelling. If one were to focus excessively on detoxification, it could lead to further weakness. Despite this warning, the patient took fire-reducing medicine and Bi Xiao San, ultimately leading to vomiting, diarrhea, and death by starvation. Strain and exhaustion diminish vitality; as vitality declines, fire surges. The surging fire harms the spleen&#39;s function, resulting in weariness and fever, a sign of injured vital energy. Danxi stated: one should restore vitality and balance the meridians; only then would the sores heal on their own. Sweating or purging should not be done. If one blindly applies purgatives without discerning the unique pulse conditions and meridian pathologies, danger is rarely avoided.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a></p></div>

<p>A woman aged twenty had a lump below her ear that corresponded with her menstrual cycle, experiencing headaches in the afternoon after her period started.

Dongyuan noted that symptoms of fever accompanied by heat, persistent thirst, agitation, and warm skin, together with a strong, weak pulse or symptoms like eye pain and dry nose, are not indicative of Bai Hu Tang syndrome, but rather blood deficiency causing agitation, to be principally addressed with Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang. Furthermore, for cases of internal heat with inability to eat, accompanied by spontaneous sweating and shortness of breath, one should use cooling remedies to drain heat and tonify qi. If there is an ability to eat despite heat, with dry mouth and tongue, along with constipation, one should employ harsh cooling remedies to counteract heat and replenish fluids.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Essentials of Surgery&quot; states: A man suffered from a neck abscess for over ten days. Observing the severity of the wound, the roots extended towards both ears and the area was swollen, red, and hot, with a floating and rapid pulse. Initially, two doses of Huang Lian Xiao Du San were administered to reduce the seriousness, stabilizing the roots slightly. Later, several doses of Tuo Li Xiao Du San were given, yet it unexpectedly became necrotic. Upon examining the pulse, it was weak and floating. Inquiring about the patient revealed he was over fifty, had long struggled with fertility issues, had a concubine at home, and was burdened by excessive worry and overexertion, which harmed his vital energy. The size of the abscess was significant, merely able to erupt but unable to develop into pus. Therefore, a dose of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang was prescribed, adding Jie Geng and Bai Zhi, with double portions of Ren Shen and Bai Zhu, each three qian. Externally, the mulberry wood moxibustion method was used, applied twice daily; also, Zi Xia Ointment was applied for several days. The patient’s head and face were swollen, both eyes nearly shut; his condition became alarming. Eventually, the wound eroded and began to produce pus, yielding several liters over the course of half a month.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a></p></div>

The sore was located more on the right side and should not be taken lightly; moxibustion was necessary. After applying moxa with garlic for fifteen applications, pain was felt, and treatment ceased. Later, the patient considered it a minor issue and neglected internal medicine. Four days later, the sore reappeared, accompanied by swelling in the neck, rigidity, and deep purple pain, along with constipation. The pulse was firm and strong. I prescribed an internal formula of疏黄连汤 with two qian of Yuanming powder to relieve the constipation, followed by two doses of消毒救苦汤.

The color was hard and purple, the root and base dispersed and flat, and her six pulses were large and forceful.

There are several reasons: first, the initial signs showed swollen flesh but no sore; second, the root and base were flat and dispersed, indicating a deficiency of true Qi unable to contain the toxic energy; third, a dry mouth and troubled heart indicated internal fire; fourth, a purple and dark appearance suggested stagnant blood and toxic accumulation with no tendency to ulcerate; fifth, the large pulse indicated that the toxic sore was flourishing, with the vital energy being overcome, leading to the eventual softening and sinking of the sore, followed by internal invasion of toxic heat leading to death.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man had a sore on his neck for five or six days, and went to see it without taking much thought; his head turned yellow, and the root spread wide. I said, &quot;This must be treated urgently.&quot; He left, displeased with my words. He then sought a doctor from the neighborhood, who declared it a minor ailment, which pleased him. After using the medicine for another five days, the sore had hardened, its root expanded, and the poison had spread to his shoulders, flowing down to his neck, causing swelling in his chest and breasts, along with nausea, vomiting, chills, fever, and a lack of appetite. The condition of the sore appeared truly fearsome, and he began to believe my earlier words, again seeking my treatment. The appearance of the sore was dreadful; it was beyond the reach of medicinal power. </p>
<p>I first used a scallion and mugwort decoction to wash away the old medicine, then boiled some medicine and performed cupping at two places to draw out the stagnant blood. I followed this by inserting a silver needle at an angle into the root of the sore to penetrate the affected areas, placing toad venom into the openings. After that, I detoxified and promoted pus generation, finally covering the area with a healing ointment and applying a magical plaster from the True Monarch. Gradually, the condition improved, and the poison retreated back to the original area at the back of the neck. </p>
<p>In addition, he took internal medicine to lower fire and transform phlegm for three to four days. Once the major issues subsided and the internal pus was cleared, he switched to taking a herbal tonic to strengthen his body. For all hard nodules that would not dissolve, treat them; for those that were rotten but not painful, remove them; for new growths that were slow to heal, nurture them. By managing his condition in this manner for nearly three months, he finally achieved a complete recovery. This serves as a caution that the patients&#39; reluctance to admit illness and seek medical help can lead them close to death.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a></p></div>

Appreciative of her slender form, despite the condition progressing and potentially leading to corrosion, it was worth noting beforehand. </p>
<p>First, I applied garlic moxibustion, followed by placing toad venom cake around the edges to draw out toxins and scatter them, in order to keep the roots intact. Internally, I prescribed a detoxifying formula to take several times, but the sore remained hard and painful, and I indicated it would take until a certain day to improve. Moreover, since the sore had not begun to break down, examining her pulse revealed it was thin and rapid without strength, indicating internal weakness and an inability to resolve the toxins into pus, with pain being the priority; thus, how could it be expected to improve?</p>
<p>Next, I switched to a formula to benefit qi and nourish the essence, adding schisandra and angelica, and after three doses, the swelling gradually began to rise.

I said: &quot;In three more days, after noon, the pain may stop.&quot; When the time arrived, the necrotic tissue had fallen off by half. Near noon, I used a dose of frankincense to quell the pain, and in the afternoon, the pain suddenly receded, allowing for a peaceful sleep. The patient&#39;s family was overjoyed. I said: &quot;Not so; it is merely that the medication has been applied appropriately at the right time. Though my prediction extends to half a month, it applies at this moment. Trust in it, and you will not go astray.&quot; In the coming days, the necrosis will be fully resolved, the flesh will revert to normal, and the mouth will be restored. The family made notes with black string to track the days and found that there was neither excess nor deficiency.

Her family was fearful, as she was overweight, and this location was not typical for such a sore. I examined her high forehead and lively presence; though the sore was troubling, it could be tolerated. She wanted to treat it from the inside, but I advised her against medication, suggesting instead the use of acupuncture. She agreed. I used a fine needle to penetrate six or seven points deep into the sore, stopping at the soft tissue to release the stagnant blood. I then inserted a piece of toad venom into the hole and instructed her to take toad venom pills, leading to a great sweat and resolution. The next day, a little pus began to emerge from the sore, gradually decreasing. Concerned that internal toxins might still be present, I prescribed a few medications to detoxify and clear heat. Within ten days, she was well. Generally, when one seeks to dissipate a sore, one must first eliminate the root cause, then release the toxic energy, allowing the toxin to weaken, avoiding any internal aggression.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

After nearly half a month, the base of the abscess grew larger, with the wound only oozing bloody fluid, foul and filthy, surrounded by purple-black skin, soft and sunken without pus. His face was pale, his nose nostrils flared, hands were cold, and his breathing was rapid. Upon examining his pulse, it was loose and big without a root; this was a sign of internal failure, so there was no need for treatment. It would be chaotic to use medicine in this case. He then called in another physician to treat him, who also inquired and found no issues. The patient resented me for not treating him and, whenever he encountered friends or family, he forced himself to hold on, sternly insisting he would not accept death. I said: &quot;If your heart is unwilling, you will not die yet. In five more days, you will surely die.&quot; As it turned out, he did.

However, the swelling at the nape of his neck remained hard and painful, indicating an accumulation of poison likely to turn into pus. He continued with Huoxiang Zhengqi San, adding Chuanxiong, Danggui, and Zaozi for several doses, and once the pus was ripe, it was drained, leading to a quick reduction in the swelling and pain.

<p>A woman had been a widow for six years with a young child and had developed a hardened emotional state due to worry over the past six months. Additionally, she faced menstrual irregularities, alternating chills and fever, and significant weight loss, with a taut and rapid pulse. This condition was due to the exhaustion of her qi and blood, and the reckless movement of liver fire. The principle is to replenish what has been lost; one should not use harmful medications that further deplete. Initially, she took Xiaoyao San with added Xiangfu, Danshen, and Fritillaria to harmonize her blood and relieve liver qi stagnation. After that, she used Yiqi Yungong Tang for over a month, gradually restoring her qi and blood, which helped regulate her menstrual cycle and revive her vitality. Externally, fire needles were used to puncture the hardened area, inserting yellow medicinal threads several times until the holes widened. Then, Bingzi San was applied over the area and sealed. By the thirteenth day, the hardened mass fell off. She applied Hongyu ointment to promote healing and contraction, while internally switching to Ren Shen Yang Rong Tang with Xiangfu and Mu Xiang for over thirty doses, which restored her health. The woman was careful in her daily routines, avoided emotional disturbances, and maintained a restrictive diet, which allowed her to recover; otherwise, it would have been impossible.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

Additionally, she suffered from interruptions in her menstrual flow, alternating between cold and heat like intermittent fever, along with a cough and rapid pulse, though her cheeks were not flushed. This signified the onset of a deficiency of yin with excessive fire, leading to a consumptive condition that could not be cured by medication. Observing her physical appearance, she showed no signs of decay. I said, to treat this illness, one must first address her heart; there is still hope for recovery. The father then asked, &quot;What medicine can treat the heart?&quot; I replied, &quot;It is not a matter of medicine.&quot; The Book of Changes states: &quot;Heaven and earth are in a state of diffusion, and all things transform into purity; the union of male and female essence leads to the generation of all things.&quot; This is the way of creation and nurturing between heaven, earth, and humanity. This illness arises solely from a lack of yang energy in the face of excessive yin, resulting in stagnation and inhibition, described as an illness contrary to natural principles.

He should first nourish his qi and blood, and once the foundation is strengthened, then treat the sores. He took over ten doses of herbs to nourish and strengthen the spleen, but saw no effect. Thinking it would take time, he became misled by an alchemist and took medicine on his own, including drugs from the centipede, ba, and musk, which caused him to have continuous diarrhea for ten or more times.

The wiry nature indicated errant liver fire, and the rapidity showed excessive spleen heat. Initially, she was given a Regulating Liver Decoction with Gardenia to calm the liver wood, and after five doses, her pulse began to normalize. Then, she took several doses of a Decoction to Clear the Liver and Relieve Depression to disperse the stagnation. Next, she used a Nourishing Qi and Blood Decoction to regulate her qi and blood, occasionally taking a decoction to disperse swelling and soften the hard nodules, while applying amber ointment externally. After a hundred days of this regimen, her vital energy was restored, and the hardness had largely dissipated, leaving only a small nodule. Thinking she was cured, she stopped taking medication. However, a year later, her husband faced a losing gamble, leading to sudden anxiety and fear, causing a recurrence of the swelling. Her pulse became wiry, thin, and rapid, indicating a depletion of yin blood, with yang fire surging, and her previous symptoms reappeared.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, there are also issues with the chest and diaphragm, food and drink lack flavor, the urine is excessive and early, and the appearance is haggard and unrefined. This is due to the spirit being hurt by overthinking, leading to loss of flesh; the mind being distressed by sorrow, leading to paralysis of the limbs; the soul being wounded by sadness, leading to muscle cramps; the corporeal spirit being harmed by excessive joy, leading to skin deterioration; and the will being injured by violent anger, leading to inability to move the spine. All these are symptoms of internal damage from the seven emotions. </p>
<p>The treatment should nourish the qi and blood, harmonize the spleen and stomach, strengthen the kidneys, and clear the heart, relieving depression and stagnation to ensure safety. However, they are unwilling to believe and still wish to take the previous medicines to reduce swelling and resolve hardness, and they want to moxibust the swollen area to achieve internal resolution. I said: This is not like before; now I dare not treat it. Please have the visiting physician create the previous medicine, also moxibust the affected area, and moxibust the elbow tip. This is truly a matter of addressing a deficiency with further deficiency and dealing with an excess with further excess.</p>
<p>In the end, it resulted in increased fever, spontaneous sweating, coughing, a stiff neck, limbs unable to retract, no pus from the moxibustion wounds, blood and water not stopping, and swelling becoming more intense; this indicates damage to the organs and cannot last long. Moreover, a month later there were reports of breathlessness, hoarseness, and the expulsion of phlegm and blood, leading to death.

Generally, this meridian is characterized by an abundance of qi and a deficiency of blood, arising from shock, worry, and contemplation.

Initially, it emerges like a bean and gradually grows to resemble a plum pit, sometimes appearing as one, or three to five nodules. When pressed, they move slightly and cause mild pain; there is no fever, only a slight maturation in the afternoon or nighttime dryness in the mouth, diminished appetite, and fatigue in the limbs. They remain firm and do not rupture; when they do rupture, they do not heal, all due to insufficient qi and blood, often transforming into phthisis. Patients may feel redness and swelling that can appear above or below, to the left or right, often in clusters of three to five, rupturing and releasing pus and blood, leading to the formation of scrofula. Singular lumps are termed tubercles; those that tend to connect are referred to as scrofula. However, this condition is not caused by rich foods but rather by a combination of deficiency and stagnant qi. Therefore, it requires treatment with tonics to nourish qi and blood, allowing the sores to resolve naturally. Using harsh or drastic medicines will damage the blood and qi further and hinder recovery. If not treated promptly, it could lead to fatality. Madao Chuang (Horse-Cutter Ulcer) is also governed by the Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian, which, like the Sanjiao Meridian, is characterized by an abundance of qi and a deficiency of blood. This may appear in front of or behind the ear, beneath the ear extending to the jaw, or in the chest and sides, or along the flanks, persisting firm without breaking.

The answer: This is called \"Zhu Abscess.\" Initially, it does not swell much, but there is persistent pain and itching, and clear fluid comes out irregularly. Gradually it grows larger, resembling the spots on a tortoise shell; it is also known as \"Transforming Bone Ulcer.\" One should urgently take \"Eight Formation Powder,\" \"Life-Saving Elixir,\" and \"Vitality Drink\" with added Platycodon and Bupleurum. If it becomes ulcerated past the appropriate time and exposes bone over time, it is a serious sign. This condition often arises in people with accumulated depression, and it is most common in those with seven evils present; those who have broken prohibitions will not recover. **Surgical Authenticity** [Ming Dynasty, Chen Shigong] **On Brain Abscess** Brain abscesses are commonly referred to as \"Dui Kou.\" However, their manifestations differ, having two sources. If acquired from a combination of dampness and heat, through external invasion, it is lighter; if arising from internal organ stagnation that manifests externally, it is more severe. Why is this? The illness of dampness and heat arises from the climate, where cold and heat are not balanced, seasonal temperature changes are irregular, and yin and yang are out of harmony. Those with a weak constitution are easily invaded. Although the area behind the neck belongs to the Governor Vessel, it also governs the pathway of solar cold and water; all invasions cause qi and blood to stagnate, and stagnation leads to swelling. This is the case when acquired externally. When the illness first arises, there is pain at the onset, often appearing at critical points, with rapid heat and pain in the first few days, sometimes accompanied by chills and fever. The mouth feels dry yet is not parched, the color is red with active roots, the ulcer raises gradually in severity, the shape is not diffuse or large, the pain comes and goes, and it is prone to pus and corruption. The ability to taste food remains, and there are no significant changes in appetite or activity. Although the external symptoms may seem fearsome, if there are no signs of the seven evils, this belongs to yang conditions, and since it arises from external sources, it often can resolve without treatment."},{"anchor":"trans-48p","marker":"48p","type":"translation","text":"All the internal organs that accumulate and become heavy have five sources: First, the heart governs blood, so when the heart is disturbed, it leads to restlessness and excessive heat, causing swelling as it interacts with cold water in the neck. Second, the liver regulates the tendons, and when anger injures the liver, it affects the blood vessels, resulting in a lack of nourishment for the tendons, which can lead to swelling. If the problem is not resolved, the skin may show a dark purple color, and it may feel hard and swollen. If it ruptures, blood and foul water may flow without pain or pus, indicating liver qi injury. Third, the spleen governs the muscles, so worries harm the spleen. As spleen qi declines or if rich foods affect the stomach, this can result in stagnation in the middle jiao, preventing qi from circulating and leading to swelling, where the outer skin may appear rotten but the inside remains hard and unruptured, accompanied by dry mouth and tongue, inability to eat, and foul discharge. These signs indicate spleen qi injury."},{"anchor":"trans-49p","marker":"49p","type":"translation","text":"The lungs govern the skin and hair, thus melancholy harms the lungs. When the lungs are injured, the pores close, the channels become obstructed, and the qi cannot flow smoothly. Stagnation throughout the meridians leads to swelling, with ulcers often appearing flat and depressed, having a pale and unremarkable color. The skin may become rotten and greasy like spilled soup, breathing becomes coarse and short, the face appears dull and the nose congested, leading to excessive phlegm and persistent coughing. These symptoms all indicate injury to lung qi. The kidneys govern the bones and marrow, thus excessive desires harm the kidneys. When the kidneys are injured, the true yin energy becomes depleted. Once the true yin fails, the fire of true yang arises on its own, which can fluctuate up and down, in motion or stillness, causing distress to the internal organs, consuming the body fluids, altering appearance and voice. The ulcers have a purple-black coloration, with a rapid and irregular pulse, restlessness and dry mouth, leading to thirst with drinking. These symptoms all indicate injury to kidney qi. In treating these conditions, one must first distinguish between deficiency and excess internally, and between yin and yang externally. One must align with seasonal changes, observing the pathology. If a sore has not yet formed after seven days, the channels should be opened to induce sweating. If seven days have passed and the condition has established itself, treatment must include both supplementation and drainage.

Internally, I prescribe the Universal Elixir or toad venom pills to induce profuse sweating and dissipate the internal toxins. The next day, the swelling might subside, with or without pain; continue the insertion and application until the swelling rises and a root-like protrusion appears with surrounding cracks filled with pus, at which point stop the needle insertion. For mild cases, after nine days, the hardened disease root will be expelled. In cases of severe toxicity where it cannot fall off immediately, it may gradually rot into pus, a good method for converting the severe into the mild.

The affliction starts small and gradually becomes serious; initially, there is no pain, but over time it becomes noticeable.

Since the liver governs the muscles, it causes them to contract, forming hard knots that appear between the neck and muscles, resembling the hardness of chess pieces, varying in size, some recessed and others protruding. Over time, they can become hollow and produce both cold and heat; excessive labor and anger worsen the condition. Phlegm knots arise from improper regulation of food and drink, instability in hunger and satiety, and fluctuating emotions, leading to an inability of the spleen to transport and transform, resulting in phlegm accumulation. Initially, it resembles small plums or cherries on the body, turning slightly red over time, and eventually rupturing, which makes it easier to contain. In observing these symptoms, one should identify the wind and toxin; to disperse the wind and eliminate the toxin, remedies like \"Fang Feng Jie Du Tang\" are effective.

There were also lumps in his chest and sides, as large as a measuring cup; some broke open like fungus or pomegranate, regardless of size, all were treated with the previous method. A scholar named Jiang Jie had knots on his neck, arms, and ribs, and strictly took medicines to eliminate phlegm, reduce fire, and soften hardness, but to no avail. I said: This is a deficiency of liver and gallbladder blood, leading to dryness and heat. He persisted with the previous medicines, and by June of the following year, all knots had ruptured, with a pulse that was floating and large. I concluded that autumn's metal would become strong, while the liver's wood was being restrained, leading to no improvement. Eventually, this prediction came true. The son of the old minister Yang Shizhai, aged seventeen, suffered from tuberculosis, experiencing fever and thirst, with red cheeks in the afternoon and a large, floating pulse at the left wrist. This indicated a deficiency of liver and kidney yin. I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang for more than twenty doses, adding Ren Shen and Huang Qi for over twenty more doses, but it just ruptured. However, the pus was clear and watery, with no muscle growth.

One man had five hard tubercles below the ear for over a year; his complexion was sallow, appetite poor, and he experienced labor-induced fever. His pulse was rapid, soft, and weak. After taking over sixty doses of the Yi Qi Yang Rong decoction, his vital energy recovered, and the afflicted area healed, leaving one tubercle. A follow-up treatment with Bi Xiao San led to its resolution. Another individual developed a condition in front of and below the ear, which after recovery extended to the lateral neck and shoulder for three years, eventually spreading to the chest and armpits. Upon examination, his liver pulse was strong and rapid, and he was treated with Long Hui and San Jian pills. When he was about to recover, his liver pulse remained rapid.

However, he did not believe it and rashly took purgative medicines, leading to continuous vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in death. Generally, this condition was inherently one of deficiency; if one does not discern between deficiency and excess and violates the regulations regarding diseases, it is rare not to suffer dire consequences. Typically, treatment begins by regulating the menstrual cycle and relieving stagnation, and then using garlic moxibustion; many will resolve naturally. If not resolved, one should apply amber paste and, when there is pus, puncture it; otherwise, it may develop into another condition. If there are concomitant symptoms like phlegm or yin deficiency, one should only add agents for those symptoms and avoid interfering with other treatments. If the qi and blood have already recovered but the mass has not dissipated, using dispersive agents may be appropriate, even if it takes over a month without improvement—the qi and blood will not feel weakened. Then, dispersing agents may be applied. Alternatively, if one encounters medicinal pills of unmatched potency, if their toxicity is profound, both medications should be stopped. Next, a few doses of the Yi Qi Yang Rong Decoction can be used for adjustment. If the wound does not heal, one may use fermented soybean cakes or amber paste. If there is a deficiency in both qi and blood, or if one carelessly eats or has emotional disturbances, no treatment should be administered. Nonetheless, in this condition, qi is paramount; with robust qi and blood, it is unnecessary to pursue corrosive agents, as they can self-decompose, but one should ensure the process facilitates closure. If there is deficiency in qi and blood and one neglects to supplement first, while repeatedly using corrosive medicines, it is merely enough to invite failure.

This patient prioritized treating phlegm first, taking bitter and cold phlegm-transforming medicines, which were ineffective, and then additionally taking Qi-breaking medicines, worsening the condition. Initially, they used the Six Gentlemen Decoction, adding several doses of Szechuan lovage; with reduced appetite and thoughts, they supplemented with a modified Middle-Strengthening and Qi-Benefiting Decoction by doubling the amount of white atractylodes, which improved their energy over a month. Later, they employed the Qi-Benefiting and Nourishing Decoction, leading to a reduction in swelling and a return of blood and energy after four months. In this case, the tight pulse indicates an excess of wood, thus overpowering the spleen (earth) and acting as a harmful influence. Using bitter and cold medicines on a deficiency is a form of double deficiency. Moreover, phlegm can arise from various causes, necessitating different treatment methods.

It is because worry and contemplation harm the heart; when the heart is harmed, blood flows backwards and diminishes.

When the spleen is deficient, the metal energy is insufficient, leading to cough. When the water energy is exhausted, the limbs become dry.

Many physicians believe that the blood of a young woman is hot and hence treat it with cooling medicines. What they do not understand is that blood flows when it is heated and coagulates when it is cold. \"The Essential Formulas for Health Preservation\" mentions this in great detail; this principle is very valid and should not be overlooked. If the cycle becomes slightly irregular and gradually becomes obstructed, with the bones and flesh of the hands and feet becoming painful and emaciated, and gradually producing tidal fever, and the pulse becomes thin and rapid, this is due to deficiency of yin and weakness of blood, with yang overpowering it.

Liuqi Yin is a depleting medicine; if the qi is bound and the chest feels full, only two or three doses are advisable; more can harm the blood and qi, resulting in a worsening condition, and although there is Xiong and Gui, they are not reliable. Danxi noted: this is not a transformation of rich foods or damp toxins, but is caused by deficiency and qi stagnation."},{"anchor":"trans-164p","marker":"164p","type":"translation","text":"A woman suffered from a persistent abscess that would not heal, with clear pus not drying up. I treated her with Ba Zhen Tang, and she improved slightly; however, she suddenly experienced pain in her shoulders and back, making it impossible for her to turn her head. This was caused by stagnation in the bladder meridian, and should be treated with Fang Feng Tong Qi Tang. The bladder meridian begins at the inner canthus of the eye, crosses the forehead to the crown, descends near the ears, and then continues to the back of the head, passing down the neck to the shoulders, and extends down to the lower back. When the meridian's energy is disturbed, it results in back pain and a stiff neck, which clearly indicates a bladder meridian issue. She insisted that the abscess was related to the gallbladder meridian and that its path affects the sides of the neck; this implies that there is fire disturbance in the meridian. She then took herbal medicine to clear the liver and reduce fire, which caused her to lose her appetite and experience severe pain. She requested that I examine her pulse again, and I found her stomach energy had become weaker. I first prescribed Si Jun Zi Tang combined with Chen Pi, Chao Shao Yao, Ban Xia, Qiang Huo, and Man Jing Zi in four doses, which helped her eat and relieved her pain.

Further, she was given Bi Xiao San in two doses, which allowed the ulcer to close, but her vitality and blood remained unbalanced. After taking an additional thirty doses of the previous medicine, her condition stabilized. Later, Tian Sheng relied on this formula indiscriminately to treat others, not differentiating between those who were weak or strong, completely unaware that the ingredients included certain toxic substances, which though effective in treating scrofula, could deplete vital energy if used excessively. If a patient had excess vitality and blood, it would be appropriate to first use this to purge, and then follow up with tonics for recovery. However, if the patient was weak and purgative medicine was applied, or if corrosive medicine was used, while the stagnant flesh might be removed, the ulcer would not close properly, leading to difficulties in treatment. In Guangdong, Chen Fangbo's son, after a long and exhausting journey, developed a fever with a weak, large pulse and swelling beneath the ear, indicative of strain damage. Administering a restorative formula known as Zhong Yi Qi Tang naturally helped reduce the fever and swelling. If one were to focus excessively on detoxification, it could lead to further weakness. Despite this warning, the patient took fire-reducing medicine and Bi Xiao San, ultimately leading to vomiting, diarrhea, and death by starvation. Strain and exhaustion diminish vitality; as vitality declines, fire surges. The surging fire harms the spleen's function, resulting in weariness and fever, a sign of injured vital energy. Danxi stated: one should restore vitality and balance the meridians; only then would the sores heal on their own. Sweating or purging should not be done.

A woman aged twenty had a lump below her ear that corresponded with her menstrual cycle, experiencing headaches in the afternoon after her period started. The wind medicine she took only exacerbated her condition. I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang with the additions of Chai Hu and Di Gu Pi for over twenty doses, and she recovered.

I administered six doses of Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang which immediately alleviated her condition. Then, I used Sheng Yu Tang for several doses to promote recovery. Additionally, I prescribed Ba Zhen Tang with the additions of Bei Mu and Yuan Zhi for over thirty doses, leading to improvement. Dongyuan noted that symptoms of fever accompanied by heat, persistent thirst, agitation, and warm skin, together with a strong, weak pulse or symptoms like eye pain and dry nose, are not indicative of Bai Hu Tang syndrome, but rather blood deficiency causing agitation, to be principally addressed with Dang Gui Bu Xue Tang. Furthermore, for cases of internal heat with inability to eat, accompanied by spontaneous sweating and shortness of breath, one should use cooling remedies to drain heat and tonify qi.

The size of the abscess was significant, merely able to erupt but unable to develop into pus. Therefore, a dose of Shi Quan Da Bu Tang was prescribed, adding Jie Geng and Bai Zhi, with double portions of Ren Shen and Bai Zhu, each three qian. Externally, the mulberry wood moxibustion method was used, applied twice daily; also, Zi Xia Ointment was applied for several days.

Four days later, the sore reappeared, accompanied by swelling in the neck, rigidity, and deep purple pain, along with constipation. The pulse was firm and strong.
