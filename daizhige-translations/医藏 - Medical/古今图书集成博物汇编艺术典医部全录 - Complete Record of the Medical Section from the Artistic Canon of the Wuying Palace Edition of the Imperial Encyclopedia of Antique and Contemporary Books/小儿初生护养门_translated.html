      <div><p><strong>The Complete Collection of Medical Works, Volume 400</strong><br><strong>On the Care of Newborns</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the Precious Recipes</strong> (by Sun Simiao of the Tang Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Newborns Exiting the Womb</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, first wrap their fingers with cotton and wipe the bad blood and dark phlegm from the mouth and tongue; this is referred to as &quot;Jade Scale.&quot; If this is not done quickly, as soon as the child cries, various illnesses will enter the abdomen. </p>
<p>Once the child is born, they should be lifted immediately. If there is a delay, it can cause internal cold and rumbling in the belly. First, bathe the child, then cut the umbilical cord. The cord should not be cut with a knife; instead, someone should bite through it while wearing a thin piece of clothing, and warm air should be blown on it seven times. After that, wrap the remaining umbilical cord and ensure it reaches just above the child&#39;s feet; if it is too short, it can cause internal cold and lead to an imbalance in the child&#39;s stomach, often resulting in diarrhea. </p>
<p>If the cord is cut first and then the child is bathed, water remaining in the cord can cause abdominal pain.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>When the navel is fully cut, if there are many worms in the umbilical cord, it is essential to quickly remove them, or else they will enter the child&#39;s abdomen and cause illness. The umbilical cord cut for a child should be about six inches long. If it&#39;s too long, it will injure the flesh; if too short, it will injure the organs. If not cut at the proper time, and if the juice of the cord is not completely drained, the warmth will gradually diminish, leading to a natural coldness that causes umbilical wind in the child.</p>
<p>For a boy, it is advisable to wrap him in his father&#39;s old clothes. For a girl, use her mother&#39;s old clothes. Avoid using new silk as it is inappropriate. The clothing should not be too thick, as it could harm the skin, affect the blood vessels, and cause rashes or jaundice. Babies should wear cotton fabric but must avoid heavy and warm clothing. Be cautious! When a baby is first born, their skin has not fully developed, and dressing them too warmly will weaken their muscles and bones. They should be allowed to be exposed to the wind and sunlight periodically. If they are kept from the wind entirely, their skin will become fragile and soft, making them more susceptible to injury. Just a few layers of clothing should be sufficient, and new cotton should be avoided.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>When the weather is warm and calm, the mother should take the child to play in the sunlight. Seeing the wind and sun occasionally will help the blood flow and strengthen the body, making the flesh resilient enough to withstand cold winds, thus preventing illness. However, if the child is constantly kept inside a blanket, swathed in heavy clothing, it is akin to the plants in a shaded place that do not see sunlight; they become soft and fragile, unable to endure the wind and cold.</p>
<p>As for the wrapping of the navel, use soft white cloth that has been beaten to make it pliable, about four inches square. Combine it with thick cotton, half an inch in thickness, to match its softness and tightness. If it is too tight, it may cause the child to vomit. The child should have their navel exposed for the first twenty days after birth. During the wrapping process, ensure the tent is warm by having a fire, and the same goes for changing clothes. This is referred to as dealing with winter cold.</p>
<p>After the child has bathed and the navel has been cut, once wrapped securely, they should not be given honey immediately; it is better to give them licorice decoction.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Take a piece of licorice about the length of a finger, crush it, and boil it in two cups of water to obtain one cup of liquid. Dip a cotton cloth in it and let the child suck on it until the liquid is consumed. The child should quickly vomit to expel the harmful bile from the stomach. If the child manages to vomit, there is no need to administer more medicine. If the child cannot vomit, proceed with caution. If they show signs of hunger or thirst, give them some more medicine in small amounts. If the previous medicine or any subsequent doses cannot be vomited, only give them just enough to finish this one cup. If they manage to vomit out the harmful bile, it will ensure the child&#39;s spirit and mind are clear and healthy. If the child drinks a full cup and does not vomit, it indicates that the child does not have harmful blood, so do not administer licorice soup again; instead, give them red honey to soothe their spirit and calm their soul. For newborns under three days old, giving too much red honey is not advisable, as it can lead to a cold stomach, abdominal bloating, and cause convulsions that may result in death.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Newborn and Red Honey Formula: Use ground cinnabar about the size of a soybean, mix it with red honey and a clam shell, dip a cotton stick into it and let the child suck it; give three dips only, and ensure this dosage lasts for a day. If given for three days, use three soybeans&#39; worth. Do not exceed this, as it may harm the child. After administering the red honey, you may give cow bile in the same amount as the red honey. Cow bile benefits the liver and gallbladder, clears heat, calms the spirit, stops fright, wards off evil qi, and treats various ailments in children. </p>
<p>Three days after birth, the child&#39;s intestines and stomach should be opened to aid in digestion. You can grind rice to make a thick drink, similar to the thickness of yogurt, and give the child small amounts the size of a bean to swallow, repeating this three beans’ worth each time, three times a day. After seven days, it may be combined with breastfeeding.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>When the child is ten days old, they should begin to nurse like a jujube pit. By twenty days, double that amount; at fifty days, it should be like a small bullet; and by a hundred days, like a jujube. If the mother&#39;s milk is insufficient, do not use this method. Instead, gradually increase the amount. If nursing begins at thirty days, ensure the child is healthy. If a child nurses early, they cannot handle the complexities of grains, leading to illness, sores on the head and body that may heal and then recur, making the child weak and hard to nourish. After thirty days, do not overfeed, even if the child shows no appetite; do not force food if the child is unable to digest, as it will lead to further illness. </p>
<p>Generally, do not allow infants to become overly full, as they will vomit. If the child vomits, it indicates they are overfed; nurse them lightly until they digest. Feed four times a day. If the child&#39;s navel has not healed, overfeeding can make them vulnerable to wind. In summer, avoid giving warm milk to prevent vomiting; in winter, avoid cold milk to prevent coughing and diarrhea. A mother in a new house may find her infant too weak, unable to walk due to malnourishment.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>If a mother has heat, it affects her infant, causing them to turn yellow and unable to eat. If the mother is angry, it causes the infant to be easily startled, leading to gas and potentially driving them into a frenzy. If the mother has just vomited or is ill, it weakens the infant. If the mother is drunk, it causes the infant’s body to become hot and their belly to feel full. For all newborn infants, during the first month, it is best for them to drink pig&#39;s milk.</p>
<p>When breastfeeding, the wet nurse should first thoroughly knead out the heat, avoiding letting the milk flow out quickly to prevent choking the child. If the child chokes, the milk should be taken away to allow the child to breathe; once they have caught their breath, they can resume nursing. This should be repeated ten or five times, depending on the child&#39;s hunger and fullness, to understand how many times they should be fed in a day for it to become a routine. </p>
<p>Additionally, the wet nurse should routinely remove any leftover milk. If the child is lying down, the wet nurse should support the child’s head at the same level as the breast to prevent choking while nursing. If the mother feels sleepy, she should take away the breast, fearing that it may fill the child’s mouth and nose, not knowing whether they are hungry or full.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>Bathing Methods for Infants: When bathing an infant, it is crucial to ensure that the water is at a balanced temperature. If the water temperature is inappropriate, it can frighten the child and also lead to diseases of the internal organs. In winter, infants should not bathe for too long, as prolonged exposure can cause colds; in summer, they should also avoid lengthy baths, as this can cause overheating. Frequent bathing in cold water can result in convulsions; however, if not bathed, it may cause hair loss. For newborns, take the juice of one pig&#39;s bile and add it to the bath water, ensuring that they will not suffer from sores or scabies throughout their life; do not wash them with mixed water. On the third day after birth, it&#39;s advisable to bathe the child with peach root soup. Use two taels each of peach roots, plum roots, and apricot roots; branches can also be used. Crush them and boil in three buckets of water until it reaches a rolling boil, then strain it and use for bathing the infant, as it is effective for removing impurities and ensures a lifetime free from sores and scabies. To treat infant fright and ward off bad energy, bathe using mugwort and tiger bone soup. Use one pound of mugwort and one tiger skull, boiling them in three buckets of water for the bath. It is essential to use the soup immediately after boiling.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>The Confucian Approach to Parenting by Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Excessive Love for Infants Can Be Detrimental</strong></p>
<p>When infants are first born, their intestines and stomachs are delicate, easily hungry or full, easily weak or strong, and easily affected by cold or heat. This is well known, as stated in ancient texts. However, what is said in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; regarding proper conduct and in Wang Fu&#39;s &quot;Qianfu Lun&quot; is not widely understood. The &quot;Book of Rites&quot; states: A young boy should not wear a fur cloak. It is said that a fur cloak is too warm and can diminish vital energy. Moreover, a person becomes an adult at fifteen, yet is still not permitted to wear a fur cloak.</p>
<p>In today’s society, people raise young children by warmly wrapping them in cloth during the summer, ensuring they do not go without warmth, and as soon as the weather becomes slightly chilly, they close off the room tightly, lower curtains, heat the bed, and use a red stove, making sure that even a small chill does not invade while keeping warmth contained. Even elderly people cannot endure such conditions, let alone pure yang children! A gentleman should also not create such excessive warmth in a closed space.</p>
<p>Wang Fu&#39;s &quot;Qianfu Lun&quot; mentions that an infant&#39;s illness often arises from overeating. In today&#39;s child-rearing practices, people do not observe how much their infant&#39;s stomach can actually hold; upon hearing a cry, they jump to conclude the baby is hungry and quickly feed it milk, without consideration for moderation, resulting in continuous feeding without caution. As the child grows and begins to eat, they are fed at whatever cue the child gives. An infant, having no means of expression, relies solely on its cries for communication. These two practices are sources of numerous illnesses.</p>
<p>Apart from ailments caused by prenatal conditions, infants can suffer from four specific types of illnesses: fright, malnutrition, vomiting, and diarrhea.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The source of illness lies in two things: one is satiety, the other is warmth. Shock is caused by fire overpowering the liver&#39;s wind-wood. Diarrhea is caused by heat overpowering the spleen&#39;s damp-earth. Vomiting occurs when fire overwhelms the stomach diaphragm, and in severe cases, it rises upwards. Diarrhea happens when fire acts on the liver and large intestine. Breast milk, being formed from blood that undergoes transformation by metal and is extremely cold, nourishes the flesh of infants effectively. However, the body is primarily water; thus, excessive intake of milk can lead to damp accumulation, resulting in combined damp-heat, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. Physicians who do not understand this principle hastily prescribe medicinal foods such as purple frost, metallic elements, and white cakes, which contain colocynth and almonds. The colocynth is greatly hot and highly toxic, while the almond is mildly hot and slightly toxic. If infants with yang heat are given heat-toxic medicine, the toxins will remain and eventually cause transformation into illness. Therefore, Mr. Liu Hejian uses non-toxic medicines like Tongsheng, Liangge, Shenxiong, and Yiyuan to treat these issues. Some say: this is a medicine for adults, not suitable for infants. I laughed and replied: although adults and children differ in age and vigor, do the five organs and six bowels differ? Adults take more, children take less; the essence is the same. Hence, for those who should not be purged, detoxification is appropriate; for those who can be purged, regulation of the stomach and heart is necessary. Since there are methods to expel dampness, I have previously made pills from the powdered mixture of Qian Niuxin (Morning Glory), Dahuang (Rhubarb), and Mutong (Menispermum) to treat various ailments in children, and it has been effective. This is primarily due to the accumulation of damp-heat from the consumption of breast milk in infants.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Nowadays, many doctors criticize me for using this medicine. Since they do not understand the laws of nature, it is hard to argue with them. Therefore, I write this prescription for those in the future who are wise. However, those who are good at treating children should consider their wealth and status. In wealthy families, where there is an abundance of clothing and food, children often die young; in poor families, where there is a lack of food and clothing, children tend to grow strong. Children from poor families cannot indulge their desires, and though they may feel unsatisfied, they do not dare to express anger. Less anger leads to fewer liver ailments. In contrast, children from rich families can indulge their desires, and when things are slightly unsatisfactory, they become angry. More anger leads to more liver ailments. The liver corresponds to wood, and if it becomes excessive, it affects the spleen. Furthermore, poor families have limited resources and few medicines, leading to fewer deaths; rich families, with abundant wealth and medicines, face more deaths. Thus, although the upbringing in poor families may seem inferior compared to that in wealthy families, the successful growth of children in poorer families often surpasses that in wealthier ones. There are four principles that align with the natural way of raising children: 1) simple clothing and bland food, with few desires and little anger; 2) limited wealth and fewer medicines, allowing sickness to heal on its own, without being harmed by incompetent doctors and excessive heating tonics; 3) during pregnancy, the mother works, leading to the circulation of qi and blood, which nourishes the fetus; 4) when the mother works a lot, childbirth becomes easier. These four principles are contrary to those of wealthy families. There is a saying: &quot;When a child cries, it is a song; when they do not cry, they are not strong.&quot; This saying, though simple, touches upon the root of the issue: the common folks do not understand that crying is a way for children to release excess heat from their bodies.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Laozi said: &quot;Crying all day without losing my voice.&quot; I have once taught people the method of raising children: When the child can’t sit up yet, let them lie on a bare floor. In cold weather, do not give them thick clothes, just cloth, not cotton. When they can sit, use iron bells and wooden toys tied with thin strings, placed in a basin of water, to create sounds as they float and sink. During the hot summer, let them sit nearby, playing with water and the bells to dispel the heat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;The limbs are the foundation of all yang.&quot; If the hands are immersed in cold water, the yin energy reaches the heart; this is a remedy that requires no medicine. I once advised Chen Jingzhi: If a child is sick and there&#39;s no medicine, it is better to not use a mediocre doctor. However, I fear that the wife will blame him for not seeking treatment. It is advisable to soak and steam cakes to make them soft, forming them into small pills, deceiving the wife into thinking they are real medicine so the child can take them, and then leave things to fate; this is the best medicine.</p>
<p>In the year of Bingxu, many children fell ill with diarrhea, and those who used medicine all died. The reason is that the physicians did not understand the principles of dampness and heat, thus they treated with warmth and dryness, leading to death. Only Chen Jingzhi did not administer medicine and followed my advice, allowing the sick child to survive. Alas! Oh! Ban Gu truly a good historian once said: &quot;If one is sick and does not seek treatment, they receive traditional medicine. Avoiding violence can alleviate major illnesses; those who take medicine should be careful and familiarize themselves with yin and yang, without conspiring with others. Before sickness appears, following my methods of nurturing will also prevent illness. Even if there is a slight ailment, it is possible to avoid taking medicine.&quot;<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Nurturing the Young</strong></p>
<p>Before the age of sixteen, one&#39;s vital energies are robust, like the sun rising or the moon nearing fullness; however, the yin is still insufficient, and the stomach and intestines are delicate and narrow. Therefore, the method of nurturing must be approached with caution. Young boys should not wear fur or silk clothing, as the sayings of ancient sages indicate. Clothing for the lower body should be made of materials that are warmer and softer than cloth; fur garments provide warmth and softness beyond what silk can offer. The lower body corresponds to yin; if it becomes cold, the yin can easily grow, while warmth can dissipate the darkness of yin. Hence, if the lower body is not attired in thick, warm silk or similar materials, it may hinder the vital energies. This is a solid argument.</p>
<p>With abundant energy, digestion is easier, and thus eating occurs without set times. However, as the stomach and intestines remain delicate and narrow, foods that are sticky, dry, hard, sour, salty, sweet, spicy, as well as all fish, meat, fruit, and moist noodles, should be strictly avoided, especially those that are heating and difficult to digest. Instead, one should consume cooked vegetables and plain congee, which not only prevent illness but also help in cultivating virtue. Additionally, roasted chestnuts with a salty flavor and dried persimmons, which are cool in nature, can assist in nurturing yin.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>However, chestnuts are too astringent, and persimmons are too rich; both are difficult to digest and should be given sparingly. Women, lacking knowledge, only focus on indulgence, fearing their children’s cries and giving them whatever they want. This accumulates into illnesses, and once regret sets in, it is too late! Hence, those who are wealthy and indulge their children often find them sickly. By the time they reach adulthood, their muscles and bones are weak, and they cannot restrict their diet to nourish themselves properly. During mourning, they cannot adhere to vegetarian practices to fulfill their obligations. If they neglect minor details, they may compromise on greater principles; should one not be cautious?</p>
<p>As for the nursing mother, she should be especially prudent. Food that is swallowed affects the milk; emotional disturbances resonate in the milk’s flow. If sickness affects the milk, it will stagnate, and the child who consumes it will become ill—either vomiting or having diarrhea, or suffering from sores or fever, or experiencing night terrors or abdominal pain. At the onset of illness, the child&#39;s urine will be scant. The mother must inquire and adjust her care according to the symptoms; if the mother is well, then the child also will be well, thus preventing problems before they arise. The selection of food is a minor concern, yet the nursing mother’s condition—whether thin or rich, her temperament being soft or urgent, the strength or fragility of her bones, and her moral character—are all significant factors in how closely the child resembles her.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Moxibustion Methods</strong></p>
<p>Newborn infants are generally without ailments; one must be cautious not to apply moxibustion in the reverse manner. If moxibustion is done inversely, it causes pain and disrupts their vital channels, potentially leading to diseases. The region of He and Luo has a cold climate, causing infants to commonly suffer from spasms. For those born in this area, it is advisable to use moxibustion in reverse for the first three days to prevent this, as well as on the cheeks to guard against lockjaw. In cases of lockjaw, there will be a rapid pulse under the tongue and tightness in the gums. Due to the coldness of that land, blood should be drawn from under the tongue; thus, applying moxibustion to the cheeks prevents lockjaw. In the warmer climates of Wu and Shu, such ailments do not occur. Ancient methods have been handed down, yet contemporary practitioners often lack thorough understanding. Due to the differences between northern and southern regions, blindly following formulas can harm infants. Therefore, rural children, left to nature, generally thrive without complications. In cases where infants cry out in surprise and their limbs move restlessly during sleep, and their fever has not resolved, one must be extremely careful not to perform reverse moxibustion on the tips of their fingers, as it may disturb their vital channels and lead to seizures. Only in cases of inferred seizures and lockjaw is it permitted to apply moxibustion on the fingertips.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Remarkable Effects of Good Remedies</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Fang Xian]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Newborn Care</strong></p>
<p>When a baby is born, before bathing, wrap them in soft cotton and keep them warm in the adult&#39;s embrace. The bathwater must be well-adjusted; if it&#39;s too hot or too cold, it will shock the baby and cause internal ailments. Even when bathing is complete, the baby should still be kept warm. During hot months, do not remove the cotton wrappings. Having just emerged from the womb, the baby must not be exposed to cold air. It is advisable to pre-prepare boiled water and keep it in a bottle, gently warming it as needed to avoid exposure to cold water, preventing sores from arising. If followed for a month, this method will promote healthy growth and reduce illness.</p>
<p>Before the baby is breastfed, use a small amount of Huanglian (Coptis) infused juice and mix it with dried red pigment on a shell to apply to the baby&#39;s mouth, clearing the remnants of old feces from their stomach. Only then should breastfeeding be introduced. Within three days, add a little vermilion to honey, mixing it into half a shell to administer. After one month, apply a small amount of niuhuang (cattle gall) gradually to the baby&#39;s mouth. If the baby salivates excessively, do not force them to breastfeed.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>When bathing newborns, use a medicinal bath made from five herbs: peach, willow, neem, plum, and pagoda tree, along with brewed soups of苦参 (bitter vine) and白芷 (angelica) to ward off misfortune. During hot weather, use soft silk to dab the herbal soup on them.</p>
<p>Infants&#39; skin is still developing, so they should not wear warm clothing, as warmth may weaken their muscles and bones. They should often be exposed to sunlight and fresh air; if they are overly protected from the elements, their skin may become delicate and easily injured. It is advisable to dress them in old clothes previously worn by parents, to benefit from the residual warmth of the parents, and avoid new cotton garments. Additionally, be mindful of the clothing; too many layers can lead to excessive sweating, which may cause weakness and make them susceptible to illness.</p>
<p>Parents should be cautious of wind exposure to the child&#39;s neck area between the muscles, as many illnesses can arise from this region. Infants whose umbilical cords have not yet fallen off should not be bathed frequently, as water can enter the navel, causing complications known as &quot;navel wind.&quot; This advice is based on the teachings of our ancestors and should serve as a guide for future generations.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p>
<h3>The Theory of Harmony</h3>
<p>The Book says: When Yang rises and Yin increases, the four seasons do not differ. All things derive their essence from the dual forces of Yin and Yang, and men and women are formed from their vital fluids. After three cycles, the Yin energy becomes pure and rich; the child is referred to as an infant. After two months, as Yin energy begins to flourish, the child is referred to as a sprout. At a hundred days, they are named with a star of nourishment, and after half a year, they gain strength. During the time when infants are nursed, Yin and Yang balance each other. After a thousand days, the vital essence is fully developed. At this point, the role of the wet nurse is crucial; if she can harmonize, all is well; if not, there is conflict. Moreover, harmony comes from a kind mother who can adjust to the cold and heat, nursing appropriately. Thus, all ailments are swiftly relieved, their appearance becomes pleasing, their bones and muscles strong, and their disposition exceptional.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>Those who violate this will lose the proper rhythm of breastfeeding and will be unable to manage it. They may get angry with the infant, causing the child to become unruly; or they may drink while nursing, causing the child to become frightened and suffer fits; or while pregnant and nursing, leading the child to become jaundiced and emaciated; or they may suffer from illnesses, causing the child to have convulsions and unusual ailments; or they may vomit after nursing, resulting in the child vomiting and becoming thin; or they may overfeed the child, leading to excessive heat and rapid breathing; or they may be unsteady in their duties as wet nurses, causing the child to become ill; or the wet nurse sleeping with the child, where the breath from their mouths and noses affects the child&#39;s nose, leading to nasal congestion; or excessive maternal affection leading to tightly bound clothing, which causes additional coldness and excess heat, resulting in the child suffering from fevers, wind toxins, and skin diseases. Additionally, there are situations where the wet nurse leaves the child’s clothing under the moonlight to dry overnight, where droppings from birds fall on the clothes, thus resulting in unfortunate diseases; or if they play with strange objects that frighten the child when seen suddenly, leading to shock. The Book states: &quot;Clothes laid under the moon invite unwarranted calamities; children, not fully formed, may suffer from contact with rare objects.&quot; All these are due to the mother’s mistakes, causing the child to lose essence and blood, leading to a darkened complexion and weakened limbs, ultimately contributing to illness and death. Thus, the Inner Canon does not record any discourse on the diseases of infants being nursed; those serious ailments are unfounded.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>In the Middle Ages, the Wu Fang clan composed the &quot;Lú Hán Jing&quot; to predict longevity and mortality, passing it down through generations. Thus, pediatric medicine began to flourish. Following this, during the Jin and Song dynasties, various medical practices from the Su family were transmitted with proven efficacy in Jiangnan. In the Sui dynasty, the Chao family compiled the &quot;Bing Yuan,&quot; while in the Tang dynasty, Master Sun paid special attention to this field. Eventually, many talented physicians emerged, and renowned doctors became numerous. However, pediatric treatments are scattered across various texts. Despite extensive research on numerous writings, methods of treatment are often absent, offering only evidence without practical approaches. Zhang Huan provided formulas but lacked information on pulse diagnosis, while only the works of the Qian family are esteemed by both ancient and modern practitioners. It is said that the pulse of children is inherently difficult to verify and cannot be defined merely by language, particularly for infants and small children. Therefore, it focuses on one specific discipline. Ancients remarked on the difficulty of medicine, and in this pediatric field, practitioners can be significantly more advanced than general physicians. Although individuals vary in age, their ailments are similar, yet young children cannot express themselves. There are four hundred forty forms of diseases, and if one can adjust them, life is sustained; if harmony is lost, death ensues.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The young blame their mothers, while the grown may suffer due to the four seasons and seven emotions, or from hunger, fullness, labor, and rest, or from desires leading to errors, all of which can result in illness. In ancient times, when the divine farmer ruled the world, he observed people&#39;s disharmony and tasted the flavors of plants to determine salty, sour, sweet, and bitter, in order to treat diseases and chronic ailments. Salt softened, sourness astringed, sweetness eased, and bitterness strengthened. Remarkably, the pungent flavor encompassed all four qualities. He then sowed a hundred grains to nourish the human body. Ancient practices of residing in nests or caves did not obscure their path, allowing them to maintain their form and return to essence, guarding themselves through the Way, with strong and resilient vital energy and blood. Thus, they could preserve their lives for a hundred years. Consequently, skilled physicians emerged in succession without end. Qi and He were prominent at the forefront, while Li and Hua made their names known afterward. Alas, in modern times, deception and craftiness have increased, resulting in premature deaths. Even with enlightened physicians continuing through the ages, their diagnoses often bring little effect. Engaging in excessive rituals and seeking false blessings is like trying to find brightness in the dark or rowing a boat through a dry ravine; though one desires to live, they encounter dangers instead. Ultimately, those who seek to sustain life must understand the principles of harmony and discord, for then the mandate of heaven is boundless.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>A Heartfelt Letter on the Refinement of Nature</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Guidance of Raising Children</strong></p>
<p>The art of raising children is often called the &quot;Mute Discipline.&quot; When they cannot speak and pulses show no signs, we can only rely on their physical appearance for guidance. Thus, those who are good at nurturing children treat them as they would a nurturing dragon; while those who are poor at it do so as one would pet a calf with affection. The more care you provide, the greater the harm can become. At times, a child’s head may be warm while their feet are cold; they may cry often but refuse to feed. A slight deviation can lead to significant missteps. Their intestines and stomach are delicate, easily harmed by food; their muscles and bones are weak, easily affected by wind and cold. What do parents know, as they cling to the notion of tradition? Heavy blankets and thick clothing may inadvertently consume the yang energy while exhausting the yin; careless feeding and overflow of food only ruin the spleen and damage the stomach. Unfamiliar sounds and sights may lead to carelessness; one may confine a child too much within the home while limiting their outings excessively. Premature attempts to make them stand are taken as signs of growth; laughing and playing without purpose is mistaken for cleverness. Yet, once illness strikes, the parents are filled with anxiety. They trust shamans over doctors, seeking spirits rather than remedies. Such failures in human responsibility are mistakenly attributed to fate.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Secrets of Infant Care</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty, Wan Quan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Poem on Subtlety</strong></p>
<p>The art of medicine is vast, yet pediatrics is the most challenging. Like the tender sprout, it thrives on careful nurturing; like the silkworm’s shoot, it requires cautious preservation. When blood and energy have not yet filled them, their pulses cannot be diagnosed; when their awareness has not yet awakened, their mouths cannot articulate. Truly seeking in one’s heart, observing closely on the surface. If one grasps the essentials, they can wield transformation in skilled hands; if one fails to understand the intent, they merely extract phrases from fragmented texts. If care is misplaced, illness will arise. The head must be kept cool while the back needs warmth, food should not be plentiful and clothing should not be too soft. The intestines and stomach are delicate; overfeeding can lead to accumulation; if the spirit is timid and frail, strange sights and sounds can induce spasms. Alas, kind mother, you are too indulgent; laughing at those who are clumsy, you err with ineffective remedies. Sapping the essence of growth, you stifle the years of youth. Merely wailing in the fields, cease worship at the altars.</p>
<p><strong>Children Should Not Be Recklessly Treated with Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>Tender buds cannot endure harm; do not recklessly try acupuncture or remedies. Breaking flesh and damaging tendons lead to thinness and illness; spoiling intestines and harming stomachs cause lasting misfortunes. Newly born infants are fragile inside and out; they certainly cannot tolerate medicinal stones or acupuncture. Good practitioners should care for others&#39; children as they would their own, treating them gently, caressing them; do not take light actions to avoid causing misfortune. The text states: &quot;To protect the infant is to nurture it with love.&quot; Parents must bear this in mind.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>Care for them by being cautious of their fears</p>
<p>Young children are naturally weak in spirit. They may suddenly encounter unusual sights, unfamiliar people, sounds of roosters crowing or dogs barking, or see cattle and horses, and be startled or frightened by playful activities. They might hear calls and shouts from others, or the thunderous sounds of explosions, and it is impossible for them not to be disturbed, leading to illness due to fright. The heart stores the spirit, and fright damages the spirit; the kidneys store will, and fear causes loss of will. This holds true for all adults, but is even more pronounced in children. When children are playing, they must not be allowed to recklessly point at objects and imagine them to be insects or snakes. If a child cries, they should not be deceived by disguises to stop their crying, as it can confuse their spirit, making them timid and fearful. One must be cautious.</p>
<p>Children should play with things within reach; these should not be taken away from them. However, they must not be allowed to handle knives or swords, carry money, or be near water or fire, and they should not see spirits or ghosts. </p>
<p>When children begin to speak, they should be taught proper language and not be allowed to use vulgar expressions. If they can eat, they should be taught to do so respectfully, avoiding rudeness. If they can sit or walk, they should be supported to prevent falls. Relatives and community members should teach them to understand the distinctions of kinship, respect, and the hierarchy of age and seniors, ensuring they do not behave disdainfully.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>In verbal exchanges, teach honesty, and do not allow deceit to arise. In hosting guests, teach how to bow and greet, and do not permit them to withdraw. When it comes to clothing, tools, grains, and livestock, when encountering these matters, provide instruction so they come to understand. Teach them numbers, measurements, and the passage of days and seasons. Thus, not only will there be no illness, but knowledge will flourish early.</p>
<p>For children who are a year old and ill, do not recklessly use medicines; instead, adjust their nurse. If absolutely necessary to use medicine, it must be the correct one for the illness. Once the symptoms lessen, do not exceed the prescribed treatment.</p>
<p>In pediatrics, there are methods involving pinching; this is a variation of massage. For infants under a year old, it is difficult to treat them with medicine. Only those practices that address external ailments may be suitable; they cannot cure internal diseases. Treating minor ailments or excessive energy as if they were serious or deficient conditions will surely harm the child. What blame lies with parents who delight in pinching but detest medicines, leading to premature death?</p>
<p>Parents often cherish their young children, but sometimes love can turn into worry and distress. Caring for infants involves few secret methods; one must endure a measure of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Those without children may seek concubines, search for remedies, consult diviners, and pray to deities, yet their hearts are troubled.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>When a child is born, the depth of love and care can lead to neglect in their upbringing. If the care is excessive, it can create a hot environment; if they are overfed, it can lead to accumulation. A physician cannot choose an excellent remedy, as sometimes a harmful poison cannot be saved from. Liu Zhi in &quot;The Transmission of Growing Trees&quot; states that although it is said to love, in reality, it can cause harm. This is taken as a metaphor. </p>
<p>A saying goes: If you want a child to be peaceful, they should often experience a bit of hunger and cold. Hunger refers to moderating their diet, while cold means adapting to a suitable temperature, implying they should not be too full or too warm; this is not an erroneous claim of not feeding or not clothing. </p>
<p>The head should be kept cool and the back warm, exposing the lower body to nurture the true yin. One should not violate the seasons; during spring, cold and heat should not conflict with the body’s natural conditions. </p>
<p>This describes the method of adjusting temperature. The head is where the six yang energies converge and must remain cool, not bundled up. The abdomen represents yin and the back represents yang; both should be warm and protected from exposure. A child&#39;s pure yang energy lacks yin, so the lower body should be exposed to connect with the earth’s energy to nourish their yin. The seasons also refer to cold and heat. Spring represents a gentle and warm atmosphere, which all living things rely on for growth. This means that in swaddling, cold should not harm the cold, and heat should not harm the heat, so that the child can grow in a pleasant and mild environment like that of spring.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>If there are deviations, the invasion of cold and hot energies will come. Milk transforms into blood, beautiful like syrup; though meat and grains are delicious, they disturb the true essence. When it comes to eating, one should not indulge in excess and harm the spleen and yin. This refers to the principle of moderation in diet. While a child is in the womb, it relies on blood for nourishment. Once born, the milk, also transformed from blood, is vital. Although grains and meats exist, they should not be given, as they would disturb the harmony in the stomach and intestines. When able to eat, moderation is even more essential, for indulging in desires to please the heart can lead to illness. The Inner Canon states: excessive eating harms the stomach and intestines. One must be cautious.</p>
<p>The spirits of the ears and eyes reside in the heart, and unusual sights and sounds can easily provoke fear. Phlegm arises from counterflow of qi and can result in convulsions, causing lifelong regret and leading to a wasted life.</p>
<p>A wet-nurse must be chosen from healthy women, selecting those who are strong and of balanced temperament. One should not be greedy for food or indulge in desires, for how can one expect a child to thrive under such conditions?</p>
<p>The path of nurturing a child requires selecting a wet-nurse who is certainly healthy, with rich and abundant flesh, and a gentle temperament, as her milk will be thick, sweet, pure, and warm, benefiting the child. If the wet-nurse is cold, her milk will be cold; if she has sores, her milk will be toxic; if she is greedy, the taste will not be pure; if she indulges in desires, the qi will not be clear. What benefit can this bring to the child? Thus, it is advisable to stay away from such individuals.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>Preventing Illness Before It Emerges</strong></p>
<p>The navel is situated between the two kidneys, connecting to the three vessels of the stomach. Upon a child&#39;s birth, the cutting and care of the navel must be done with extreme caution. Therefore, at the time of cutting the navel, doing it through clothing is the best method; cutting it with fire is the next best; using scissors and then cauterizing it is the least favorable. </p>
<p>For the care of the navel: once it is cut, wrap it in a soft cloth and allow it to fall off naturally when dry; avoid getting it wet. During the three days after birth, when washing the baby, take care to keep water from touching the navel. After the navel has fallen, change the swaddling cloth frequently to prevent urine from wetting it. By following this careful approach, one can avoid the condition known as &quot;navel wind.&quot; The so-called expert treats illnesses before they arise, achieving perfect success.</p>
<p>Children&#39;s ailments can be attributed to three main causes: clothing that is too thick causes overheating, while clothing that is too thin leads to chill; these are external factors. If there is too much milk, the child feels full; if there is too little, the child feels hungry; these variations are internal causes. Additionally, external factors such as being affected by evil influences or falling and getting hurt also contribute to illness. </p>
<p>By aligning with the seasonal weather and adjusting to its warmth or cold, one can avoid issues arising from temperature extremes. Careful selection of a wet nurse and regulating her diet help prevent any problems associated with hunger and fullness. Care and attention in nursing are essential to avoid neglect. Be especially cautious not to allow incompetent doctors to recklessly administer medications, as it may harm the child&#39;s life.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Infant&#39;s Hundred Questions</strong> <em>(Ming Dynasty, Ru Boxi)</em></p>
<p><strong>Birth</strong></p>
<p>When an infant is in the womb, it receives the energies of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements, thus forming the Five Visceral Organs and Six Bowels. The entire body is fully developed, and it must rely on amniotic fluid for nourishment. Once the qi is sufficient, natural birth follows. Upon leaving the mother&#39;s body, the infant may have toxic fluids in the mouth and may not cry immediately, so it is essential to quickly use soft cloth to wipe away the foul juices from the mouth. Although this is a good method, in hurried situations, some may not do it properly. The ancients had methods involving huanglian (Coptis), zhumi (honey), and licorice, which are particularly effective. This prevents the ingestion of harmful substances that settle in the heart. When exposed to seasonal ailments, if such toxins persist due to warmth, they can spread through the bloodstream, overflow into the stomach, and since the stomach governs muscle, this may manifest as sores and rashes. No one, young or old, can escape this. If one follows the method of wiping the mouth at birth, they may avoid the affliction of pox and rashes. Sometimes, if seasonal illnesses invade, only superficial skin ailments manifest, which can be easily managed—this is indeed fortunate for the child. Yang said: if the mouth is not wiped at birth and impurities enter the stomach, this can lead to abdominal fullness and shortness of breath, preventing the infant from breastfeeding; in such cases, one should use a modified formula with Poria pills for treatment. Moreover, to expel fetal toxins during labor, drinking a concentrated decoction of light fermented soybean juice is excellent, but one must avoid substances like cinnabar, huanglian, and light powder.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Nurturing Method</p>
<p>When a baby is newly born, their skin is not yet firm, and they should not be dressed in warm clothing. Only thin clothing should be used, ensuring the back is kept warm. This thin clothing method should be adopted from autumn; one must not abruptly reduce clothing in spring or summer, as this could invite wind and cold. Thus, following the adaptation from autumn allows for gradual acclimatization to cold. In winter, wearing two thin garments is sufficient to endure the cold; if it feels too cold, a slight addition is acceptable. However, if one excessively warms them out of love, it may actually be harmful. </p>
<p>Moreover, one must pay attention to the baby&#39;s condition, ensuring they do not sweat. If sweating occurs, it indicates a weakness on the surface, making them susceptible to external wind evil. Whether awake or asleep, one should always be cautious. The breastfeeding method should also be regulated to avoid overfeeding. If there is stagnation and inability to digest, one should use breast milk pills or other remedies to transform accumulated heat and strengthen the spleen. As Chen states: endure a slight chill, eat moderately, rub the belly frequently, bathe infrequently, and ensure the back, belly, and feet are warm while keeping the head and chest cool; this advice holds true.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>On Infant Feeding and Illness</strong></p>
<p>When infants suffer, their mothers are to blame. Before birth, they fail to be cautious with their diet; after birth, they are unable to provide proper care. Hence, they only seek to indulge the child, neglecting to prevent minor issues from becoming significant problems. Some children are given sour or salty foods before they reach the age of one hundred days, or rich and fatty foods before they are even a year old, leading to various illnesses: vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, malnutrition, abdominal swelling, edema, malaria, dysentery, and wheezing. Are these not the results of excessive eating and inappropriate dietary adjustments?</p>
<p><strong>On Medication for Newborns</strong></p>
<p>I foolishly suggest that for infants within the first month or so, tonic medicines should be administered in doses of two to three spoonfuls. For dispersing or attacking medicines, only a spoonful should be given at a time; too much will harm their vital energy. Dosages should be adjusted according to the size and condition of the child. If the mother is ill and it affects the child, the focus should be on treating the mother, and the child should receive minimal medication. Later treatments should follow this principle.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Method of Initial Birth</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, if they have blood clots in their mouth, it is crucial to clean this before they cry. Use a soft cloth wrapped around the finger to wipe away the blood, and then administer a mixture of Huang Lian (Coptis), Dou Chi (Fermented Soybeans), Zhusha (Cinnabar), honey, and licorice to detoxify. However, Huang Lian is cold in nature; if the mother has consumed rich foods that generate heat, it is appropriate to use it. Conversely, if the child is weak and has a bland constitution, it is not advisable. While Zhusha can effectively detoxify, it has a tendency to anchor one down, so it is better to use Niuhuang (Cattle Gallstone) in moderation mixed with honey for sucking. Many in the world use Xijiao (Rhinoceros Horn) detoxification pills, but for those with weak and cold vital energy, these can harm the spleen and stomach, potentially leading to infertility. Additionally, if an infant suffers from a difficult birth or is exposed to wind and cold, the umbilical cord should not be cut hastily. Quickly warm cotton and cradle the child, placing the placental tissue over fire to gently heat, and apply burning paper around the umbilical cord to bring warmth into the abdomen, allowing the vital energy to recover swiftly. Bathing should especially be avoided, as it may disrupt the pulse and lead to the escape of the original qi, making the child susceptible to external pathogens.</p>
<p><strong>Method of Nurturing</strong></p>
<p>Upon birth, it is essential for the wet nurse to be cautious about emotional disturbances and rich flavors. If the milk is pure and calm, the child will be healthy. Otherwise, imbalances in yin and yang can lead to turbulent blood and qi, spoiling the milk, which will surely result in various ailments. Frequent use of medications may harm the internal organs and lead to serious complications that should not be overlooked. Generally, the method of caring for infants is to adjust and care for the wet nurse when the child is healthy and to carefully treat the infant when they are unwell, always ensuring the mother is also treated effectively.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Medical Guidelines: Initial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Tian Shi says: Generally, when infants are too warm, it causes heat; excessive heat leads to wind; holding them excessively results in sores; feeding them improperly leads to afflictions. Caution is especially necessary. Qian explains: Feeding milk after great joy often leads to convulsions; feeding milk after intense crying often causes vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Treatises</strong></p>
<p>Wang Yinjun states: For infants, after sixty days, their pupils begin to form, and they can start responding to human emotions. From this onset of recognition, parents and elders should gradually guide them in appropriate behavior. Servants and maids should not be allowed to train the child in mock dances, disrespect, shouting, or rough pushing and dodging. Even if the child appears to smile, they may be frightened and distressed, leading to an unruly temperament. If a wet nurse indulges in rich flavors and strong alcoholic essences, the infant also absorbs this through milk, resulting in various ailments. When sick, they should avoid bitter and spicy medications. Indulgence and tolerance can lead to serious issues. The mother&#39;s affection, often excessive, manifests in the food she craves, allowing the child to overindulge, leading to harm. In my childhood, I had a strong taste for sweet confections, but one day I discovered a worm emerging from a sweet treat, after which I could not bring myself to eat sweets. Only upon growing up did I understand the reasons for such caution. If not, persistent ailments will deepen and become difficult to remedy, causing irreparable harm.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Nurturing</strong></p>
<p>The text from &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; states: A child&#39;s bones form after two hundred forty days, so the mother should teach them to crawl. By the end of a week, the mother should support them to walk. This is all proper training. If one were to dress them in heavy clothing, keep them from sunlight and fresh air, preventing contact with the earth, it could lead to weak muscles and bones, causing some children to be unable to walk for years. Observing children in rural areas reveals the opposite; they benefit from exposure to sunlight and fresh air, keeping their muscles strong. Isn&#39;t this principle independent of wealth or status? Understanding this leads to the proper methods of child-rearing.</p>
<p><strong>Breastfeeding</strong></p>
<p>The methods of breastfeeding must be approached with caution. Infants have weak spleens and stomachs, and are easily harmed by food. Initial vomiting and diarrhea can cause long-term digestive issues. The diet of the wet nurse affects the breast milk; if she eats hot food, the milk becomes hot; if she eats cold food, the milk becomes cold. Consuming hot milk in summer can cause vomiting, while cold milk in winter may lead to cough and diarrhea. The mother should avoid anger; anger raises her Qi and causes chaos; she should avoid drunkenness as well, since it creates heat and abdomen pain. During pregnancy and while nursing, if care is not taken, it can lead to a yellowish and emaciated appearance, with a swollen abdomen and soft feet, referred to as &quot;bile disease.&quot; Generally, breastfeeding should not be excessive. A saying goes: &quot;Children often fall ill from overeating.&quot; It is also advised: &quot;Endure a little hunger, eat until seven parts full.&quot; This is indeed a wise principle.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Elimination of Fetal Toxins</strong></p>
<p>The medical texts all state: When a newborn emerges from the womb and before it cries out, one should quickly use cotton to wipe away the foul fluid from its mouth. This is indeed a good practice; however, in urgent situations, there may be times one cannot do this. Thus, methods using ingredients like Coptis, licorice, vermilion, honey, etc., can be especially beneficial. Dongyuan says: Simply brew a decoction of light fermented soybean and give it to the child, three to five mouthfuls. The toxins will be expelled naturally, and it can also help with the stomach energy, which is particularly wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Newborns</strong></p>
<p>For newborns, it is essential to avoid contact with outsiders. The ancients believed that for the first year of life, children should not be exposed to guests to prevent any undue harm. Children who can recognize people should not be taken to temples to view the flickering images of deities, as this may instill fear. As summer approaches, sew seven peeled apricot kernels into a sachet for the child to carry with them, which will help them remain calm during thunder.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Pig&#39;s Milk</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Huan argues: At birth, if the mother has not yet produced milk, pig&#39;s milk can be used as a substitute, preventing seizures, itchy skin, and pox. Qian&#39;s theory states: For newborns up to a month old, it is best to frequently give them droplets of pig&#39;s milk. According to the &quot;Senghui Formulas,&quot; to obtain pig&#39;s milk, the piglet must first be allowed to suckle from its mother. Then, one should lift the hind legs of the sow so that the piglet releases its latch. Quickly squeeze out the milk by hand; this is the only proper method to obtain it.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Bathing Method</strong></p>
<p>For infants, the umbilical cord should not be cut before bathing; it should be cut afterward to prevent water from wetting the stump, which could avoid issues like umbilical wind and sores. Use clean oil mixed with ash to protect the umbilical area. Do not let water get the umbilical cord wet during bathing.</p>
<p><strong>Umbilical Cord Cutting Method</strong></p>
<p>Generally, after the umbilical cord is cut at birth, it should be wrapped in moxa for protection. If the wet nurse is not careful, or if bathing water gets into the cord, or if urine is trapped in the wraps, moisture can injure the cord. Furthermore, exposure to cold and wet air can lead to the infant’s cord swelling and excessive crying, preventing them from breastfeeding, which results in umbilical wind.</p>
<p><strong>Clothing Method</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Shenghui,&quot; clothing for infants within the first month should be made from old fabric and not from new cotton. If new cotton is used, it may cause the infant to become overheated or lead to seizures.</p>
<p><strong>Clothing Drying Method</strong></p>
<p>Generally, infants’ clothes should be dried in the sun during the day and taken inside at night; they should not be left outdoors overnight. Wearing clothes that have been exposed to dew can cause dampness and heat, making the infant uncomfortable. This is known as the harm of the Eight Evils, which if prolonged, can lead to jaundice, weight loss, abdominal pain, excessive heat at night, crying, or the development of sores or scabs. Commonly, people refer to these conditions as &quot;innocent illnesses,&quot; attributing them to clothes left outside overnight accumulating harmful substances, but this is misguided. The ancients referred to the Eight Evils as being influenced by warmth, cold, fright, and imbalanced feeding.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Methods for Raising Children</strong></p>
<p>Eating hot, soft, and in moderation prevents illness; eating cold, hard, and in excess leads to sickness. Endure a bit of cold, eat until moderately full. Frequently rub the abdomen, and bathe less. A verse says: To keep children safe through the seasons, maintain a state of slight hunger and chill. If everyone follows this method, naturally, illnesses will not concern them.</p>
<p><strong>Ten Principles for Raising Children</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep the back warm. The classics say: The two sides below the third vertebra of the back correspond to the lungs. If wind and cold harm the lung area, it causes the hair to stand upright, skin to close, resulting in heat-related illnesses. Symptoms may include cough, shortness of breath, nausea, or chest fullness with cold and heat, all from cold affecting the lung meridian. Therefore, keep the back warm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep the abdomen warm. There is a saying: A cold belly means a cold stomach. The abdomen is the stomach, the sea of water and grains. If cold, food will not digest, leading to abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. The classics say: A warm stomach can digest grains; thus, keep the abdomen warm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep the feet warm. The classics state: The feet govern the yangming stomach meridian. Cold arises from below, so the feet must be warm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep the head cool. The classics say: The head is where the six yang converge and gather all yang energy.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The head is the sea of marrow; if exposed to great heat, the marrow overflows, leading to sweating and leakage. This can cause swelling of the skull, openings in the sutures, or sores and eye ailments. It is commonly said that &quot;the head cannot be too cool.&quot; Therefore, the head should be kept cool.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, the heart and chest must also be kept cool. The heart is associated with fire; if it encounters external heat while internal heart fire is present, both inside and outside will become hot. If the symptoms are mild, there may be dry mouth and parched tongue, flushed cheeks, and a reddened face. If severe, there may be crying, agitation, and jumping. Thus, the heart should be kept cool.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the spirit is not whole, young children may suddenly see something extraordinary, an unfamiliar person, or hear the crowing of a rooster or barking of a dog. They might unexpectedly see cattle or horses, play in fear, or suddenly hear loud noises, leading to involuntary responses. This happens due to a deficiency in the heart&#39;s qi, causing the spirit to disperse. It is advisable to use tonifying heart and qi medicines for treatment. However, if using sedative medicines such as cinnabar, gallstone, amber, gold, silver, brains, musk, or mercury, this could lead to chronic wind seizures, resulting in abdominal distension and cold feet, making treatment ineffective.</p>
<p>Lastly, if the spleen and stomach are not kept warm, it can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and chronic seizures.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The classics say: The spleen is the Yellow Mother, and the stomach is the Golden Father, responsible for nourishing the five organs and six bowels. If the spleen and stomach are fully solid, then fluids circulate freely, and qi and blood flow smoothly, creating harmony between the exterior and interior, resulting in overall health. The spleen and stomach belong to the earth element and are averse to dampness. </p>
<p>If children develop fever, with swollen upper lips and a hot head, or exhibit heat and agitation, and the parents are unaware, they may mistakenly treat it as a cold or food injury, employing exterior herbs to induce sweating, using purgatives to expel, or cooling herbs to calm the heart, or applying balmy decoctions to alleviate symptoms. This leads to an imbalance of heat and cold, causing internal damage to the spleen and stomach, which may affect the large intestine, resulting in greenish stools. If this persists, vomiting is inevitable, and continued vomiting can lead to convulsions. </p>
<p>Convulsions, characterized by heat, are treated with cooling herbs. However, this can further undermine the true qi, leading to a situation where recovery is increasingly difficult. The classics state: If the spleen and earth are weak, the liver and wood will dominate. Hence, muscle spasms occur, necessitating the use of herbs to tonify the spleen, warm the stomach, and smooth the qi for treatment, so that recovery may be attained.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>8. When the infant is still unsettled from crying, do not let them drink milk, as it can lead to vomiting of greenish milk and feces. When the child is in the womb, if the mother excessively takes in cool air, it will cause coldness to invade the fetus. After the child is born, if they cry in sadness and are immediately given milk, the combination of air and food can become trapped inside, leading to damage to the spleen and stomach. This may result in mild symptoms such as vomiting greenish milk and feces; in severe cases, it can lead to gurgling noises in the abdomen, reversed airflow, and excessive saliva, making it difficult to treat.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><p>Do not lightly administer calamine or cinnabar. Both mercury and calamine are toxic; although they are said to expel phlegm, their nature is cold and harmful to the heart’s energy. Cinnabar, while it can settle anxieties, is also cold and harms the spirit; it is easy to injure young children when they consume it, and many misfortunes arise from this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bathing can lead to the development of rashes. Infants within the first week should not be bathed frequently or carelessly, as their skin is delicate and their pores are not tightly closed. Bathing them may trap humid and heated air inside, leading to the emergence of rashes that appear like rouge, resulting in high body temperatures; if toxins penetrate the abdomen, it can be fatal. Additionally, bathing can cause harm that leads to cold symptoms, coughing, and respiratory distress, which often arises from this practice.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang】</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>On Infants</strong></p>
<p>Newborns should be swaddled for the first month. The method of swaddling must be appropriate. During the spring and summer months, when all things grow, they should be laid on the ground to receive the beneficial growth energy; during the autumn and winter months, when all things are stored, they should be placed in warm areas to avoid counteracting the storing energy. Only then, when the blood is consolidated and the qi is harmonized, will there be no illness entering from outside.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>Breastfeeding</p>
<p>Tang said: For infants, breastfeeding must be done properly. &quot;Milk&quot; refers to breast milk, and &quot;feeding&quot; refers to food. After breastfeeding, do not immediately offer solid food, and after feeding, do not immediately offer milk. Infants have weak spleen and stomach, and combining milk and food makes digestion difficult. After one year, this will lead to milk and food stagnation in the abdomen, causing pain and heat, and thus development of malnutrition. </p>
<p>Generally, the milk of a wet nurse is derived from her blood and energy. The emotions of joy and anger all arise from the blood and energy, so she should avoid strong emotions and all taboos. The nurse must not have conditions like foul body odor, goiter, cough, scabs, baldness, thick lips, deafness, hoarseness, nasal flaring, or epilepsy, as these may affect the infant negatively.</p>
<p>During hot summer months, after the wet nurse bathes or when the baby cries, do not offer milk, as it may lead to stomach toxins and cause dysentery in fall. After bathing, it is advisable to let the nurse rest for a long while until the heat dissipates before breastfeeding, thus avoiding problems.</p>
<p>Nie said: If the baby cries excessively, do not provide milk. This may cause disordered energy to rise, potentially leading to convulsions. </p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; says: If the baby wants more milk, one should remove the baby, knead the breast, and then offer milk again. If parents are engaged in intimacy and the child is lying to the side or wakes up in surprise, do not offer breastfeeding, as the chaotic energy may harm the baby.</p>
<p>Cao said: If the baby is crying and breath not stable, the mother should not breastfeed. This is to avoid obstructing the flow of milk, which may lead to nausea.</p>
<p>At night, the mother should sit up to hold and feed the baby.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>Every time one intends to drink milk in the morning, one must squeeze out the old milk.<br>Do not spill the milk on the ground, for insects and ants will consume it, leaving the milk devoid of substance, which can be used to nourish the good walls of the east.<br>Milk can cause the child to be ill.  </p>
<p>Pleasant milk causes drooling and wheezing.<br>Sun Zhao says: It makes the child’s breath chaotic and can induce phlegm, wheezing, or even fright.<br>Angry milk causes hernia and abdominal distension.<br>The &quot;Qianjin Yi&quot; says: Angry milk leads to hernia in children. Bian Que says: For women, it causes abdominal swelling.<br>Cold milk causes the milk to curdle.<br>Hua Tuo notes: The cold milk causes weakness and crying. The &quot;Qianjin Ji&quot; states: It causes the child to cough.<br>Hot milk causes pallor and lack of appetite.<br>The &quot;Qianjin Yi&quot; states: Hot milk causes vomiting. Zhang notes: Hot milk injures lung qi, leading to a hunched chest in children.<br>Qi milk causes vomiting and diarrhea, as well as abdominal distension.<br>The &quot;Baojian&quot; states: It results in the child having a pale yellow complexion, reduced nursing, and nighttime crying due to hunger.<br>Sick milk can lead to various illnesses.<br>It makes the child yellow, emaciated, sweaty at night, and crying from discomfort. Sun’s commentary states: Sick milk results in weakness and causes various ailments.<br>Stagnant milk causes regurgitation and phlegm.  <a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>The &quot;Ling Mi&quot; states: Congested milk turns into phlegm, which can cause fright. The &quot;Bao Jian&quot; mentions: Congested milk leads to a milk habit. Additionally, reverse flow can generate phlegm. </p>
<p>Feeding congested milk and inducing abdominal urgency can lead to internal chill. The &quot;Bao Jian&quot; also mentions that urgency and diarrhea arise, with heat in the chest and back, and nighttime crying and emaciation, akin to a stagnation lump. </p>
<p>Drunken milk can lead to confusion and excessive fright. The &quot;Qian Jin Ji&quot; states: If a child becomes hot with abdominal pain, according to Bian Que, drunken indulgence can cause confusion and excessive fright in infants. </p>
<p>Indulgent milk will surely result in fright and seizures. The &quot;Bao Jian&quot; states that a wet nurse&#39;s indulgence and emotional chaos can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, body heat, and crying like a crow—an untreated condition. </p>
<p>As for the aforementioned milk issues, they urgently affect infants and can lead to various illnesses, thus they should not be overlooked. In general, if there is emotional disturbance from joy or anger in the mother, the child will experience vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and failure to eat due to malnutrition. Accumulated cold and heat that does not disperse can cause phlegm, excess saliva, coughing, lung bloating, and a hardened chest. Drunken indulgence can lead to excessive fright and seizures in infants. </p>
<p>The &quot;Sheng Hui Fang&quot; notes that drunken breastfeeding can endanger a child. The &quot;Sheng Ji Jing&quot; discusses that milk should not be hot during summer; heat causes vomiting. In winter, it should not be cold; cold leads to diarrhea. A mother should avoid anger; anger results in upwards distress causing mania. A mother should avoid drunkenness; drunkenness leads to body heat and fullness in the abdomen. If the mother vomits or has diarrhea while breastfeeding, it can lead to weakness and emaciation; if she has accumulated heat while breastfeeding, it can turn yellow and lead to inability to eat. If breastfeeding occurs soon after marriage, the child may be weak and unable to walk. Generally, if breastfeeding or feeding is poor, it will lead to illness.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The &quot;Baojian&quot; states: At five days old, a child can be fed like a jujube pit; at a hundred days, like a bullet; feed twice daily, morning and evening. Do not bath the baby under eaves, undress in the wind, or nurse while he is still crying, as this can lead to cold exposure during feeding. Avoid being near spirits or animals, and do not touch various belongings of different families, as this might harm the child&#39;s nature and cause seizures. The classics state: Before reaching three years, do not feed chicken, as it leads to worms in the child&#39;s belly. </p>
<p>Qian Yi states: A child often suffers from excessive care. If they are still not eating well by two or three years, their spleen and stomach may become weak, leading to frequent illness. After six months, it is best to give them thin rice porridge and sometimes noodle soup. After ten months, gradually introduce thicker porridge to strengthen their energy and make them easier to raise with fewer illnesses. Avoid raw, cold, oily, and sweet foods. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Wai Tai,&quot; Cui&#39;s method for the initial feeding of children aligns with auspicious days such as the Day of the Earth or the Days of the Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, and Rooster. Boys should avoid the days of Wu and Ji; girls should avoid the days of Bing and Ding.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Weaning Method</strong></p>
<p>When a child reaches the age of four or five and is reluctant to wean, it is advisable to use eyebrow balm. After weaning, one may gradually introduce meat into their diet, which will help prevent the risk of malnutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Care Methods</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Huan said: The wet nurse should daily at three times touch the child&#39;s crown at the Fengchi point. If the child has a strong fever, one must apply compresses to induce slight sweating for recovery. It is said: &quot;Be cautious in raising children, and carefully protect the Fengchi point.&quot; The Fengchi point is located at the side of the neck where the tendons meet; treat it only when there is illness. Do not recklessly employ acupuncture or other invasive methods, nor should one induce vomiting or diarrhea, as these can harm a child&#39;s meridians and disrupt their internal organs. During summer, keep the infant in a somewhat cool place; the wet nurse should not restrict them from drinking fresh water, but it should not be excessive. If an infant shows illness in spring or summer, one must avoid indiscriminate purging, as it may lead to deficiencies in the lower body and excess heat in the upper body, resulting in severe illness. Infants should be considered differently based on their geographic origins, as the temperature of the earth varies. After two full months of life, the infant’s eyes and smiles develop, and they can recognize people. The wet nurse must not allow strangers to hold the child, nor should the child be exposed to unusual objects.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>When an infant reaches a hundred days, the Ren Meridian develops, and they can react repeatedly. The wet nurse should manage her emotions of joy and anger and adapt to the child&#39;s temperature needs. </p>
<p>At half a year, the infant’s bones have formed. The wet nurse should teach the child how to sit. </p>
<p>At two hundred days, the external bones develop. The wet nurse should teach the child to crawl on the ground. </p>
<p>At three hundred days, the kneecap has formed. The wet nurse should teach the child to stand independently. </p>
<p>At one year, the knee bones have developed. The wet nurse should teach the child to walk. </p>
<p>All the above are established principles. If a person in the world cannot adhere to these guidelines, they often hold the child too long, damaging their muscles and bones; thus, it is advisable to refrain for good fortune. </p>
<p>The Treatise on Full Health states: A farmer&#39;s wife caring for her child should have no other ailments. This is akin to grass and trees growing in deep mountains and large marshes, easily able to be embraced. As for rare fruits and unique materials, even with cultivation, there are instances where they do not bear fruit; is their value or worth really different? When exposed to wind and sun, the blood solidifies, the vitality becomes strong, and the muscles grow firm and dense, able to withstand wind and cold, resembling children raised in rural areas.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Bathe the Infant</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, on the third day, take tender branches of mulberry, elm, peach, and willow, each around three inches long, and boil them to make a medicinal bath. Check the temperature, adding two or three pieces of pig bile for the bath. The bathing solution should contain pig bile and motherwort, which prevents sores and skin diseases; gold, silver, tiger bone, musk, and cinnabar to drive away evil spirits and prevent fright and convulsions; and roots from peach, plum, cherry, and other trees to alleviate heat and strength-related ailments. This must be boiled right before bathing.</p>
<p>The bathing solution should be neither too cold nor too hot, carried out in a windless, closed room. The bath should not last too long. After bathing, apply powder to the skin, or use bright powder and clam shell powder to ward off evil and bring good fortune. </p>
<p>According to the guidelines for bathing: the days of the tiger, rabbit, and rooster are auspicious, while the days of the water horse, fire goat, and earth chicken are inauspicious. You should not bathe on the third day following birth, nor should you bathe within three days before that. For a newborn, bathe on the third, fifth, or seventh day, selecting an auspicious date.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Method for Cutting the Umbilical Cord</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Precious Mirror&quot; states: When cutting the cord, if using scissors, warm them first in your bosom. If water enters the cord, and the baby cries painfully while turning blue and black, it indicates a serious condition. If the cord wound does not dry for a long time, and external wind affects it, the mouth may become silent and the situation becomes uncontrollable.</p>
<p><strong>Moxibustion of the Umbilical Cord</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Holy Benefit&quot; states: When a child is born and has spent one night, hold them close in a bright, windless place. If you notice a red vein running straight up from the umbilical area, apply moxibustion at the end of the vein three times, and the red will dissipate without issue.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Treating Congenital Toxins</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Huan says: On the first day after birth, once the cord is cut and the clothing is finished, observe the child&#39;s complexion. If the face is rosy and appears vibrant, and the cries are loud and quick, then apply mercury powder, as it is good for relieving any remaining cord remnants. Next, use licorice; then apply red honey. Continue to observe the complexion; if it appears more pale and blue, and the cries are weak, there is no need for medication. Next, you may use buffalo horn powder. Ancient prescriptions also include methods using Coptis, non-juice treatments, pig&#39;s milk, etc. When observing the child&#39;s cold/heat and strength, choose the appropriate method to use accordingly.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>The Method of Preserving the Child&#39;s Clothing</strong></p>
<p>Cui says: The child&#39;s clothing should be washed with clear water, ensuring it is not soiled by sand, dirt, or grass; then wash it again with clear wine. Place a coin inside the clothing, put it in a new jar, wrap it in green cotton, tightly seal the jar, and keep it in a suitable place. After three days, on an auspicious day of the month, bury it in a sunlit, high, and dry area, three feet deep, with at least one foot and seven inches of soil above the jar, sealed well. This will bring longevity and wisdom. If not careful, it may become food for pigs and dogs, leading to madness; if eaten by insects or ants, it may cause illnesses or sores; if eaten by dogs or birds, it may lead to death in war. Near a community shrine, it may cause visions of ghosts; near deep or dirty water, it may lead to drowning; near an old stove, it may cause fright; near a well, it may cause deafness or blindness. Abandoning it in roads or alleys may lead to the end of descendants; placing it at a doorway may cause silence or deafness; in flowing water may lead to green blindness; in fire may cause rotten sores; in trees may lead to self-hanging. These taboos must be observed with caution. Bury it during the time of Heavenly Virtue and the Void of the month. [In the first month, Heavenly Virtue is on Ding, and Void on Bing and Ren. For further details, refer to the official calendar.] If an opposing day occurs, it is better to hang it outside the house in a place of fortune, facing the sun in a high and dry area, and wait until the month has passed before proceeding to bury it according to the rules, which is auspicious. If born on a Jia or Yi day, bury it on Bing or Ding days; if born on Bing or Ding days, bury it on Wu or Ji days; if born on Wu or Ji days, bury it on Geng or Xin days; if born on Geng or Xin days, bury it on Ren or Gui days, which is auspicious.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Head Shaving Method</strong></p>
<p>In &quot;Collected Verification Recipes,&quot; it states: For infants&#39; first head shaving, no specific date is chosen; it is done on the full moon day. This is due to customary beliefs. After childbirth, women have not yet left the room, and on the full moon, they and their child both go out. It is believed that fetal hair is impure and can disturb the spiritual fires, causing the infant to be restless; therefore, shaving the head on this day is essential. </p>
<p>When shaving the head, it should be done in a warm place, avoiding the wind. After shaving, three peeled and crushed apricot kernels should be mixed with three leaves of mint, ground together, then added with three or four drops of raw sesame oil, combined with powder, and applied on the head to ward off wind and evil spirits, preventing sores, scabs, and heat toxins. This method is also suitable for the child thereafter.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Chen)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On the Umbilicus of Newborns</strong></p>
<p>The umbilicus of a person, at the time of birth, is formed by the mingling of the father’s essence and the mother’s blood. It comes together and solidifies, with the fetal body in a state of chaos. From the undifferentiated state of Taiji, the primordial qi separates into two and six (yin and yang). Inside the womb, there are four spaces that correspond with the two kidneys externally and two vessels—one red and one white—internally. Among these four spaces, there is division between surface and interior. Inside the mother’s belly, the mother breathes in and the baby breathes out; as the mother inhales, the baby inhales as well, forming a whole through the umbilical cord, just as flowers and fruits are connected through their stems.</p>
<p>One month after birth, the true qi gradually becomes sufficient. Once the placenta has been delivered, the umbilical cord is slowly cut. If the umbilical opening has not closed, exposure to wind or cold may harm the baby&#39;s true qi. Therefore, it is advisable to use mugwort to fumigate and steam multiple times, ensuring the true qi is protected. When a newborn is first handled, use cotton to wrap the umbilical cord, two to three inches away from the belly, securing it with cotton and then cutting the umbilical cord with thread outside the secured area; wait a moment for the blood to flow out completely. </p>
<p>Upon examining the area close to the belly, the umbilicus has two small holes and one large hole. Use a goose feather tube to introduce a small amount of umbilical medicine into the large hole, gently massaging it with a fingertip. Perform moxibustion on the umbilicus three times, then bind it with a soft cloth, ensuring it is not frequently uncovered. Allow the umbilicus to fall naturally, as this will prevent exposure to wind.</p>
<p>Additionally, when the placenta is expelled, if the umbilicus is soft, there is no need for treatment. However, if the umbilicus is hard and straight, it indicates umbilical wind. Quickly use a silver hairpin to prick one or two places near the umbilical root, then apply a small amount of musk and perform moxibustion three times, which is highly effective.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p>
<h3>Concealing the Afterbirth</h3>
<p>The afterbirth of a newborn should be buried in auspicious directions. It is best to do this in the first month during the proper timing: during the second month (Chou), the third month (Yin), the fourth month (Mao), the fifth month (Chen), the sixth month (Si), the seventh month (Wu), the eighth month (Wei), the ninth month (Shen), the tenth month (You), the eleventh month (Xu), and the twelfth month (Hai). If the auspicious direction is inconvenient, it should be buried according to the calendar in the direction of the Doctor of Writing on the moon’s virtue, avoiding directions ruled by emptiness, three killings, and the Grand Duke. It is improper to place it in the river.</p>
<h3>Nurturing and Care</h3>
<p>Raising a child requires careful nurturing; attention is necessary, and one must not be lax. Too much milk will damage the stomach, while obstructive foods will harm the spleen. Too thick clothing does not benefit; appropriate clothing should be light. Avoid wind and seek sunlight; maintain harmony with the seasons. In the first three to five months after birth, the infant should be swaddled and laid down, and should not be held upright to avoid startling fits. Only after six months can one offer thin porridge, avoiding mixing with milk to prevent sores. Meat may be introduced only after the age of five.</p>
<h3>Restoration of Health</h3>
<p>Upon birth, it is advisable to dress the newborn in old skirts and coats from elderly individuals aged seventy or eighty, transformed into baby clothes, as this helps nurture the vital energy and grants longevity. In wealthy families, it is crucial not to dress the child in new silk or brocade, as this could not only lead to illness but also diminish fortune, potentially resulting in untimely death.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>On Bathing Infants</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, it is essential to bathe them first, to cleanse away impurities, and then the umbilical cord can be severed. If the cord is cut first, the bathwater may enter the navel, leading to conditions like navel sores. The bathing water must be prepared with medicinal herbs beforehand, stored in a bottle, and warmed up as needed, avoiding fresh water for the best results. Additionally, for subsequent baths, medicinal decoctions should also be used, choosing appropriate days and times, which is very beneficial. Generally, bathing should occur within the first hundred days during the hours of the Tiger and Rabbit. If the infant&#39;s first few days do not fall on these times, bathing can still be done at midday during three specific hours. It is crucial to avoid the days and times of Ren Wu, Ding Si, and Gui Si as they are greatly inauspicious. All other times are acceptable.</p>
<p>Using a pig bile broth for bathing infants prevents sores and skin conditions, making their skin smooth and moist. A decoction of gold, silver, tiger bone, and cinnabar repels evil spirits and calms fears; using only tiger bone is also sufficient. A mixture of half a pound of sliced plum leaves helps to disperse muscular heat and alleviate excess warmth. A decoction made of two taels of Bai Zhi and three taels of Ku Shen, crushed and boiled, can dispel all kinds of wind ailments.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>Use raw rice chaff, green onions, sesame leaves, angelica, dry roots, and chenopodium to brew a decoction to reduce fever. Use苦参 (ku shen),黄连 (huang lian), pig bile, white atractylodes, cypress leaves, cedar leaves, and maple leaves to brew a decoction to dispel wind. Use hemp seeds, ligusticum, cloves, mulberries, and dry roots to brew a decoction to treat various sores. Use gold, silver, peach branches, realgar, and cinnabar to brew a decoction to exorcise evil and dispel fright. Use motherwort to brew a decoction to treat scabies and other sores. </p>
<p>For each decoction, use one dou (approximately 10 liters) of water, boil the herbs until reduced to seven sheng (approximately 1.5 liters), strain out the dregs, and apply according to cold or warm conditions. In winter, do not make it too hot; in summer, do not let it be too cold; it must be adjusted properly before use. </p>
<p>After childbirth, a child must be bathed regularly to remove dirt, but not excessively. If bathing is neglected, the skin will become rough, hair will fall out, and sores or scabies may develop. During bathing, use a little water on the back and allow more on other areas. Do not overly soak the back, nor let the child sit in water for too long, as it may induce fright and illness; care must be taken! If these methods are properly followed, the child will have a smooth and comfortable body, good circulation, and be less prone to illness as they grow up, with evident results.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Cutting the Umbilical Cord</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, the umbilical cord must be cut at the proper time. If it is not cut in time, the cord juice remains, leading to coldness, which causes umbilical wind. The cord should be cut to a length that reaches the ankle, or about six inches. If it is too short, it can harm the organs, causing imbalance in the child&#39;s abdomen; if too long, it can harm the flesh, causing the child&#39;s skin to become dry and scaly. Immediately after cutting the cord, one must use a cord moxibustion cake, placing it over the cord stump and burning it three times, with each treatment about the size of a grain of wheat. If the child has not cried, apply moxibustion five to seven times. After the moxibustion, one should seal the cord stump with a cord seal powder. The fabric used should be beaten to make it soft, about four inches square, with a layer of new cotton half an inch thick placed on top, and medication powder sprinkled on, properly tightening and sealing it. If the necessary medicine is not on hand, a finely ground piece of cooked mugwort may also be used for sealing. However, the cloth should not be sealed too tightly, as this may cause the child to vomit. Additionally, constant care is required to ensure it does not get wet or contact the swaddling cloth, and the child’s urine must not wet it, as this could lead to sores, swelling, or attract wind.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>The &quot;Sengji Jing&quot; states: When a child is born and has not absorbed the unhealthy blood, it should be wiped with cotton and if it is swallowed and remains in the chest, induce vomiting. Use licorice for this purpose. If it has entered the abdomen, use a powder of Coptis to induce a purge. These are all methods to cleanse impurities. Next, take about a bean-sized quantity of good vermilion, finely ground and dissolved in water, and mixed with honey from a clam shell, adjusting the thickness to form a paste. Divide this into three doses, administering one dose at a time by mixing it with breast milk and dropping it into the child&#39;s mouth. Complete the doses within three days. Yao He and others say that prepared vermilion can warm the intestines and stomach, and invigorate blood and qi. Only one bean-sized dose is allowed per day, divided into three times; do not exceed this. Then use genuine ox gall, about the size of a bean, finely ground and prepared with honey to the size of a sour jujube, forming a paste. Each time, use a large bean-sized amount, dissolved in breast milk and dropped into the child’s mouth. Yao He and others say it can dispel fright and eliminate malevolent energy. However, if the child&#39;s appearance is weak or frail, it should not be administered. If the child shows signs of heat or has a red or yellow complexion, it should be taken more frequently. This method is applicable for a duration of three days.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>On Cautious Nurturing</strong></p>
<p>When a wet nurse carefully nurtures a child, she should breastfeed with moderation, wrap the child appropriately, ensure the child’s hunger and fullness are addressed, observe the child’s strength and weakness, adjust the thickness of nourishment, and respond to temperature changes. These practices are based on established principles that should not be overlooked. From birth until a month old, it is customary to administer a few drops of pig&#39;s milk into the infant&#39;s mouth. Additionally, take a large soybean&#39;s worth of powdered pearl, mix it with honey from a clam shell, and apply it to the child’s mouth in three or four doses, once every ten days or so. This calms the mind and stabilizes the spirit. During spring, infants should not have their heads and feet covered, as this would prevent the release of yang energy, leading to fever.</p>
<p><strong>On Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>There are certain foods that are unsuitable for young children; it is essential to be aware of these. Children should not eat too many chestnuts, as this weakens their qi and slows their movements; heated foods can cause qi stagnation. Children should not consume bracken fern, as it weakens their legs and prevents them from walking. They should not eat spiny water lily, as this hinders locomotion. Children should avoid millet, chicken, and cucumbers, as these can cause intestinal parasites. They should not eat pitcher plants, as this can lead to chronic ailments. Buckwheat should also be avoided, as it can cause hair loss. Children should not eat cocklebur, as it can result in pain during excretion. Lastly, they should not consume sturgeon, as this can induce disorders and obsessions.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>Children should not eat fried beans and pork, as it can cause anger and lead to death. </p>
<p>In general, children should not eat excessively. If there is a heart ailment, they should avoid salty foods. If there is a lung condition, they should steer clear of bitter foods. If there is a liver issue, spicy foods should be avoided. If the spleen is unwell, sour and spoiled foods should be excluded. If there is kidney trouble, sweet drinks are to be avoided. Green onions and honey, when consumed together, are harmful. Amaranth and turtle meat, together, produce toxins. Oily fish and shrimp are to be avoided in the case of lung diseases. Raw cold eggs should not be eaten if there are spleen issues. Fried chicken and lamb are not suitable for heart ailments. Green onions, garlic, and oily noodles must be avoided for liver diseases. Kidneys, stomachs, and lung parts, regardless of whether one is ill or not, should not be eaten. Birds and sparrows can cause sores and scabs when consumed. Snails and crabs can lead to severe digestive issues. Eating sweet food leads to illness, and eating too much can exhaust energy. Cold food can cause stagnation, and sour food can damage willpower. Bitter food can drain energy, and salty food can cause difficulty in breathing. Fatty food generates phlegm, and spicy food harms the lungs. Lotus seeds and water caltrops can help invigorate heart energy; pomegranates and sour oranges can greatly harm the intestines and stomach. Dried persimmons boiled with sugar can still benefit the lungs. Steamed lotus root and fried beans are good for the liver. Five-flavor jujubes can please the spleen. A bland diet is beneficial for the organs and promotes clear energy. Parents who love and cherish their children must be aware of these prohibitions. If overlooked, diseases can arise innocently. Once healing is needed, it may be too late for regrets. Families raising children should pay attention!<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>The Complete Book of Jingyue</strong> (Ming Dynasty, Zhang Jieben)</p>
<p><strong>On the Birth of Infants</strong></p>
<p>When an infant is born, one should take a small amount of finely chopped licorice and steep it in boiling water to make a mild solution, not too sweet. Use soft cloth to dab the solution, cleaning the mouth to remove impurities. Next, take walnut meat, peel it, and chew it thoroughly; then wrap it in thin silk or gauze, forming it like a small date, and place it in the infant&#39;s mouth so that it can suck the juice. This not only harmonizes the stomach but also nourishes the organs—it is the best method. If the mother has a cold constitution and the infant is weak and clear, simply use a mild ginger tea to clean the mouth, which is most effective for removing stomach cold, clarifying the mind, and can also prevent vomiting and diarrhea. This method is excellent and not widely known. After cleaning, follow the walnut method as mentioned earlier. </p>
<p>Another method: take half a portion of cow bile, mix it with cinnabar, and adjust it with honey as before for sucking.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>It is extremely effective in dispersing phlegm, eliminating filth and evil, and calming the spirit. However, it should only be used when the child has excessive heat from maternal qi; it is not suitable for those who are weak and feeble. </p>
<p>In ancient practices, there was much use of Huanglian, but it is important to note that Huanglian is extremely cold and bitter, and since young children have their primary energy in the stomach, how can they be expected to withstand the detrimental effects of such bitterness immediately after birth? This could damage their stomach qi, leading to vomiting or diarrhea in the future, which is certainly not advisable.</p>
<p>Another ancient method often employed was grinding cinnabar to open the mouth. In medical texts, it is noted that newborns should take cinnabar, light powder, white honey, and Huanglian to clear fetal toxins; however, these are all substances that harm the spleen and damage yang. The light powder causes phlegm that weakens the heart, and cinnabar damages the spirit by lowering saliva. Strong children may process these substances too easily, while weak ones are easily harmed, resulting in various diseases. Therefore, careful consideration is crucial.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br><strong>Protection Law</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Good Formula&quot; states: At night, do not let the child rest on an arm. One should make one or two bean bags for the child to rest upon, placing them on either side, close to the wet nurse. The clothes and blankets should cover the child, with the head and face exposed. If the child continuously lies on their back, they may be at risk of developing a startle reflex; therefore, they should be turned regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Formula</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gentle Drink for Children</strong> (from the &quot;Crane&#39;s Head Classic&quot;): In the first few days after birth, a drink should be given. &quot;Finger Guide&quot; states: On the third day after birth, the mother should take it. Ingredients: Ginseng, Poria, Licorice, and Cimicifuga, each 2.5 grams, with one cup of water, boil down to 1.5 cups, and give it to the child from time to time. The wet nurse should avoid oily foods for a month after childbirth and during the hundred days. If it is cold, add half a portion of Atractylodes; if it is hot, add half a portion of Niter.</p>

Chao&#39;s notes state: Undigested food is due to a cold spleen and stomach. When infants are breastfed and consume excessively cold and raw foods, cold energy accumulates in the spleen and stomach.

<p>Grind to a very fine powder, mix with a little raw sesame oil and light powder, and apply generously to the eyebrows when the child is asleep. Upon waking, they will not seek breast milk. If it does not work, add one qian of huang dan (yellow lead).<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>Navel Powder</strong></p>
<p>Ingredients: Clean ash from steamer, ash from unkempt hair, ash from white ginger, and ash from red silk, all in equal parts; South Star, White Lin, Angelica root (head), red beans, gallnut, blood-resin, dragon bone, burnt red stone resin, sea eagle, and herbal frost, each half a coin. Grind all to an extremely fine powder. For wet application, use it as a paste; for dry application, apply with clear oil. Avoid using raw water on the navel.</p>
<p>Another Formula: Ash from red cotton, ash from yellow cow dung, burnt dragon bone ground, ash from unkempt hair, and dry rouge, each half a coin. Grind into an extremely fine powder. For wet application, mix; for dry application, lubricate the navel with clear oil.</p>
<p>The Best Method for Preserving Life: This formula not only detoxifies but also nourishes. The navel is the source of life, related to the mother’s gate and the two kidneys’ dominion. By nourishing the kidneys, they become sufficient, thus preventing any interference. Thereby, no darkening of the navel occurs, nor are there any diseases related to disconnection.</p>
<p>Once the baby’s umbilical cord falls off, dry it on a new tile, and grind to powder with cinnabar, yellow baneberry, and licorice, each five parts. Mix and blend with honey, apply three to five times to the nursing mother’s milk. Wait for the baby to ingest it all within a day and night; subsequently, toxins will be expelled through bowel movements. In the future, not only will smallpox be less frequent, but there may be those who do not develop it at all. Wait until the umbilical cord falls off, and perform this procedure perfectly within six to seven days. The cinnabar must be ground into an extremely fine powder and passed through licorice soup. Safe for consumption without harm.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>The First Recipe for Longevity</strong><br>In &quot;A Cure for All Diseases,&quot; this method is to be used for newborns, ensuring they never suffer from sores, rashes, or any illnesses throughout their lives. For every child born, one will benefit from this superb method. When the newborn’s umbilical cord falls off, place it on a new tile, surrounding it with charcoal fire until the smoke is nearly gone. Then, set it down, covering it with a tile, allowing it to retain its essence, and grind it into a fine powder. Use cinnabar that is transparent and prepare it into an extremely fine powder, passing it through water. </p>
<p>For the two ingredients mentioned, if the umbilical cord weighs five fen, use two fen and five li of cinnabar, along with a concentrated decoction of raw Rehmannia and Angelica. Mix these with a few shellfish, stir together the first two ingredients, and apply it to the child’s palate and the breastfeeding mother’s nipple, ensuring it is fully administered within one day until evening. The next day, there will be a bowel movement that expels impure wastes, thereby eliminating fetal toxins and ensuring no sores or rashes will occur. </p>
<p>These two formulas, as well as the detoxifying longevity ointment, share the common ingredient of the umbilical cord, but the preparation and accompanying medicinal ingredients vary in weight and importance.

<li><strong>Cloves (0.3 tael)</strong>: They enter the lungs to nourish blood and bolster the spleen and stomach.</li>
<li><strong>Night Bright Sand (0.5 tael)</strong>: It can penetrate the lungs, replenish insufficient qi, and disperse excess internal injuries.</li>
<li><strong>Frankincense and Wood Fragrance powder (2 buckwheat)</strong>: Each can aid in digestion.</li>
<li><strong>Fennel (0.4 tael)</strong>: It can treat dampness and help regulate circulation, elevating and descending qi to prevent wheezing and coughing.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>If you wish to stop the flow of water, first seek its source: myrrh, tiger bone, black snake bone, dragon bone, and pearl powder, each five qian; realgar three qian, able to eliminate the root of disease and support the weak while enhancing the strong.

</ul>
<p>The above is made into a powder; for newborns when the umbilical cord is cut, use one or two fen and insert it into the large hole near the abdomen, gently kneading it with your hand to prevent umbilical wind. For adults, use a strip of white flour around the navel; take a portion of the previously mentioned medicine, divide it into three parts; first fill the umbilical cavity with musk powder; then take another part of the medicine and place it in the flour circle, pressing the medicine tightly and puncturing several holes; externally, apply a piece of locust tree bark over the medicine, which can seal in the essence of various gases to prevent them from escaping; then use moxibustion on it to harness its heat, expel disease and toxins, and restore life. </p>
<p>Moxibustion should be done five to sixty or even up to one hundred and twenty times. If done once each season throughout the year, all ailments will be eradicated, benefiting and prolonging life. For women, omit the musk and add one qian of fragrant brain. During moxibustion, sweating profusely is expected; be cautious of wind and cold and avoid greasy and cold foods, maintaining a good regimen for a month.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>Laoqi Bingzi (Belly Button Cake) [From &quot;Baoyou Dazuan&quot;, same as below] When a newborn&#39;s umbilical cord is cut, use this to secure the cord and apply moxibustion. </p>

<p><strong>Single Formula</strong>  </p>
<p>When a child is first born, it is advisable to give them fresh Rehmannia juice, a drop on the child’s mouth, which will induce black stools. They will not suffer from ulcers or rashes in adulthood. 【Zhongjing’s Formula】<br><strong>Licorice Method</strong>: Use a good piece of licorice about the length of a finger, crush it, and boil it with the water from two clam shells; steep one clam shell. Use cotton to soak it and allow the child to suck on it; it’s best if they spit out the bad juice. If they consume one clam shell and do not spit, they do not need to take more. This is necessary for infants regardless of their constitution or whether they are cold or hot. 【From the &#39;Elbow Back Formula&#39;】<br><strong>Huanglian Method</strong>: For a newborn, if the bad juice remains in the chest and is obstructed, it can easily lead to heat accumulation and convulsions. Use several good blocks of fatty Huanglian (Coptis), crush them and wrap them in cotton to form a size about that of a nipple. Soak it in water to extract yellow juice, take one or two drops, and place it in the child’s mouth; the bad juice will naturally flow out, and their breastfeeding will improve. Any remaining should be soaked in cotton separately, and later give it with red honey intermittently. 【From the &#39;Collection of Verified Formulas&#39;】<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>To prepare, take one qian of pure Huanglian and a cup of water, boil them beforehand. When the child is born and hasn&#39;t cried yet, administer this to expel the harmful substances such as excess waste and to relieve accumulated heat and poison from the fetus. This will prevent lifelong complications like sores and conditions related to the navel wind. </p>
<p>For newborns, to expel fetal toxins, chew on sesame fat and use a cotton bag to administer it to the child. The toxins will pass naturally.</p>
<p>Using leek juice: After licorice, soak leek seeds in warm water and apply the juice to the child’s lips. Reapply several times until it dries, but do not allow it to be ingested.</p>
<p>Using ox gall: Take a piece of genuine ox gall, blend it with honey to form an ointment, and administer a bean-sized amount, allowing it to dissolve in milk and drip into the child&#39;s mouth. If the appearance is not satisfactory, avoid excessive use. For infants with high fetal heat or yellowish skin, it is advisable to administer more of this. </p>
<p>If the child is born with a red complexion and cries loudly, use half a qian of mercury powder and let the child suck on it; if it takes a while and there’s navel waste, that is a good sign.</p>
<p>Immediately after birth, administering leek root juice will cause the child to expel harmful fluids.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br><strong>Zhu Mi Method</strong>: Take a good amount of vermilion about the size of a large bean, finely grind it with water to make a flying powder, then refine red honey the size of a clam shell. Adjust the consistency to form a paste. Use a piece the size of a bean, dissolve in milk, and drop it into the mouth occasionally. Stop after three doses within three days. Observe the child&#39;s complexion; if it appears mostly pale and blue, and there’s no sound of crying, then no medication is needed. </p>
<p><strong>Medical Case</strong>: </p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue,&quot; it is noted: My younger child was born in the Ding-si year, at the Yan estate, around the time of the White Dew festival, just over half a cycle of the moon. I noticed the new cool days ahead, and worried that the thin bedding might expose the child to cold air, sternly advising the caretakers to keep the child warm, but they did not take it seriously. A few days later, the child indeed began to have severe vomiting and diarrhea. I first used warming and spleen-harmonizing medicines, but to no avail. I then tried regulating formulas, yet they also did not work. After three days, I added three qian of ginseng, along with ginger, cassia, wuzhu, and nutmeg, still without effect. By the fourth day, the child was vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously, expelling half of what was consumed, with nothing retained in the belly. I had no choice but to use five or six qian of ginseng, along with one or two qian of aconite, ginger, cassia, etc. But even upon swallowing, the child would immediately vomit, leaving not a drop behind, and the milk expelled was clean and untainted, resembling milk still. At that time, the signs of danger in the child&#39;s condition were exceedingly grave, with no chance of recovery left.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>I sat quietly, reflecting on the cause of the issue, considering that the cold energy was affecting the stomach, leading to endless vomiting and diarrhea. If I were to abandon herbs like ginseng, ginger, cinnamon, and aconite, what other methods could there be? The situation became dire. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I had a thought: the stomach&#39;s deficiency had reached its limit, and if the medicine’s flavor was even slightly incompatible, the stomach would reject it. Moreover, since aconite has a salty flavor, it can also induce vomiting; this must be a contributing factor. </p>
<p>So I assessed the flavors and determined it was necessary to use a sweet and spicy remedy, as this would likely soothe the stomach energy and maintain vitality. I decided to use three qian of pepper, crushed, along with one liang of ginger, boiled in two zhongs of water until reduced by a third, and set aside for use. I also took two liang of ginseng, boiled in another two zhongs of water until reduced to one zhong, and set that aside as well. </p>
<p>With these two components, I aimed for a balanced flavor profile that was sweet and spicy. I combined the two, adjusting their taste with a teaspoon. For every ten doses of ginseng broth, I added one dose of the pepper and ginger broth, creating a mildly sweet and spicy flavor that was truly palatable.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>He then put it in warm soup, gradually spooning it to him, and slowly progressed. After a while, he swallowed it without spitting it out, and it turned out to be effective. From then on, the milk medicine was fine, but the diarrhea had still not stopped. From the fourth watch after taking it until noon, he had consumed two taels of ginseng. After the ginseng was finished, he suddenly became restless and moaned intensely. The family members complained, saying that with such tender bowels as a baby, how could he endure such hot medicine? It would definitely burn his intestines. They all wept together. Although I doubted, I did not panic, but still focused and thought deeply, considering that from the fourth watch until now, if the medicine was difficult to endure, why was he fine before noon and suddenly changed like this? It must be that after several days without food, his stomach was freshly restored, and with an empty belly, he would feel quite hungry. Nearby, there was some prepared porridge, and when I offered it to him, he became anxious and eagerly wanted it. He quickly gulped it down and looked for more. So I gave him a small bowl, and he devoured it like a whale swallowing and a tiger biting. Still not satisfied, I gave him half a bowl, yet it was still insufficient; so I gave him another half bowl, and then he quietly settled down to sleep.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>The next day, I added more prescriptions, and only then did he begin to improve and fully recover. Alas! The rebirth of this child is indeed due to fate, but when considering the causes, it is evident that the internal heat of a person&#39;s organs is linked to the back. When the mattress is thin and the nights are cold, the chill enters through the back, deeply affecting the internal organs. The treatment method, although the medication is appropriate, lacks the proper essence and flavor to integrate; thus, seeking relief becomes difficult. </p>
<p>Additionally, when hunger causes restlessness, if the spirit does not recognize its condition, and one carelessly uses cooling remedies to resolve it, then all efforts may be in vain, causing further harm! Therefore, I write this to highlight the severity of the illness, the relationship of essences and flavors, and the dynamic nature of diagnosis and treatment. Although this is specific to my own child, it underscores the confidence in healing. </p>
<p>If another’s child suffers similarly and the prescribed treatments do not yield results, one might assume the medicine is misapplied and hastily criticize the treatment, switching to harsh, cold remedies, which could be fatal. Yet the blame would still fall on the use of ginseng. At such a time, how can one distinguish right from wrong? Thus, I elaborate on these details to broaden people&#39;s understanding and awareness.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　小儿始生，肌肤未实，不可暖衣，止当薄衣，但令背暖。薄衣之法，当从秋习之，不可以春夏卒减其衣，否则令中风寒。所以从秋习之者，以渐稍寒。如此则必耐寒。冬月但着两薄襦可耐寒，若不忍见其寒，当略加耳。若爱而暖之，适所以害之也。又当消息，无令出汗。如汗出则表虚，风邪易入也。昼夜寤寐。常当慎之。其哺乳之法，亦当有节，不可过饱。或宿滞不化，当用消乳丸化积温脾等剂治之。陈氏所谓：忍三分寒，吃七分饱，频揉肚，少洗澡，及要背暖肚暖足暖，要头凉心胸凉，亦至论也。<a id="orig-30p" href="#trans-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>　　　　医学正传 【明　虞抟】</p>

<p>　　小儿受患，其为母者，胎前既不能谨节，胎后又不能调护，是以惟务姑息，不能防微杜渐。或未满百晬而遂与酸咸之味，或未彀周岁而辄与肥甘之物，百病由是而生焉。曰吐泻、曰黄疸、曰五疳、曰腹胀、曰水肿、曰疟、曰痢、曰痰喘，岂非吃食过伤，调善失宜之所致欤？<br>　　　　保婴金镜录 【明　薛己】</p>
<p>　　　　　论初生用药</p>
<p>　　愚谓凡小儿在月内外者，调补之剂，每服亦不过二三匙。若表散攻伐之药，则每服只可匙许而已，过多则反伤元气。余当量大小虚宜加减。若乳母之疾，致儿为患，当治母为主，子少服之。后仿此。<br>　　　　保婴撮要 【明　薛铠】<a id="orig-31p" href="#trans-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p>
<p>　　　　　初诞法</p>
<p>　　小儿分娩之时，口含血块，须急于未啼时，用软帛裹指，穵去其血，用黄连、豆豉、朱、蜜、甘草解之。但黄连性寒，若禀母气膏粱积热者，宜服；若滋味淡薄胎气元弱者，又不宜用。其朱砂固能解毒，恐金石镇坠，不若只以牛黄分许，蜜调与吮为佳。世多用犀角解毒丸，其胎气虚寒虚弱者，反伤脾胃生气，甚至不育。又有婴儿因其难产，或冒风寒而垂危者，切不可便断脐带，急烘绵絮，包抱怀中，急以胎衣置火中煨烧，更以火纸捻于脐带上往来燎之，使暖气入腹，须臾气复自苏。尤戒洗浴，恐脉理不密，元气发泄，而外邪乘之也。<br>　　　　　护养法</p>
<p>　　小儿初生，须令乳母预慎七情六淫，厚味炙煿，则乳汁清宁，儿不致疾。否则阴阳偏胜，血气沸腾，乳汁败坏，必生诸证。若屡用药饵，则脏腑阴损，多变败证，可不慎欤。大抵保婴之法，未病则调治乳母，既病则审治婴儿，亦必兼治其母为善。<a id="orig-32p" href="#trans-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>　　　　医学纲目 【明、楼英】</p>

<p>　　　　　婴幼论</p>
<p>　　王隐君曰：凡婴儿六十日后，瞳人将成，而能应和人情。自此为有识之初，便当诱其正性，父母尊长，渐次令其别之。僮仆婢妾，不可训其手舞足蹈，无礼骂人，高举放倒，猛推闪避，儿虽强笑，失色惊骇，乖张恶性，自此无端。乳母纵嗜厚味纯醪煎煿，儿亦受之于乳，是以惊疳积癖泻痢由之而生。及其临病，又忌灌以苦辛之药味。姑息隐忍，无所不至。大抵爱子之偏，无出于母，所嗜之食，任其饱足，以致所伤。余幼时酷嗜甘饴，忽于一日甘饴中有蚯蚓引头而出，自此不敢食饴。至长始知长上为之。不然，脾疳久患，深染难调，奈何不为戕害。<a id="orig-33p" href="#trans-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>　　　　　护养</p>
<p>　　《千金》论曰：小儿二百四十日掌骨成，母当教以匍匐。一周满，母当扶以行步。此皆则法。若或暖衣重围，不见风日，不着地气，致令筋骨软弱，数岁不能行者有之。今观田舍小儿则反是，所以见风日得土气，筋力常健，岂贵贱之理有异哉。明乎此，则保婴之道得矣。<br>　　　　　乳哺</p>
<p>　　乳哺之法，不可不慎。小儿脾胃怯弱，乳食易伤。初得作呕泻，久则成积癖。乳母饮食，乳汁便通；儿食其乳，所感立应。母食热则乳热，母食寒则乳寒。夏食热乳则致吐逆，冬食寒乳则致嗽利。母不欲怒，怒则气上为狂；母不欲醉，醉则身热腹痛。怀孕乳儿，致令黄瘦，腹大脚软，名曰鬾病。大都乳哺不可太过。谚云：小儿常病伤于饱也。又曰：忍三分饥，吃七分饱。亦至论也。<a id="orig-34p" href="#trans-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>　　　　　除胎毒</p>
<p>　　方书皆云：小儿一出腹，啼声未发之时，急用绵裹指，拭去口内恶汁，固是良法，而仓卒之际，或有不及者，故有黄连、甘草、朱、蜜等法用之殊佳。东垣云：只须淡豆豉一味煎汤，与三五口，其毒自下，又能助胃气也，尤妙。<br>　　　　　初生总论</p>
<p>　　初生小儿，必忌外客所触，古人一岁之内忌之者，并无客忤之患。小儿略识人物，不宜携至神庙，观望神像闪烁，恐生恐惧。　　小儿将入夏时，用色帛缝囊盛去皮尖杏仁七个，与小儿随身佩之，闻雷自然不惊。<br>　　　　　猪乳法</p>
<p>　　张焕论云：初生时或未有奶子，产妇之乳未下，可用猪乳代之，可免惊癎痘疮。　　钱氏曰：初生小儿至满月内，可常取猪乳滴口中最佳。按《圣惠方》取猪乳，须令猪儿饮母，次便提猪母后脚起，猪儿口自离乳，急用手捋之，即得乳矣，非此法不可取也。<a id="orig-35p" href="#trans-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>　　　　　沐浴法</p>
<p>　　小儿洗浴，不可先断脐带，候洗了方断，不致水湿伤脐，可免脐风脐疮等证。用清油调发灰傅脐。洗儿不可用水打湿脐带。<br>　　　　　断脐法</p>
<p>　　大抵儿初生断脐之后，宜用熟艾厚裹爱护。若乳母不谨，或因洗浴水入脐中，或遗尿在裙抱之内，湿气伤于脐中，或因解脱为风冷邪气所侵，皆能令儿脐肿多啼，不能乳哺，即成脐风也。<br>　　　　　着衣法</p>
<p>　　《圣惠》论曰：小儿一期之内造衣服，皆须用故帛为之，不可用新绵。若用新绵，则令儿壮热，或作惊癎。<br>　　　　　晒衣法</p>
<p>　　大抵儿衣日晒夜收，不可露天过夜，次早与儿穿上，致染湿热，使儿不安。此则所谓八邪之害，久则令儿黄瘦腹痛，身上壮热，夜间啼哭，或生疮疥。世俗谓之无辜疾，谓其衣在露天过夜，染着无辜鸟屎，令儿致疾，故曰无辜疾，其实非理。先哲所谓八邪之害，则温热风寒惊积饥饱是也。<a id="orig-36p" href="#trans-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>　　　　　养子日用法</p>

<p>　　儿才生下，须先洗浴，以荡涤污秽，然后可断脐也。若先断脐，则浴水入脐而为脐疮等病。及浴水须用药预先煎下，以瓶贮顿，临时旋暖用之，不犯生水，方佳。并已后浴之，亦用药煎汤，拣所宜时日，则大良矣。凡浴宜用寅卯百日。若初生不值，但于日中选此三时，如时亦不值，惟忌壬午丁巳癸巳日时大凶而与避之，余皆可也。　　用猪胆汁汤浴儿，则不患疮癣，皮肤滑泽。用金、银、虎骨、丹砂煎汤，则辟邪恶去惊；单用虎骨亦得。用李叶切半斤前汤，则解肌热，去温壮。用白芷二两、苦参三两挫碎煎汤，则去诸风。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>用朔藋、葱白、胡麻叶、白芷、槁本、蛇床子煎汤，退热。用苦参、黄连、猪胆、白芨、杉叶、柏叶、枫叶煎汤，去风。用大麻仁、零陵香、丁香、桑葚、藁本煎汤，治诸疮。用金、银，桃奴、雄黄、丹砂煎汤，则辟邪除惊。用益母草煎汤，治疥疮诸疮。　　凡煎汤每用水一斗，入药煎至七升，去滓，通寒温用之。冬不可太热，夏不可令冷，须调停得宜，乃可用之。儿自生之后，须依时洗浴，以去垢污，又不可数数。若都不洗浴，则皮皴毛落，多生疮疥。凡洗浴时，于背上则微微少用水，余处任意。既不可极淋其背，亦不可久坐水中，则引惊作病，切须慎之！如常能依法用之，令儿体滑舒畅，血脉通流，及长少病，无不验也。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>　　　　　断脐论</p>
<p>　　儿生下，须当以时断脐。若不以时断脐者，则令脐汁不干而生寒，为脐风之由。其断脐带当令长至足趺，或云当长六寸。若太短则伤脏，令儿腹中不调；若太长则伤肌，令儿皮枯鳞起。才断脐讫，须用烙脐饼子，安脐带上，烧三壮，炷如麦大，若儿未啼，灸至五七壮。灸了，上用封脐散封裹之。法须捶治帛子令柔软，用方四寸许，上置新绵厚半寸，及上置药末，适紧慢以封之。如不备其药，即用极细熟艾一块，置于上封之。但不令封帛紧急，急则令儿吐哯。又须常切照顾，勿令湿着及襁绷中，亦不可令儿尿湿，恐生疮肿及引风也。<a id="orig-56p" href="#trans-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>　　《圣济经》云：凡儿初生恶血未纳者，拭以绵指；吞而在胷膈者吐。以甘草；入而在腹内者利，以黄连末粉。皆所以革污秽也。次用好朱砂一大豆许，细研水飞，炼蜜一蚬壳，看稀稠和膏，分三剂，每用一剂，乳汁化，时时滴儿口中，三日内服尽即止。姚和众云：成炼朱砂能温肠胃，壮血气也。一日只可一豆许，分三次用，勿得过也。次用真牛黄一大豆许，细研，以炼蜜酸枣大，和成膏，每用一大豆许，乳汁化下，时时滴儿口中。姚和众云：能去惊，辟邪恶之气。若儿形色不实，怯弱者，不宜服之。如胎热或体色赤黄者，宜多服。此法在三日外也。<a id="orig-57p" href="#trans-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>　　　　　慎护论</p>

<p>When a child is born, first wrap their fingers with cotton and wipe the bad blood and dark phlegm from the mouth and tongue; this is referred to as &quot;Jade Scale.&quot; If this is not done quickly, as soon as the child cries, various illnesses will enter the abdomen. </p>
<p>Once the child is born, they should be lifted immediately. If there is a delay, it can cause internal cold and rumbling in the belly. First, bathe the child, then cut the umbilical cord. The cord should not be cut with a knife; instead, someone should bite through it while wearing a thin piece of clothing, and warm air should be blown on it seven times. After that, wrap the remaining umbilical cord and ensure it reaches just above the child&#39;s feet; if it is too short, it can cause internal cold and lead to an imbalance in the child&#39;s stomach, often resulting in diarrhea. </p>
<p>If the cord is cut first and then the child is bathed, water remaining in the cord can cause abdominal pain.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the navel is fully cut, if there are many worms in the umbilical cord, it is essential to quickly remove them, or else they will enter the child&#39;s abdomen and cause illness. The umbilical cord cut for a child should be about six inches long. If it&#39;s too long, it will injure the flesh; if too short, it will injure the organs. If not cut at the proper time, and if the juice of the cord is not completely drained, the warmth will gradually diminish, leading to a natural coldness that causes umbilical wind in the child.</p>
<p>For a boy, it is advisable to wrap him in his father&#39;s old clothes. For a girl, use her mother&#39;s old clothes. Avoid using new silk as it is inappropriate. The clothing should not be too thick, as it could harm the skin, affect the blood vessels, and cause rashes or jaundice. Babies should wear cotton fabric but must avoid heavy and warm clothing. Be cautious! When a baby is first born, their skin has not fully developed, and dressing them too warmly will weaken their muscles and bones. They should be allowed to be exposed to the wind and sunlight periodically. If they are kept from the wind entirely, their skin will become fragile and soft, making them more susceptible to injury. Just a few layers of clothing should be sufficient, and new cotton should be avoided.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the weather is warm and calm, the mother should take the child to play in the sunlight. Seeing the wind and sun occasionally will help the blood flow and strengthen the body, making the flesh resilient enough to withstand cold winds, thus preventing illness. However, if the child is constantly kept inside a blanket, swathed in heavy clothing, it is akin to the plants in a shaded place that do not see sunlight; they become soft and fragile, unable to endure the wind and cold.</p>
<p>As for the wrapping of the navel, use soft white cloth that has been beaten to make it pliable, about four inches square. Combine it with thick cotton, half an inch in thickness, to match its softness and tightness. If it is too tight, it may cause the child to vomit. The child should have their navel exposed for the first twenty days after birth. During the wrapping process, ensure the tent is warm by having a fire, and the same goes for changing clothes. This is referred to as dealing with winter cold.</p>
<p>After the child has bathed and the navel has been cut, once wrapped securely, they should not be given honey immediately; it is better to give them licorice decoction.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

Dip a cotton cloth in it and let the child suck on it until the liquid is consumed. The child should quickly vomit to expel the harmful bile from the stomach. If the child manages to vomit, there is no need to administer more medicine. If the child cannot vomit, proceed with caution. If they show signs of hunger or thirst, give them some more medicine in small amounts. If the previous medicine or any subsequent doses cannot be vomited, only give them just enough to finish this one cup. If they manage to vomit out the harmful bile, it will ensure the child&#39;s spirit and mind are clear and healthy. If the child drinks a full cup and does not vomit, it indicates that the child does not have harmful blood, so do not administer licorice soup again; instead, give them red honey to soothe their spirit and calm their soul. For newborns under three days old, giving too much red honey is not advisable, as it can lead to a cold stomach, abdominal bloating, and cause convulsions that may result in death.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Bathing Methods for Infants: When bathing an infant, it is crucial to ensure that the water is at a balanced temperature. If the water temperature is inappropriate, it can frighten the child and also lead to diseases of the internal organs. In winter, infants should not bathe for too long, as prolonged exposure can cause colds; in summer, they should also avoid lengthy baths, as this can cause overheating. Frequent bathing in cold water can result in convulsions; however, if not bathed, it may cause hair loss. For newborns, take the juice of one pig&#39;s bile and add it to the bath water, ensuring that they will not suffer from sores or scabies throughout their life; do not wash them with mixed water. On the third day after birth, it&#39;s advisable to bathe the child with peach root soup. Use two taels each of peach roots, plum roots, and apricot roots; branches can also be used. Crush them and boil in three buckets of water until it reaches a rolling boil, then strain it and use for bathing the infant, as it is effective for removing impurities and ensures a lifetime free from sores and scabies. To treat infant fright and ward off bad energy, bathe using mugwort and tiger bone soup. Use one pound of mugwort and one tiger skull, boiling them in three buckets of water for the bath. It is essential to use the soup immediately after boiling.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Confucian Approach to Parenting by Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Excessive Love for Infants Can Be Detrimental</strong></p>
<p>When infants are first born, their intestines and stomachs are delicate, easily hungry or full, easily weak or strong, and easily affected by cold or heat. This is well known, as stated in ancient texts. However, what is said in the &quot;Book of Rites&quot; regarding proper conduct and in Wang Fu&#39;s &quot;Qianfu Lun&quot; is not widely understood. The &quot;Book of Rites&quot; states: A young boy should not wear a fur cloak. It is said that a fur cloak is too warm and can diminish vital energy. Moreover, a person becomes an adult at fifteen, yet is still not permitted to wear a fur cloak.</p>
<p>In today’s society, people raise young children by warmly wrapping them in cloth during the summer, ensuring they do not go without warmth, and as soon as the weather becomes slightly chilly, they close off the room tightly, lower curtains, heat the bed, and use a red stove, making sure that even a small chill does not invade while keeping warmth contained. Even elderly people cannot endure such conditions, let alone pure yang children! A gentleman should also not create such excessive warmth in a closed space.</p>
<p>Wang Fu&#39;s &quot;Qianfu Lun&quot; mentions that an infant&#39;s illness often arises from overeating. In today&#39;s child-rearing practices, people do not observe how much their infant&#39;s stomach can actually hold; upon hearing a cry, they jump to conclude the baby is hungry and quickly feed it milk, without consideration for moderation, resulting in continuous feeding without caution. As the child grows and begins to eat, they are fed at whatever cue the child gives. An infant, having no means of expression, relies solely on its cries for communication. These two practices are sources of numerous illnesses.</p>
<p>Apart from ailments caused by prenatal conditions, infants can suffer from four specific types of illnesses: fright, malnutrition, vomiting, and diarrhea.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The source of illness lies in two things: one is satiety, the other is warmth. Shock is caused by fire overpowering the liver&#39;s wind-wood. Diarrhea is caused by heat overpowering the spleen&#39;s damp-earth. Vomiting occurs when fire overwhelms the stomach diaphragm, and in severe cases, it rises upwards. Diarrhea happens when fire acts on the liver and large intestine. Breast milk, being formed from blood that undergoes transformation by metal and is extremely cold, nourishes the flesh of infants effectively. However, the body is primarily water; thus, excessive intake of milk can lead to damp accumulation, resulting in combined damp-heat, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. Physicians who do not understand this principle hastily prescribe medicinal foods such as purple frost, metallic elements, and white cakes, which contain colocynth and almonds. The colocynth is greatly hot and highly toxic, while the almond is mildly hot and slightly toxic. If infants with yang heat are given heat-toxic medicine, the toxins will remain and eventually cause transformation into illness. Therefore, Mr. Liu Hejian uses non-toxic medicines like Tongsheng, Liangge, Shenxiong, and Yiyuan to treat these issues. Some say: this is a medicine for adults, not suitable for infants. I laughed and replied: although adults and children differ in age and vigor, do the five organs and six bowels differ? Adults take more, children take less; the essence is the same. Hence, for those who should not be purged, detoxification is appropriate; for those who can be purged, regulation of the stomach and heart is necessary. Since there are methods to expel dampness, I have previously made pills from the powdered mixture of Qian Niuxin (Morning Glory), Dahuang (Rhubarb), and Mutong (Menispermum) to treat various ailments in children, and it has been effective. This is primarily due to the accumulation of damp-heat from the consumption of breast milk in infants.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nowadays, many doctors criticize me for using this medicine. Since they do not understand the laws of nature, it is hard to argue with them. Therefore, I write this prescription for those in the future who are wise. However, those who are good at treating children should consider their wealth and status. In wealthy families, where there is an abundance of clothing and food, children often die young; in poor families, where there is a lack of food and clothing, children tend to grow strong. Children from poor families cannot indulge their desires, and though they may feel unsatisfied, they do not dare to express anger. Less anger leads to fewer liver ailments. In contrast, children from rich families can indulge their desires, and when things are slightly unsatisfactory, they become angry. More anger leads to more liver ailments. The liver corresponds to wood, and if it becomes excessive, it affects the spleen. Furthermore, poor families have limited resources and few medicines, leading to fewer deaths; rich families, with abundant wealth and medicines, face more deaths. Thus, although the upbringing in poor families may seem inferior compared to that in wealthy families, the successful growth of children in poorer families often surpasses that in wealthier ones. There are four principles that align with the natural way of raising children: 1) simple clothing and bland food, with few desires and little anger; 2) limited wealth and fewer medicines, allowing sickness to heal on its own, without being harmed by incompetent doctors and excessive heating tonics; 3) during pregnancy, the mother works, leading to the circulation of qi and blood, which nourishes the fetus; 4) when the mother works a lot, childbirth becomes easier. These four principles are contrary to those of wealthy families. There is a saying: &quot;When a child cries, it is a song; when they do not cry, they are not strong.&quot; This saying, though simple, touches upon the root of the issue: the common folks do not understand that crying is a way for children to release excess heat from their bodies.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Laozi said: &quot;Crying all day without losing my voice.&quot; I have once taught people the method of raising children: When the child can’t sit up yet, let them lie on a bare floor. In cold weather, do not give them thick clothes, just cloth, not cotton. When they can sit, use iron bells and wooden toys tied with thin strings, placed in a basin of water, to create sounds as they float and sink. During the hot summer, let them sit nearby, playing with water and the bells to dispel the heat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;The limbs are the foundation of all yang.&quot; If the hands are immersed in cold water, the yin energy reaches the heart; this is a remedy that requires no medicine. I once advised Chen Jingzhi: If a child is sick and there&#39;s no medicine, it is better to not use a mediocre doctor. However, I fear that the wife will blame him for not seeking treatment. It is advisable to soak and steam cakes to make them soft, forming them into small pills, deceiving the wife into thinking they are real medicine so the child can take them, and then leave things to fate; this is the best medicine.</p>
<p>In the year of Bingxu, many children fell ill with diarrhea, and those who used medicine all died. The reason is that the physicians did not understand the principles of dampness and heat, thus they treated with warmth and dryness, leading to death. Only Chen Jingzhi did not administer medicine and followed my advice, allowing the sick child to survive. Alas! Oh! Ban Gu truly a good historian once said: &quot;If one is sick and does not seek treatment, they receive traditional medicine. Avoiding violence can alleviate major illnesses; those who take medicine should be careful and familiarize themselves with yin and yang, without conspiring with others. Before sickness appears, following my methods of nurturing will also prevent illness. Even if there is a slight ailment, it is possible to avoid taking medicine.&quot;<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Nurturing the Young</strong></p>
<p>Before the age of sixteen, one&#39;s vital energies are robust, like the sun rising or the moon nearing fullness; however, the yin is still insufficient, and the stomach and intestines are delicate and narrow. Therefore, the method of nurturing must be approached with caution. Young boys should not wear fur or silk clothing, as the sayings of ancient sages indicate. Clothing for the lower body should be made of materials that are warmer and softer than cloth; fur garments provide warmth and softness beyond what silk can offer. The lower body corresponds to yin; if it becomes cold, the yin can easily grow, while warmth can dissipate the darkness of yin. Hence, if the lower body is not attired in thick, warm silk or similar materials, it may hinder the vital energies. This is a solid argument.</p>
<p>With abundant energy, digestion is easier, and thus eating occurs without set times. However, as the stomach and intestines remain delicate and narrow, foods that are sticky, dry, hard, sour, salty, sweet, spicy, as well as all fish, meat, fruit, and moist noodles, should be strictly avoided, especially those that are heating and difficult to digest. Instead, one should consume cooked vegetables and plain congee, which not only prevent illness but also help in cultivating virtue. Additionally, roasted chestnuts with a salty flavor and dried persimmons, which are cool in nature, can assist in nurturing yin.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, chestnuts are too astringent, and persimmons are too rich; both are difficult to digest and should be given sparingly. Women, lacking knowledge, only focus on indulgence, fearing their children’s cries and giving them whatever they want. This accumulates into illnesses, and once regret sets in, it is too late! Hence, those who are wealthy and indulge their children often find them sickly. By the time they reach adulthood, their muscles and bones are weak, and they cannot restrict their diet to nourish themselves properly. During mourning, they cannot adhere to vegetarian practices to fulfill their obligations. If they neglect minor details, they may compromise on greater principles; should one not be cautious?</p>
<p>As for the nursing mother, she should be especially prudent. Food that is swallowed affects the milk; emotional disturbances resonate in the milk’s flow. If sickness affects the milk, it will stagnate, and the child who consumes it will become ill—either vomiting or having diarrhea, or suffering from sores or fever, or experiencing night terrors or abdominal pain. At the onset of illness, the child&#39;s urine will be scant. The mother must inquire and adjust her care according to the symptoms; if the mother is well, then the child also will be well, thus preventing problems before they arise. The selection of food is a minor concern, yet the nursing mother’s condition—whether thin or rich, her temperament being soft or urgent, the strength or fragility of her bones, and her moral character—are all significant factors in how closely the child resembles her.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Moxibustion Methods</strong></p>
<p>Newborn infants are generally without ailments; one must be cautious not to apply moxibustion in the reverse manner. If moxibustion is done inversely, it causes pain and disrupts their vital channels, potentially leading to diseases. The region of He and Luo has a cold climate, causing infants to commonly suffer from spasms. For those born in this area, it is advisable to use moxibustion in reverse for the first three days to prevent this, as well as on the cheeks to guard against lockjaw. In cases of lockjaw, there will be a rapid pulse under the tongue and tightness in the gums. Due to the coldness of that land, blood should be drawn from under the tongue; thus, applying moxibustion to the cheeks prevents lockjaw. In the warmer climates of Wu and Shu, such ailments do not occur. Ancient methods have been handed down, yet contemporary practitioners often lack thorough understanding. Due to the differences between northern and southern regions, blindly following formulas can harm infants. Therefore, rural children, left to nature, generally thrive without complications. In cases where infants cry out in surprise and their limbs move restlessly during sleep, and their fever has not resolved, one must be extremely careful not to perform reverse moxibustion on the tips of their fingers, as it may disturb their vital channels and lead to seizures. Only in cases of inferred seizures and lockjaw is it permitted to apply moxibustion on the fingertips.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Newborn Care</strong></p>
<p>When a baby is born, before bathing, wrap them in soft cotton and keep them warm in the adult&#39;s embrace. The bathwater must be well-adjusted; if it&#39;s too hot or too cold, it will shock the baby and cause internal ailments. Even when bathing is complete, the baby should still be kept warm. During hot months, do not remove the cotton wrappings. Having just emerged from the womb, the baby must not be exposed to cold air. It is advisable to pre-prepare boiled water and keep it in a bottle, gently warming it as needed to avoid exposure to cold water, preventing sores from arising. If followed for a month, this method will promote healthy growth and reduce illness.</p>
<p>Before the baby is breastfed, use a small amount of Huanglian (Coptis) infused juice and mix it with dried red pigment on a shell to apply to the baby&#39;s mouth, clearing the remnants of old feces from their stomach. Only then should breastfeeding be introduced. Within three days, add a little vermilion to honey, mixing it into half a shell to administer. After one month, apply a small amount of niuhuang (cattle gall) gradually to the baby&#39;s mouth. If the baby salivates excessively, do not force them to breastfeed.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>Parents should be cautious of wind exposure to the child&#39;s neck area between the muscles, as many illnesses can arise from this region.

<p>The Book says: When Yang rises and Yin increases, the four seasons do not differ. All things derive their essence from the dual forces of Yin and Yang, and men and women are formed from their vital fluids. After three cycles, the Yin energy becomes pure and rich; the child is referred to as an infant. After two months, as Yin energy begins to flourish, the child is referred to as a sprout. At a hundred days, they are named with a star of nourishment, and after half a year, they gain strength. During the time when infants are nursed, Yin and Yang balance each other. After a thousand days, the vital essence is fully developed. At this point, the role of the wet nurse is crucial; if she can harmonize, all is well; if not, there is conflict. Moreover, harmony comes from a kind mother who can adjust to the cold and heat, nursing appropriately. Thus, all ailments are swiftly relieved, their appearance becomes pleasing, their bones and muscles strong, and their disposition exceptional.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

Additionally, there are situations where the wet nurse leaves the child’s clothing under the moonlight to dry overnight, where droppings from birds fall on the clothes, thus resulting in unfortunate diseases; or if they play with strange objects that frighten the child when seen suddenly, leading to shock. The Book states: &quot;Clothes laid under the moon invite unwarranted calamities; children, not fully formed, may suffer from contact with rare objects.&quot; All these are due to the mother’s mistakes, causing the child to lose essence and blood, leading to a darkened complexion and weakened limbs, ultimately contributing to illness and death.

In the Sui dynasty, the Chao family compiled the &quot;Bing Yuan,&quot; while in the Tang dynasty, Master Sun paid special attention to this field. Eventually, many talented physicians emerged, and renowned doctors became numerous. However, pediatric treatments are scattered across various texts. Despite extensive research on numerous writings, methods of treatment are often absent, offering only evidence without practical approaches. Zhang Huan provided formulas but lacked information on pulse diagnosis, while only the works of the Qian family are esteemed by both ancient and modern practitioners. It is said that the pulse of children is inherently difficult to verify and cannot be defined merely by language, particularly for infants and small children. Therefore, it focuses on one specific discipline. Ancients remarked on the difficulty of medicine, and in this pediatric field, practitioners can be significantly more advanced than general physicians. Although individuals vary in age, their ailments are similar, yet young children cannot express themselves.

In ancient times, when the divine farmer ruled the world, he observed people&#39;s disharmony and tasted the flavors of plants to determine salty, sour, sweet, and bitter, in order to treat diseases and chronic ailments. Salt softened, sourness astringed, sweetness eased, and bitterness strengthened. Remarkably, the pungent flavor encompassed all four qualities. He then sowed a hundred grains to nourish the human body. Ancient practices of residing in nests or caves did not obscure their path, allowing them to maintain their form and return to essence, guarding themselves through the Way, with strong and resilient vital energy and blood.

<p><strong>On the Guidance of Raising Children</strong></p>
<p>The art of raising children is often called the &quot;Mute Discipline.&quot; When they cannot speak and pulses show no signs, we can only rely on their physical appearance for guidance. Thus, those who are good at nurturing children treat them as they would a nurturing dragon; while those who are poor at it do so as one would pet a calf with affection. The more care you provide, the greater the harm can become. At times, a child’s head may be warm while their feet are cold; they may cry often but refuse to feed. A slight deviation can lead to significant missteps. Their intestines and stomach are delicate, easily harmed by food; their muscles and bones are weak, easily affected by wind and cold. What do parents know, as they cling to the notion of tradition? Heavy blankets and thick clothing may inadvertently consume the yang energy while exhausting the yin; careless feeding and overflow of food only ruin the spleen and damage the stomach. Unfamiliar sounds and sights may lead to carelessness; one may confine a child too much within the home while limiting their outings excessively. Premature attempts to make them stand are taken as signs of growth; laughing and playing without purpose is mistaken for cleverness. Yet, once illness strikes, the parents are filled with anxiety. They trust shamans over doctors, seeking spirits rather than remedies. Such failures in human responsibility are mistakenly attributed to fate.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>A Poem on Subtlety</strong></p>
<p>The art of medicine is vast, yet pediatrics is the most challenging. Like the tender sprout, it thrives on careful nurturing; like the silkworm’s shoot, it requires cautious preservation. When blood and energy have not yet filled them, their pulses cannot be diagnosed; when their awareness has not yet awakened, their mouths cannot articulate. Truly seeking in one’s heart, observing closely on the surface. If one grasps the essentials, they can wield transformation in skilled hands; if one fails to understand the intent, they merely extract phrases from fragmented texts. If care is misplaced, illness will arise. The head must be kept cool while the back needs warmth, food should not be plentiful and clothing should not be too soft. The intestines and stomach are delicate; overfeeding can lead to accumulation; if the spirit is timid and frail, strange sights and sounds can induce spasms. Alas, kind mother, you are too indulgent; laughing at those who are clumsy, you err with ineffective remedies. Sapping the essence of growth, you stifle the years of youth. Merely wailing in the fields, cease worship at the altars.</p>
<p><strong>Children Should Not Be Recklessly Treated with Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>Tender buds cannot endure harm; do not recklessly try acupuncture or remedies. Breaking flesh and damaging tendons lead to thinness and illness; spoiling intestines and harming stomachs cause lasting misfortunes. Newly born infants are fragile inside and out; they certainly cannot tolerate medicinal stones or acupuncture. Good practitioners should care for others&#39; children as they would their own, treating them gently, caressing them; do not take light actions to avoid causing misfortune. The text states: &quot;To protect the infant is to nurture it with love.&quot; Parents must bear this in mind.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Care for them by being cautious of their fears</p>
<p>Young children are naturally weak in spirit. They may suddenly encounter unusual sights, unfamiliar people, sounds of roosters crowing or dogs barking, or see cattle and horses, and be startled or frightened by playful activities. They might hear calls and shouts from others, or the thunderous sounds of explosions, and it is impossible for them not to be disturbed, leading to illness due to fright. The heart stores the spirit, and fright damages the spirit; the kidneys store will, and fear causes loss of will. This holds true for all adults, but is even more pronounced in children. When children are playing, they must not be allowed to recklessly point at objects and imagine them to be insects or snakes. If a child cries, they should not be deceived by disguises to stop their crying, as it can confuse their spirit, making them timid and fearful. One must be cautious.</p>
<p>Children should play with things within reach; these should not be taken away from them. However, they must not be allowed to handle knives or swords, carry money, or be near water or fire, and they should not see spirits or ghosts. </p>
<p>When children begin to speak, they should be taught proper language and not be allowed to use vulgar expressions. If they can eat, they should be taught to do so respectfully, avoiding rudeness. If they can sit or walk, they should be supported to prevent falls. Relatives and community members should teach them to understand the distinctions of kinship, respect, and the hierarchy of age and seniors, ensuring they do not behave disdainfully.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a child is born, the depth of love and care can lead to neglect in their upbringing. If the care is excessive, it can create a hot environment; if they are overfed, it can lead to accumulation.

Liu Zhi in &quot;The Transmission of Growing Trees&quot; states that although it is said to love, in reality, it can cause harm. This is taken as a metaphor. </p>
<p>A saying goes: If you want a child to be peaceful, they should often experience a bit of hunger and cold. Hunger refers to moderating their diet, while cold means adapting to a suitable temperature, implying they should not be too full or too warm; this is not an erroneous claim of not feeding or not clothing. </p>
<p>The head should be kept cool and the back warm, exposing the lower body to nurture the true yin. One should not violate the seasons; during spring, cold and heat should not conflict with the body’s natural conditions. </p>
<p>This describes the method of adjusting temperature. The head is where the six yang energies converge and must remain cool, not bundled up. The abdomen represents yin and the back represents yang; both should be warm and protected from exposure. A child&#39;s pure yang energy lacks yin, so the lower body should be exposed to connect with the earth’s energy to nourish their yin. The seasons also refer to cold and heat. Spring represents a gentle and warm atmosphere, which all living things rely on for growth. This means that in swaddling, cold should not harm the cold, and heat should not harm the heat, so that the child can grow in a pleasant and mild environment like that of spring.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

Although grains and meats exist, they should not be given, as they would disturb the harmony in the stomach and intestines.

<p>The navel is situated between the two kidneys, connecting to the three vessels of the stomach. Upon a child&#39;s birth, the cutting and care of the navel must be done with extreme caution. Therefore, at the time of cutting the navel, doing it through clothing is the best method; cutting it with fire is the next best; using scissors and then cauterizing it is the least favorable. </p>
<p>For the care of the navel: once it is cut, wrap it in a soft cloth and allow it to fall off naturally when dry; avoid getting it wet. During the three days after birth, when washing the baby, take care to keep water from touching the navel. After the navel has fallen, change the swaddling cloth frequently to prevent urine from wetting it. By following this careful approach, one can avoid the condition known as &quot;navel wind.&quot; The so-called expert treats illnesses before they arise, achieving perfect success.</p>
<p>Children&#39;s ailments can be attributed to three main causes: clothing that is too thick causes overheating, while clothing that is too thin leads to chill; these are external factors. If there is too much milk, the child feels full; if there is too little, the child feels hungry; these variations are internal causes. Additionally, external factors such as being affected by evil influences or falling and getting hurt also contribute to illness. </p>
<p>By aligning with the seasonal weather and adjusting to its warmth or cold, one can avoid issues arising from temperature extremes. Careful selection of a wet nurse and regulating her diet help prevent any problems associated with hunger and fullness. Care and attention in nursing are essential to avoid neglect.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Infant&#39;s Hundred Questions</strong> <em>(Ming Dynasty, Ru Boxi)</em></p>
<p><strong>Birth</strong></p>
<p>When an infant is in the womb, it receives the energies of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements, thus forming the Five Visceral Organs and Six Bowels. The entire body is fully developed, and it must rely on amniotic fluid for nourishment. Once the qi is sufficient, natural birth follows. Upon leaving the mother&#39;s body, the infant may have toxic fluids in the mouth and may not cry immediately, so it is essential to quickly use soft cloth to wipe away the foul juices from the mouth. Although this is a good method, in hurried situations, some may not do it properly. The ancients had methods involving huanglian (Coptis), zhumi (honey), and licorice, which are particularly effective. This prevents the ingestion of harmful substances that settle in the heart. When exposed to seasonal ailments, if such toxins persist due to warmth, they can spread through the bloodstream, overflow into the stomach, and since the stomach governs muscle, this may manifest as sores and rashes. No one, young or old, can escape this. If one follows the method of wiping the mouth at birth, they may avoid the affliction of pox and rashes. Sometimes, if seasonal illnesses invade, only superficial skin ailments manifest, which can be easily managed—this is indeed fortunate for the child. Yang said: if the mouth is not wiped at birth and impurities enter the stomach, this can lead to abdominal fullness and shortness of breath, preventing the infant from breastfeeding; in such cases, one should use a modified formula with Poria pills for treatment. Moreover, to expel fetal toxins during labor, drinking a concentrated decoction of light fermented soybean juice is excellent, but one must avoid substances like cinnabar, huanglian, and light powder.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nurturing Method</p>
<p>When a baby is newly born, their skin is not yet firm, and they should not be dressed in warm clothing. Only thin clothing should be used, ensuring the back is kept warm. This thin clothing method should be adopted from autumn; one must not abruptly reduce clothing in spring or summer, as this could invite wind and cold. Thus, following the adaptation from autumn allows for gradual acclimatization to cold. In winter, wearing two thin garments is sufficient to endure the cold; if it feels too cold, a slight addition is acceptable. However, if one excessively warms them out of love, it may actually be harmful. </p>
<p>Moreover, one must pay attention to the baby&#39;s condition, ensuring they do not sweat. If sweating occurs, it indicates a weakness on the surface, making them susceptible to external wind evil. Whether awake or asleep, one should always be cautious. The breastfeeding method should also be regulated to avoid overfeeding. If there is stagnation and inability to digest, one should use breast milk pills or other remedies to transform accumulated heat and strengthen the spleen. As Chen states: endure a slight chill, eat moderately, rub the belly frequently, bathe infrequently, and ensure the back, belly, and feet are warm while keeping the head and chest cool; this advice holds true.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Infant Feeding and Illness</strong></p>
<p>When infants suffer, their mothers are to blame. Before birth, they fail to be cautious with their diet; after birth, they are unable to provide proper care. Hence, they only seek to indulge the child, neglecting to prevent minor issues from becoming significant problems. Some children are given sour or salty foods before they reach the age of one hundred days, or rich and fatty foods before they are even a year old, leading to various illnesses: vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, malnutrition, abdominal swelling, edema, malaria, dysentery, and wheezing. Are these not the results of excessive eating and inappropriate dietary adjustments?</p>
<p><strong>On Medication for Newborns</strong></p>
<p>I foolishly suggest that for infants within the first month or so, tonic medicines should be administered in doses of two to three spoonfuls. For dispersing or attacking medicines, only a spoonful should be given at a time; too much will harm their vital energy. Dosages should be adjusted according to the size and condition of the child. If the mother is ill and it affects the child, the focus should be on treating the mother, and the child should receive minimal medication.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method of Initial Birth</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, if they have blood clots in their mouth, it is crucial to clean this before they cry. Use a soft cloth wrapped around the finger to wipe away the blood, and then administer a mixture of Huang Lian (Coptis), Dou Chi (Fermented Soybeans), Zhusha (Cinnabar), honey, and licorice to detoxify. However, Huang Lian is cold in nature; if the mother has consumed rich foods that generate heat, it is appropriate to use it. Conversely, if the child is weak and has a bland constitution, it is not advisable. While Zhusha can effectively detoxify, it has a tendency to anchor one down, so it is better to use Niuhuang (Cattle Gallstone) in moderation mixed with honey for sucking. Many in the world use Xijiao (Rhinoceros Horn) detoxification pills, but for those with weak and cold vital energy, these can harm the spleen and stomach, potentially leading to infertility. Additionally, if an infant suffers from a difficult birth or is exposed to wind and cold, the umbilical cord should not be cut hastily. Quickly warm cotton and cradle the child, placing the placental tissue over fire to gently heat, and apply burning paper around the umbilical cord to bring warmth into the abdomen, allowing the vital energy to recover swiftly. Bathing should especially be avoided, as it may disrupt the pulse and lead to the escape of the original qi, making the child susceptible to external pathogens.</p>
<p><strong>Method of Nurturing</strong></p>
<p>Upon birth, it is essential for the wet nurse to be cautious about emotional disturbances and rich flavors. If the milk is pure and calm, the child will be healthy. Otherwise, imbalances in yin and yang can lead to turbulent blood and qi, spoiling the milk, which will surely result in various ailments. Frequent use of medications may harm the internal organs and lead to serious complications that should not be overlooked. Generally, the method of caring for infants is to adjust and care for the wet nurse when the child is healthy and to carefully treat the infant when they are unwell, always ensuring the mother is also treated effectively.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Guidelines: Initial Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Tian Shi says: Generally, when infants are too warm, it causes heat; excessive heat leads to wind; holding them excessively results in sores; feeding them improperly leads to afflictions. Caution is especially necessary. Qian explains: Feeding milk after great joy often leads to convulsions; feeding milk after intense crying often causes vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Treatises</strong></p>
<p>Wang Yinjun states: For infants, after sixty days, their pupils begin to form, and they can start responding to human emotions. From this onset of recognition, parents and elders should gradually guide them in appropriate behavior. Servants and maids should not be allowed to train the child in mock dances, disrespect, shouting, or rough pushing and dodging. Even if the child appears to smile, they may be frightened and distressed, leading to an unruly temperament. If a wet nurse indulges in rich flavors and strong alcoholic essences, the infant also absorbs this through milk, resulting in various ailments. When sick, they should avoid bitter and spicy medications. Indulgence and tolerance can lead to serious issues. The mother&#39;s affection, often excessive, manifests in the food she craves, allowing the child to overindulge, leading to harm. In my childhood, I had a strong taste for sweet confections, but one day I discovered a worm emerging from a sweet treat, after which I could not bring myself to eat sweets. Only upon growing up did I understand the reasons for such caution. If not, persistent ailments will deepen and become difficult to remedy, causing irreparable harm.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Nurturing</strong></p>
<p>The text from &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; states: A child&#39;s bones form after two hundred forty days, so the mother should teach them to crawl. By the end of a week, the mother should support them to walk. This is all proper training. If one were to dress them in heavy clothing, keep them from sunlight and fresh air, preventing contact with the earth, it could lead to weak muscles and bones, causing some children to be unable to walk for years. Observing children in rural areas reveals the opposite; they benefit from exposure to sunlight and fresh air, keeping their muscles strong. Isn&#39;t this principle independent of wealth or status? Understanding this leads to the proper methods of child-rearing.</p>
<p><strong>Breastfeeding</strong></p>
<p>The methods of breastfeeding must be approached with caution. Infants have weak spleens and stomachs, and are easily harmed by food. Initial vomiting and diarrhea can cause long-term digestive issues. The diet of the wet nurse affects the breast milk; if she eats hot food, the milk becomes hot; if she eats cold food, the milk becomes cold. Consuming hot milk in summer can cause vomiting, while cold milk in winter may lead to cough and diarrhea. The mother should avoid anger; anger raises her Qi and causes chaos; she should avoid drunkenness as well, since it creates heat and abdomen pain. During pregnancy and while nursing, if care is not taken, it can lead to a yellowish and emaciated appearance, with a swollen abdomen and soft feet, referred to as &quot;bile disease.&quot; Generally, breastfeeding should not be excessive. A saying goes: &quot;Children often fall ill from overeating.&quot; It is also advised: &quot;Endure a little hunger, eat until seven parts full.&quot; This is indeed a wise principle.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Elimination of Fetal Toxins</strong></p>
<p>The medical texts all state: When a newborn emerges from the womb and before it cries out, one should quickly use cotton to wipe away the foul fluid from its mouth. This is indeed a good practice; however, in urgent situations, there may be times one cannot do this. Thus, methods using ingredients like Coptis, licorice, vermilion, honey, etc., can be especially beneficial. Dongyuan says: Simply brew a decoction of light fermented soybean and give it to the child, three to five mouthfuls. The toxins will be expelled naturally, and it can also help with the stomach energy, which is particularly wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Newborns</strong></p>
<p>For newborns, it is essential to avoid contact with outsiders. The ancients believed that for the first year of life, children should not be exposed to guests to prevent any undue harm. Children who can recognize people should not be taken to temples to view the flickering images of deities, as this may instill fear. As summer approaches, sew seven peeled apricot kernels into a sachet for the child to carry with them, which will help them remain calm during thunder.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Pig&#39;s Milk</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Huan argues: At birth, if the mother has not yet produced milk, pig&#39;s milk can be used as a substitute, preventing seizures, itchy skin, and pox. Qian&#39;s theory states: For newborns up to a month old, it is best to frequently give them droplets of pig&#39;s milk. According to the &quot;Senghui Formulas,&quot; to obtain pig&#39;s milk, the piglet must first be allowed to suckle from its mother. Then, one should lift the hind legs of the sow so that the piglet releases its latch. Quickly squeeze out the milk by hand; this is the only proper method to obtain it.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Bathing Method</strong></p>
<p>For infants, the umbilical cord should not be cut before bathing; it should be cut afterward to prevent water from wetting the stump, which could avoid issues like umbilical wind and sores. Use clean oil mixed with ash to protect the umbilical area. Do not let water get the umbilical cord wet during bathing.</p>
<p><strong>Umbilical Cord Cutting Method</strong></p>
<p>Generally, after the umbilical cord is cut at birth, it should be wrapped in moxa for protection. If the wet nurse is not careful, or if bathing water gets into the cord, or if urine is trapped in the wraps, moisture can injure the cord. Furthermore, exposure to cold and wet air can lead to the infant’s cord swelling and excessive crying, preventing them from breastfeeding, which results in umbilical wind.</p>
<p><strong>Clothing Method</strong></p>
<p>According to the &quot;Shenghui,&quot; clothing for infants within the first month should be made from old fabric and not from new cotton. If new cotton is used, it may cause the infant to become overheated or lead to seizures.</p>
<p><strong>Clothing Drying Method</strong></p>
<p>Generally, infants’ clothes should be dried in the sun during the day and taken inside at night; they should not be left outdoors overnight. Wearing clothes that have been exposed to dew can cause dampness and heat, making the infant uncomfortable. This is known as the harm of the Eight Evils, which if prolonged, can lead to jaundice, weight loss, abdominal pain, excessive heat at night, crying, or the development of sores or scabs. Commonly, people refer to these conditions as &quot;innocent illnesses,&quot; attributing them to clothes left outside overnight accumulating harmful substances, but this is misguided. The ancients referred to the Eight Evils as being influenced by warmth, cold, fright, and imbalanced feeding.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Methods for Raising Children</strong></p>
<p>Eating hot, soft, and in moderation prevents illness; eating cold, hard, and in excess leads to sickness. Endure a bit of cold, eat until moderately full. Frequently rub the abdomen, and bathe less. A verse says: To keep children safe through the seasons, maintain a state of slight hunger and chill. If everyone follows this method, naturally, illnesses will not concern them.</p>
<p><strong>Ten Principles for Raising Children</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep the back warm. The classics say: The two sides below the third vertebra of the back correspond to the lungs. If wind and cold harm the lung area, it causes the hair to stand upright, skin to close, resulting in heat-related illnesses. Symptoms may include cough, shortness of breath, nausea, or chest fullness with cold and heat, all from cold affecting the lung meridian. Therefore, keep the back warm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep the abdomen warm. There is a saying: A cold belly means a cold stomach. The abdomen is the stomach, the sea of water and grains. If cold, food will not digest, leading to abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. The classics say: A warm stomach can digest grains; thus, keep the abdomen warm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep the feet warm. The classics state: The feet govern the yangming stomach meridian. Cold arises from below, so the feet must be warm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep the head cool. The classics say: The head is where the six yang converge and gather all yang energy.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The head is the sea of marrow; if exposed to great heat, the marrow overflows, leading to sweating and leakage. This can cause swelling of the skull, openings in the sutures, or sores and eye ailments. It is commonly said that &quot;the head cannot be too cool.&quot; Therefore, the head should be kept cool.</p>
<p>Next, the heart and chest must also be kept cool. The heart is associated with fire; if it encounters external heat while internal heart fire is present, both inside and outside will become hot. If the symptoms are mild, there may be dry mouth and parched tongue, flushed cheeks, and a reddened face. If severe, there may be crying, agitation, and jumping. Thus, the heart should be kept cool.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the spirit is not whole, young children may suddenly see something extraordinary, an unfamiliar person, or hear the crowing of a rooster or barking of a dog. They might unexpectedly see cattle or horses, play in fear, or suddenly hear loud noises, leading to involuntary responses. This happens due to a deficiency in the heart&#39;s qi, causing the spirit to disperse. It is advisable to use tonifying heart and qi medicines for treatment. However, if using sedative medicines such as cinnabar, gallstone, amber, gold, silver, brains, musk, or mercury, this could lead to chronic wind seizures, resulting in abdominal distension and cold feet, making treatment ineffective.</p>
<p>Lastly, if the spleen and stomach are not kept warm, it can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and chronic seizures.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The classics say: The spleen is the Yellow Mother, and the stomach is the Golden Father, responsible for nourishing the five organs and six bowels. If the spleen and stomach are fully solid, then fluids circulate freely, and qi and blood flow smoothly, creating harmony between the exterior and interior, resulting in overall health. The spleen and stomach belong to the earth element and are averse to dampness. </p>
<p>If children develop fever, with swollen upper lips and a hot head, or exhibit heat and agitation, and the parents are unaware, they may mistakenly treat it as a cold or food injury, employing exterior herbs to induce sweating, using purgatives to expel, or cooling herbs to calm the heart, or applying balmy decoctions to alleviate symptoms. This leads to an imbalance of heat and cold, causing internal damage to the spleen and stomach, which may affect the large intestine, resulting in greenish stools. If this persists, vomiting is inevitable, and continued vomiting can lead to convulsions. </p>
<p>Convulsions, characterized by heat, are treated with cooling herbs. However, this can further undermine the true qi, leading to a situation where recovery is increasingly difficult. The classics state: If the spleen and earth are weak, the liver and wood will dominate. Hence, muscle spasms occur, necessitating the use of herbs to tonify the spleen, warm the stomach, and smooth the qi for treatment, so that recovery may be attained.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

<li><p>When the infant is still unsettled from crying, do not let them drink milk, as it can lead to vomiting of greenish milk and feces. When the child is in the womb, if the mother excessively takes in cool air, it will cause coldness to invade the fetus. After the child is born, if they cry in sadness and are immediately given milk, the combination of air and food can become trapped inside, leading to damage to the spleen and stomach. This may result in mild symptoms such as vomiting greenish milk and feces; in severe cases, it can lead to gurgling noises in the abdomen, reversed airflow, and excessive saliva, making it difficult to treat.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Breastfeeding</p>
<p>Tang said: For infants, breastfeeding must be done properly. &quot;Milk&quot; refers to breast milk, and &quot;feeding&quot; refers to food. After breastfeeding, do not immediately offer solid food, and after feeding, do not immediately offer milk. Infants have weak spleen and stomach, and combining milk and food makes digestion difficult. After one year, this will lead to milk and food stagnation in the abdomen, causing pain and heat, and thus development of malnutrition. </p>
<p>Generally, the milk of a wet nurse is derived from her blood and energy. The emotions of joy and anger all arise from the blood and energy, so she should avoid strong emotions and all taboos. The nurse must not have conditions like foul body odor, goiter, cough, scabs, baldness, thick lips, deafness, hoarseness, nasal flaring, or epilepsy, as these may affect the infant negatively.</p>
<p>During hot summer months, after the wet nurse bathes or when the baby cries, do not offer milk, as it may lead to stomach toxins and cause dysentery in fall. After bathing, it is advisable to let the nurse rest for a long while until the heat dissipates before breastfeeding, thus avoiding problems.</p>
<p>Nie said: If the baby cries excessively, do not provide milk. This may cause disordered energy to rise, potentially leading to convulsions. </p>
<p>The &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; says: If the baby wants more milk, one should remove the baby, knead the breast, and then offer milk again. If parents are engaged in intimacy and the child is lying to the side or wakes up in surprise, do not offer breastfeeding, as the chaotic energy may harm the baby.</p>
<p>Cao said: If the baby is crying and breath not stable, the mother should not breastfeed. This is to avoid obstructing the flow of milk, which may lead to nausea.</p>

<p>As for the aforementioned milk issues, they urgently affect infants and can lead to various illnesses, thus they should not be overlooked. In general, if there is emotional disturbance from joy or anger in the mother, the child will experience vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and failure to eat due to malnutrition.

Do not bath the baby under eaves, undress in the wind, or nurse while he is still crying, as this can lead to cold exposure during feeding. Avoid being near spirits or animals, and do not touch various belongings of different families, as this might harm the child&#39;s nature and cause seizures. The classics state: Before reaching three years, do not feed chicken, as it leads to worms in the child&#39;s belly. </p>
<p>Qian Yi states: A child often suffers from excessive care. If they are still not eating well by two or three years, their spleen and stomach may become weak, leading to frequent illness. After six months, it is best to give them thin rice porridge and sometimes noodle soup. After ten months, gradually introduce thicker porridge to strengthen their energy and make them easier to raise with fewer illnesses. Avoid raw, cold, oily, and sweet foods. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Wai Tai,&quot; Cui&#39;s method for the initial feeding of children aligns with auspicious days such as the Day of the Earth or the Days of the Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, and Rooster.

<p>When a child reaches the age of four or five and is reluctant to wean, it is advisable to use eyebrow balm. After weaning, one may gradually introduce meat into their diet, which will help prevent the risk of malnutrition.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Care Methods</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Huan said: The wet nurse should daily at three times touch the child&#39;s crown at the Fengchi point. If the child has a strong fever, one must apply compresses to induce slight sweating for recovery. It is said: &quot;Be cautious in raising children, and carefully protect the Fengchi point.&quot; The Fengchi point is located at the side of the neck where the tendons meet; treat it only when there is illness. Do not recklessly employ acupuncture or other invasive methods, nor should one induce vomiting or diarrhea, as these can harm a child&#39;s meridians and disrupt their internal organs. During summer, keep the infant in a somewhat cool place; the wet nurse should not restrict them from drinking fresh water, but it should not be excessive. If an infant shows illness in spring or summer, one must avoid indiscriminate purging, as it may lead to deficiencies in the lower body and excess heat in the upper body, resulting in severe illness. Infants should be considered differently based on their geographic origins, as the temperature of the earth varies. After two full months of life, the infant’s eyes and smiles develop, and they can recognize people. The wet nurse must not allow strangers to hold the child, nor should the child be exposed to unusual objects.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Precious Mirror&quot; states: When cutting the cord, if using scissors, warm them first in your bosom.

<p>Zhang Huan says: On the first day after birth, once the cord is cut and the clothing is finished, observe the child&#39;s complexion. If the face is rosy and appears vibrant, and the cries are loud and quick, then apply mercury powder, as it is good for relieving any remaining cord remnants. Next, use licorice; then apply red honey. Continue to observe the complexion; if it appears more pale and blue, and the cries are weak, there is no need for medication. Next, you may use buffalo horn powder.

<p>Cui says: The child&#39;s clothing should be washed with clear water, ensuring it is not soiled by sand, dirt, or grass; then wash it again with clear wine. Place a coin inside the clothing, put it in a new jar, wrap it in green cotton, tightly seal the jar, and keep it in a suitable place. After three days, on an auspicious day of the month, bury it in a sunlit, high, and dry area, three feet deep, with at least one foot and seven inches of soil above the jar, sealed well. This will bring longevity and wisdom. If not careful, it may become food for pigs and dogs, leading to madness; if eaten by insects or ants, it may cause illnesses or sores; if eaten by dogs or birds, it may lead to death in war. Near a community shrine, it may cause visions of ghosts; near deep or dirty water, it may lead to drowning; near an old stove, it may cause fright; near a well, it may cause deafness or blindness. Abandoning it in roads or alleys may lead to the end of descendants; placing it at a doorway may cause silence or deafness; in flowing water may lead to green blindness; in fire may cause rotten sores; in trees may lead to self-hanging. These taboos must be observed with caution. Bury it during the time of Heavenly Virtue and the Void of the month. [In the first month, Heavenly Virtue is on Ding, and Void on Bing and Ren. For further details, refer to the official calendar.] If an opposing day occurs, it is better to hang it outside the house in a place of fortune, facing the sun in a high and dry area, and wait until the month has passed before proceeding to bury it according to the rules, which is auspicious. If born on a Jia or Yi day, bury it on Bing or Ding days; if born on Bing or Ding days, bury it on Wu or Ji days; if born on Wu or Ji days, bury it on Geng or Xin days; if born on Geng or Xin days, bury it on Ren or Gui days, which is auspicious.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p>When shaving the head, it should be done in a warm place, avoiding the wind. After shaving, three peeled and crushed apricot kernels should be mixed with three leaves of mint, ground together, then added with three or four drops of raw sesame oil, combined with powder, and applied on the head to ward off wind and evil spirits, preventing sores, scabs, and heat toxins.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Li Chen)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On the Umbilicus of Newborns</strong></p>
<p>The umbilicus of a person, at the time of birth, is formed by the mingling of the father’s essence and the mother’s blood. It comes together and solidifies, with the fetal body in a state of chaos. From the undifferentiated state of Taiji, the primordial qi separates into two and six (yin and yang). Inside the womb, there are four spaces that correspond with the two kidneys externally and two vessels—one red and one white—internally. Among these four spaces, there is division between surface and interior. Inside the mother’s belly, the mother breathes in and the baby breathes out; as the mother inhales, the baby inhales as well, forming a whole through the umbilical cord, just as flowers and fruits are connected through their stems.</p>
<p>One month after birth, the true qi gradually becomes sufficient. Once the placenta has been delivered, the umbilical cord is slowly cut. If the umbilical opening has not closed, exposure to wind or cold may harm the baby&#39;s true qi. Therefore, it is advisable to use mugwort to fumigate and steam multiple times, ensuring the true qi is protected. When a newborn is first handled, use cotton to wrap the umbilical cord, two to three inches away from the belly, securing it with cotton and then cutting the umbilical cord with thread outside the secured area; wait a moment for the blood to flow out completely. </p>
<p>Upon examining the area close to the belly, the umbilicus has two small holes and one large hole. Use a goose feather tube to introduce a small amount of umbilical medicine into the large hole, gently massaging it with a fingertip. Perform moxibustion on the umbilicus three times, then bind it with a soft cloth, ensuring it is not frequently uncovered. Allow the umbilicus to fall naturally, as this will prevent exposure to wind.</p>
<p>Additionally, when the placenta is expelled, if the umbilicus is soft, there is no need for treatment. However, if the umbilicus is hard and straight, it indicates umbilical wind. Quickly use a silver hairpin to prick one or two places near the umbilical root, then apply a small amount of musk and perform moxibustion three times, which is highly effective.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Concealing the Afterbirth</h3>
<p>The afterbirth of a newborn should be buried in auspicious directions. It is best to do this in the first month during the proper timing: during the second month (Chou), the third month (Yin), the fourth month (Mao), the fifth month (Chen), the sixth month (Si), the seventh month (Wu), the eighth month (Wei), the ninth month (Shen), the tenth month (You), the eleventh month (Xu), and the twelfth month (Hai). If the auspicious direction is inconvenient, it should be buried according to the calendar in the direction of the Doctor of Writing on the moon’s virtue, avoiding directions ruled by emptiness, three killings, and the Grand Duke. It is improper to place it in the river.</p>
<h3>Nurturing and Care</h3>
<p>Raising a child requires careful nurturing; attention is necessary, and one must not be lax. Too much milk will damage the stomach, while obstructive foods will harm the spleen. Too thick clothing does not benefit; appropriate clothing should be light. Avoid wind and seek sunlight; maintain harmony with the seasons. In the first three to five months after birth, the infant should be swaddled and laid down, and should not be held upright to avoid startling fits. Only after six months can one offer thin porridge, avoiding mixing with milk to prevent sores. Meat may be introduced only after the age of five.</p>
<h3>Restoration of Health</h3>
<p>Upon birth, it is advisable to dress the newborn in old skirts and coats from elderly individuals aged seventy or eighty, transformed into baby clothes, as this helps nurture the vital energy and grants longevity. In wealthy families, it is crucial not to dress the child in new silk or brocade, as this could not only lead to illness but also diminish fortune, potentially resulting in untimely death.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Bathing Infants</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, it is essential to bathe them first, to cleanse away impurities, and then the umbilical cord can be severed. If the cord is cut first, the bathwater may enter the navel, leading to conditions like navel sores. The bathing water must be prepared with medicinal herbs beforehand, stored in a bottle, and warmed up as needed, avoiding fresh water for the best results. Additionally, for subsequent baths, medicinal decoctions should also be used, choosing appropriate days and times, which is very beneficial. Generally, bathing should occur within the first hundred days during the hours of the Tiger and Rabbit. If the infant&#39;s first few days do not fall on these times, bathing can still be done at midday during three specific hours. It is crucial to avoid the days and times of Ren Wu, Ding Si, and Gui Si as they are greatly inauspicious. All other times are acceptable.</p>
<p>Using a pig bile broth for bathing infants prevents sores and skin conditions, making their skin smooth and moist. A decoction of gold, silver, tiger bone, and cinnabar repels evil spirits and calms fears; using only tiger bone is also sufficient. A mixture of half a pound of sliced plum leaves helps to disperse muscular heat and alleviate excess warmth. A decoction made of two taels of Bai Zhi and three taels of Ku Shen, crushed and boiled, can dispel all kinds of wind ailments.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

<p>After childbirth, a child must be bathed regularly to remove dirt, but not excessively. If bathing is neglected, the skin will become rough, hair will fall out, and sores or scabies may develop. During bathing, use a little water on the back and allow more on other areas. Do not overly soak the back, nor let the child sit in water for too long, as it may induce fright and illness; care must be taken!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Cutting the Umbilical Cord</strong></p>
<p>When a child is born, the umbilical cord must be cut at the proper time. If it is not cut in time, the cord juice remains, leading to coldness, which causes umbilical wind. The cord should be cut to a length that reaches the ankle, or about six inches. If it is too short, it can harm the organs, causing imbalance in the child&#39;s abdomen; if too long, it can harm the flesh, causing the child&#39;s skin to become dry and scaly. Immediately after cutting the cord, one must use a cord moxibustion cake, placing it over the cord stump and burning it three times, with each treatment about the size of a grain of wheat. If the child has not cried, apply moxibustion five to seven times. After the moxibustion, one should seal the cord stump with a cord seal powder. The fabric used should be beaten to make it soft, about four inches square, with a layer of new cotton half an inch thick placed on top, and medication powder sprinkled on, properly tightening and sealing it. If the necessary medicine is not on hand, a finely ground piece of cooked mugwort may also be used for sealing. However, the cloth should not be sealed too tightly, as this may cause the child to vomit. Additionally, constant care is required to ensure it does not get wet or contact the swaddling cloth, and the child’s urine must not wet it, as this could lead to sores, swelling, or attract wind.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Sengji Jing&quot; states: When a child is born and has not absorbed the unhealthy blood, it should be wiped with cotton and if it is swallowed and remains in the chest, induce vomiting. Use licorice for this purpose. If it has entered the abdomen, use a powder of Coptis to induce a purge. These are all methods to cleanse impurities. Next, take about a bean-sized quantity of good vermilion, finely ground and dissolved in water, and mixed with honey from a clam shell, adjusting the thickness to form a paste. Divide this into three doses, administering one dose at a time by mixing it with breast milk and dropping it into the child&#39;s mouth. Complete the doses within three days. Yao He and others say that prepared vermilion can warm the intestines and stomach, and invigorate blood and qi. Only one bean-sized dose is allowed per day, divided into three times; do not exceed this. Then use genuine ox gall, about the size of a bean, finely ground and prepared with honey to the size of a sour jujube, forming a paste. Each time, use a large bean-sized amount, dissolved in breast milk and dropped into the child’s mouth. Yao He and others say it can dispel fright and eliminate malevolent energy. However, if the child&#39;s appearance is weak or frail, it should not be administered. If the child shows signs of heat or has a red or yellow complexion, it should be taken more frequently.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Cautious Nurturing</strong></p>
<p>When a wet nurse carefully nurtures a child, she should breastfeed with moderation, wrap the child appropriately, ensure the child’s hunger and fullness are addressed, observe the child’s strength and weakness, adjust the thickness of nourishment, and respond to temperature changes. These practices are based on established principles that should not be overlooked. From birth until a month old, it is customary to administer a few drops of pig&#39;s milk into the infant&#39;s mouth. Additionally, take a large soybean&#39;s worth of powdered pearl, mix it with honey from a clam shell, and apply it to the child’s mouth in three or four doses, once every ten days or so. This calms the mind and stabilizes the spirit. During spring, infants should not have their heads and feet covered, as this would prevent the release of yang energy, leading to fever.</p>
<p><strong>On Dietary Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>There are certain foods that are unsuitable for young children; it is essential to be aware of these. Children should not eat too many chestnuts, as this weakens their qi and slows their movements; heated foods can cause qi stagnation. Children should not consume bracken fern, as it weakens their legs and prevents them from walking. They should not eat spiny water lily, as this hinders locomotion. Children should avoid millet, chicken, and cucumbers, as these can cause intestinal parasites. They should not eat pitcher plants, as this can lead to chronic ailments. Buckwheat should also be avoided, as it can cause hair loss. Children should not eat cocklebur, as it can result in pain during excretion. Lastly, they should not consume sturgeon, as this can induce disorders and obsessions.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

<p>In general, children should not eat excessively. If there is a heart ailment, they should avoid salty foods. If there is a lung condition, they should steer clear of bitter foods. If there is a liver issue, spicy foods should be avoided. If the spleen is unwell, sour and spoiled foods should be excluded. If there is kidney trouble, sweet drinks are to be avoided. Green onions and honey, when consumed together, are harmful. Amaranth and turtle meat, together, produce toxins. Oily fish and shrimp are to be avoided in the case of lung diseases. Raw cold eggs should not be eaten if there are spleen issues. Fried chicken and lamb are not suitable for heart ailments. Green onions, garlic, and oily noodles must be avoided for liver diseases. Kidneys, stomachs, and lung parts, regardless of whether one is ill or not, should not be eaten. Birds and sparrows can cause sores and scabs when consumed. Snails and crabs can lead to severe digestive issues. Eating sweet food leads to illness, and eating too much can exhaust energy. Cold food can cause stagnation, and sour food can damage willpower. Bitter food can drain energy, and salty food can cause difficulty in breathing. Fatty food generates phlegm, and spicy food harms the lungs. Lotus seeds and water caltrops can help invigorate heart energy; pomegranates and sour oranges can greatly harm the intestines and stomach. Dried persimmons boiled with sugar can still benefit the lungs. Steamed lotus root and fried beans are good for the liver. Five-flavor jujubes can please the spleen. A bland diet is beneficial for the organs and promotes clear energy. Parents who love and cherish their children must be aware of these prohibitions. If overlooked, diseases can arise innocently.

<p><strong>On the Birth of Infants</strong></p>
<p>When an infant is born, one should take a small amount of finely chopped licorice and steep it in boiling water to make a mild solution, not too sweet. Use soft cloth to dab the solution, cleaning the mouth to remove impurities. Next, take walnut meat, peel it, and chew it thoroughly; then wrap it in thin silk or gauze, forming it like a small date, and place it in the infant&#39;s mouth so that it can suck the juice. This not only harmonizes the stomach but also nourishes the organs—it is the best method. If the mother has a cold constitution and the infant is weak and clear, simply use a mild ginger tea to clean the mouth, which is most effective for removing stomach cold, clarifying the mind, and can also prevent vomiting and diarrhea. This method is excellent and not widely known. After cleaning, follow the walnut method as mentioned earlier. </p>
<p>Another method: take half a portion of cow bile, mix it with cinnabar, and adjust it with honey as before for sucking.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

<p>In ancient practices, there was much use of Huanglian, but it is important to note that Huanglian is extremely cold and bitter, and since young children have their primary energy in the stomach, how can they be expected to withstand the detrimental effects of such bitterness immediately after birth? This could damage their stomach qi, leading to vomiting or diarrhea in the future, which is certainly not advisable.</p>
<p>Another ancient method often employed was grinding cinnabar to open the mouth. In medical texts, it is noted that newborns should take cinnabar, light powder, white honey, and Huanglian to clear fetal toxins; however, these are all substances that harm the spleen and damage yang. The light powder causes phlegm that weakens the heart, and cinnabar damages the spirit by lowering saliva. Strong children may process these substances too easily, while weak ones are easily harmed, resulting in various diseases.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Navel Powder</strong></p>
<p>Ingredients: Clean ash from steamer, ash from unkempt hair, ash from white ginger, and ash from red silk, all in equal parts; South Star, White Lin, Angelica root (head), red beans, gallnut, blood-resin, dragon bone, burnt red stone resin, sea eagle, and herbal frost, each half a coin. Grind all to an extremely fine powder. For wet application, use it as a paste; for dry application, apply with clear oil. Avoid using raw water on the navel.</p>
<p>Another Formula: Ash from red cotton, ash from yellow cow dung, burnt dragon bone ground, ash from unkempt hair, and dry rouge, each half a coin. Grind into an extremely fine powder. For wet application, mix; for dry application, lubricate the navel with clear oil.</p>
<p>The Best Method for Preserving Life: This formula not only detoxifies but also nourishes. The navel is the source of life, related to the mother’s gate and the two kidneys’ dominion. By nourishing the kidneys, they become sufficient, thus preventing any interference. Thereby, no darkening of the navel occurs, nor are there any diseases related to disconnection.</p>
<p>Once the baby’s umbilical cord falls off, dry it on a new tile, and grind to powder with cinnabar, yellow baneberry, and licorice, each five parts. Mix and blend with honey, apply three to five times to the nursing mother’s milk. Wait for the baby to ingest it all within a day and night; subsequently, toxins will be expelled through bowel movements. In the future, not only will smallpox be less frequent, but there may be those who do not develop it at all. Wait until the umbilical cord falls off, and perform this procedure perfectly within six to seven days. The cinnabar must be ground into an extremely fine powder and passed through licorice soup. Safe for consumption without harm.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The First Recipe for Longevity</strong><br>In &quot;A Cure for All Diseases,&quot; this method is to be used for newborns, ensuring they never suffer from sores, rashes, or any illnesses throughout their lives. For every child born, one will benefit from this superb method. When the newborn’s umbilical cord falls off, place it on a new tile, surrounding it with charcoal fire until the smoke is nearly gone. Then, set it down, covering it with a tile, allowing it to retain its essence, and grind it into a fine powder. Use cinnabar that is transparent and prepare it into an extremely fine powder, passing it through water. </p>
<p>For the two ingredients mentioned, if the umbilical cord weighs five fen, use two fen and five li of cinnabar, along with a concentrated decoction of raw Rehmannia and Angelica. Mix these with a few shellfish, stir together the first two ingredients, and apply it to the child’s palate and the breastfeeding mother’s nipple, ensuring it is fully administered within one day until evening. The next day, there will be a bowel movement that expels impure wastes, thereby eliminating fetal toxins and ensuring no sores or rashes will occur. </p>
<p>These two formulas, as well as the detoxifying longevity ointment, share the common ingredient of the umbilical cord, but the preparation and accompanying medicinal ingredients vary in weight and importance.

<p>When a child is first born, it is advisable to give them fresh Rehmannia juice, a drop on the child’s mouth, which will induce black stools.

Use cotton to soak it and allow the child to suck on it; it’s best if they spit out the bad juice. If they consume one clam shell and do not spit, they do not need to take more. This is necessary for infants regardless of their constitution or whether they are cold or hot. 【From the &#39;Elbow Back Formula&#39;】<br><strong>Huanglian Method</strong>: For a newborn, if the bad juice remains in the chest and is obstructed, it can easily lead to heat accumulation and convulsions. Use several good blocks of fatty Huanglian (Coptis), crush them and wrap them in cotton to form a size about that of a nipple. Soak it in water to extract yellow juice, take one or two drops, and place it in the child’s mouth; the bad juice will naturally flow out, and their breastfeeding will improve. Any remaining should be soaked in cotton separately, and later give it with red honey intermittently. 【From the &#39;Collection of Verified Formulas&#39;】<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Medical Case</strong>: </p>
<p>In the &quot;Complete Book of Jingyue,&quot; it is noted: My younger child was born in the Ding-si year, at the Yan estate, around the time of the White Dew festival, just over half a cycle of the moon. I noticed the new cool days ahead, and worried that the thin bedding might expose the child to cold air, sternly advising the caretakers to keep the child warm, but they did not take it seriously. A few days later, the child indeed began to have severe vomiting and diarrhea. I first used warming and spleen-harmonizing medicines, but to no avail. I then tried regulating formulas, yet they also did not work. After three days, I added three qian of ginseng, along with ginger, cassia, wuzhu, and nutmeg, still without effect. By the fourth day, the child was vomiting and diarrhea simultaneously, expelling half of what was consumed, with nothing retained in the belly. I had no choice but to use five or six qian of ginseng, along with one or two qian of aconite, ginger, cassia, etc. But even upon swallowing, the child would immediately vomit, leaving not a drop behind, and the milk expelled was clean and untainted, resembling milk still. At that time, the signs of danger in the child&#39;s condition were exceedingly grave, with no chance of recovery left.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I sat quietly, reflecting on the cause of the issue, considering that the cold energy was affecting the stomach, leading to endless vomiting and diarrhea. If I were to abandon herbs like ginseng, ginger, cinnamon, and aconite, what other methods could there be? The situation became dire. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I had a thought: the stomach&#39;s deficiency had reached its limit, and if the medicine’s flavor was even slightly incompatible, the stomach would reject it. Moreover, since aconite has a salty flavor, it can also induce vomiting; this must be a contributing factor. </p>
<p>So I assessed the flavors and determined it was necessary to use a sweet and spicy remedy, as this would likely soothe the stomach energy and maintain vitality. I decided to use three qian of pepper, crushed, along with one liang of ginger, boiled in two zhongs of water until reduced by a third, and set aside for use. I also took two liang of ginseng, boiled in another two zhongs of water until reduced to one zhong, and set that aside as well. </p>
<p>With these two components, I aimed for a balanced flavor profile that was sweet and spicy. I combined the two, adjusting their taste with a teaspoon. For every ten doses of ginseng broth, I added one dose of the pepper and ginger broth, creating a mildly sweet and spicy flavor that was truly palatable.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

The family members complained, saying that with such tender bowels as a baby, how could he endure such hot medicine? It would definitely burn his intestines. They all wept together. Although I doubted, I did not panic, but still focused and thought deeply, considering that from the fourth watch until now, if the medicine was difficult to endure, why was he fine before noon and suddenly changed like this? It must be that after several days without food, his stomach was freshly restored, and with an empty belly, he would feel quite hungry. Nearby, there was some prepared porridge, and when I offered it to him, he became anxious and eagerly wanted it. He quickly gulped it down and looked for more.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The next day, I added more prescriptions, and only then did he begin to improve and fully recover. Alas! The rebirth of this child is indeed due to fate, but when considering the causes, it is evident that the internal heat of a person&#39;s organs is linked to the back. When the mattress is thin and the nights are cold, the chill enters through the back, deeply affecting the internal organs. The treatment method, although the medication is appropriate, lacks the proper essence and flavor to integrate; thus, seeking relief becomes difficult. </p>
<p>Additionally, when hunger causes restlessness, if the spirit does not recognize its condition, and one carelessly uses cooling remedies to resolve it, then all efforts may be in vain, causing further harm! Therefore, I write this to highlight the severity of the illness, the relationship of essences and flavors, and the dynamic nature of diagnosis and treatment. Although this is specific to my own child, it underscores the confidence in healing. </p>
<p>If another’s child suffers similarly and the prescribed treatments do not yield results, one might assume the medicine is misapplied and hastily criticize the treatment, switching to harsh, cold remedies, which could be fatal. Yet the blame would still fall on the use of ginseng. At such a time, how can one distinguish right from wrong?
