      <div><p><strong>Ancient and Modern Compendium of Books, Complete Collection of Medicine, Volume 214</strong></p>
<p><strong>Muscle Gate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Classic of Simple Questions</strong></p>
<p>In a woman at the age of four seven, her muscles and bones are strong, her hair is long to the extreme, and her body is robust.  <em>[Note: A woman at the age of four seven is at the peak of her essence and blood, hence her muscles and bones are strong and her hair is extremely long. Abundant blood and qi fill the skin and flesh, thus her body is robust.]</em> </p>
<p>A man at the age of three eight has balanced kidney energy, strong muscles and bones, thus his true teeth develop and grow to the extreme. <em>[Note: A man at the age of three eight has his true teeth and muscles and bones reach their full growth.]</em> </p>
<p>By seven eight, liver energy declines, muscles can no longer move, the heavenly dew is depleted, essence is scant, the kidneys weaken, and the body reaches its limit. <em>[Note: The liver is generated from the kidney; as kidney energy declines, it gradually affects the liver. The liver governs the muscles; with declining liver energy, the muscles cannot move. The kidneys govern the bones; with both muscles and bones weakening, the body becomes fatigued.]</em><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Vital Energy and Its Connection to Illness</strong></p>
<p>Due to dampness, the head feels wrapped. When damp heat does not dissipate, the large tendons become short and constricted, while the small tendons become loose and elongated; the shortness leads to spasm, while the looseness results in atrophy. </p>
<p><em>Note: The evil of yin-dampness affects the yang aspect and obstructs the bright light, hence the feeling of the head being wrapped. Dampness injures yang energy, leading to the transformation into heat. Yang energy nourishes the tendons when it is gentle; when yang is damaged and cannot nourish the tendons, the large tendons become short and constricted, while the small tendons become loose and elongated. The large tendons connect within the joints, thus they shorten due to accumulated heat. The small tendons are connected outside the bones and flesh, thus they become loose due to dampness. Shortness leads to sudden contraction and spasms, while length leads to excessive relaxation and atrophy.</em></p>
<p>The essence of yang energy is such that great anger causes the vital essence to become depleted and the blood to stagnate upwards, leading to feelings of faintness and injury to the tendons, which may cause them to not be able to bear weight.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>When great anger arises, the yang energy reverses upward, disrupting the movement of energy within the body. Blood, following this energy, rises and both qi and blood flow upward, leading one to experience faintness. The blood vessels nourish muscles and bones and benefit the joints; when yang energy is injured and blood flows backward, it harms the muscles and bones. When the muscles are injured and slackened, the limbs feel as if they cannot be freely used. </p>
<p>Excessively spicy flavors weaken the muscles and tendons, leading to a lack of spirit. Therefore, it is important to harmonize the five flavors, ensuring bones are aligned and muscles are supple, allowing qi and blood to flow and the pores to be tight. In this way, the essence of bone qi becomes refined, adherence to the proper method ensures longevity and aligns with the mandate of heaven.</p>
<p>When the metal energy is overly strong, it injures the liver energy, resulting in slackened muscles and tendons. The kidneys store essence and govern the bones, while the liver stores blood and regulates the tendons. Wind invading with excessive energy injures the liver, leading to the loss of essence. Thus, harmonizing the five flavors ensures bones are aligned, muscles are pliable, and pores are tightly closed.</p>
<p>Therefore, those skilled in healing first treat the skin and hair, then the muscles and flesh, next the tendons and vessels, after that the six hollow organs, and finally the five viscera. Treating the five viscera involves a state of half-life and half-death. </p>
<p>When pathogens invade the interior and do not resolve through the hollow organs, they affect the viscera. If the pathogens are within the qi channels of the five viscera, there is still a chance for recovery and life; but if they affect the viscera, it leads to death. Thus, it is said to be half-life and half-death.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on the Six Organs and Their Manifestations</h3>
<p>The liver is the foundation of the ultimate relaxation and the dwelling of the soul. Its manifestation is in the nails, and its substance resides in the tendons, giving rise to blood and qi. Its taste is sour, and its color is green; this represents the lesser yang within yang, connecting with the energy of spring. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The nails are the remnants of the tendons, hence their manifestation is in the nails while their substance is in the tendons.</p>
<h3>Treatise on the Generation of the Five Organs</h3>
<p>The liver correlates with the tendons; its glory is the nails; it primarily governs the lungs. Excessive consumption of pungent food leads to taut tendons and withered nails. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pungent refers to a metal flavor, and overindulgence harms the liver, leading to contracted tendons and withered nails. All tendons belong to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tendons arise from the bones, connected between the joints.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Fundamental Essence of Pulses</h3>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What is the cause of abscesses, muscle cramps, and bone pain?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;These are swellings caused by cold qi and changes due to the eight winds.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This refers to the evils of wind and cold during the four seasons, transforming into heat diseases such as abscesses and cramps.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Human Vitality</h3>
<p>The true essence of the organs disperses within the liver; the liver stores the qi of the tendons.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p>The true essence of the organ is the spirit it houses. The spirit resides in the organ as the liver, and in the body as the tendons, indicating that the true spirit of the organ disperses in the liver and governs the energy that stores in the tendons. </p>
<p>Wind is the chief of all diseases. The kidneys communicate with the heart, leading to ailments that affect the tendons and vessels, known as &quot;spasm.&quot; At this time, both moxibustion and medicine can be used. If left untreated for ten days, death is inevitable. </p>
<p>The heart governs the blood vessels and is associated with fire; when the fire is overly intense, the tendons and vessels become dry and constricted, leading to stiffness in the hands and feet. In cases of acute danger, moxibustion and medicine can still be employed, meaning one should not abandon treatment due to severity. If untreated for ten days, death is likely. </p>
<p>When food energy enters the stomach, it spreads essence to the liver and moist energy to the tendons.</p>
<p>Sour flavors affect the tendons, and one suffering from tendon disease should avoid consuming too much sour food. </p>
<p>The liver is related to the tendons; prolonged activity can harm the tendons. </p>
<p>Basic suffering results in joy, with conditions arising in the tendons, which should be treated with pressing and guiding methods. When physical labor exhausts the body, it injures the tendons; if one&#39;s aspirations are relaxed but the blood vessels are not ill, then treatment through pressing and guiding is employed to nourish the tendons and achieve stability.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Qi Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>The spleen transfers cold to the liver, causing abscesses and muscle spasms.<br>[Note: The liver governs blood; cold causes blood to coagulate. The Classic states: When the nourishing qi cannot circulate, it causes abscesses. The liver governs muscles, hence the spasms.]</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Bi Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>The combination of wind, cold, and dampness creates Bi syndrome. In spring, those who encounter this suffer from muscle obstruction, and if it persists, they may be further affected by evils that reside within the liver. The Emperor said: In cases of Bi, some die, while others experience prolonged pain, and some recover easily. What is the reason for this? Qi Bo answered: Those who suffer deep internal injury die; those who linger between the muscles and bones experience prolonged pain; those who remain in the skin recover easily.<br>[Note: The evils become lodged in the organs when the organ qi is sufficiently strong, preventing them from moving. If the spirit qi dissipates, then the evil converges in the organs and causes death. Those who linger between muscles and bones without settling deeper experience prolonged pain; those remaining in the skin disperse easily with the qi.]</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Why is it that Bi syndrome does not cause pain? Qi Bo replied: When it is in the bones, it feels heavy; in the vessels, blood congeals and does not flow; in the muscles, it cannot bend or stretch; in the flesh, it loses sensitivity; in the skin, it causes coldness. Therefore, when these five conditions are present, there is no pain.<br>[Note: If the disease manifests in form without harming the qi, one may observe the heaviness of bone obstruction, the stagnation of blood in the vessels, the inability to bend and stretch in the muscles, the insensitivity in the flesh, and the cold in the skin, thereby presenting these five clinical signs without pain.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Weakness</strong> </p>
<p>When liver qi is hot, bile leaks, leading to a bitter taste in the mouth and the drying of the fascia. When the fascia dries, the muscles become tight and cramp, resulting in muscle weakness. </p>
<p>[Note: The gallbladder is an organ that holds essential fluids and corresponds to the muscles, which are the fascia throughout the body, nourished by the vital juices from the organs. The gallbladder is attached to the liver; when liver qi is hot, bile leaks, causing bitterness in the mouth. When bile leaks, the fascia cannot be nourished and dries up; when the fascia is dry, it becomes tight and cramp results in muscle weakness.] </p>
<p>Endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires lead to indulgence in external fantasies, overindulging in sexual activity causes the foundational muscles to loosen, resulting in muscle weakness and even seminal emission. Thus, muscle weakness originates from the liver, manifesting internally. </p>
<p>[Note: Endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires damage liver qi. The perineum is where the foundational muscles gather; indulging in external fantasies stirs internal desire-fire. Overindulging leads to relaxation of the foundational muscles, resulting in impotence and seminal emission.]<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Strange Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: When a person has a pulse that is excessively wide, with tense muscles appearing, what kind of illness is this? Qibo replied: This is called &quot;tendon rash.&quot; Such a person will have a tense abdomen, and if there are signs of white or black, the illness is severe. </p>
<p>[Note: The chong pulse governs the permeation of streams and valleys and connects with the yangming channel, which is why muscle disease corresponds with abdominal tension. Among the twelve channels, only when the hand taiyin is severely affected does it lead to convulsions, a tight abdomen, and vomiting blood. If the foot shaoyin&#39;s muscle disease is severe, it will result in death without treatment. Therefore, seeing signs of white or black indicates a severe illness.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Major Oddities</strong></p>
<p>When the heart pulse is full and large, and there are convulsions and muscle spasms; when the liver pulse is small and tense, there are also convulsions and muscle spasms. </p>
<p>[Note: The heart is a fire organ; when the fire heat is excessive, the pulse becomes large and convulsions occur. The liver governs muscles and blood; when small, it indicates deficiency, and when tense, it suggests coldness. Thus, a deficiency of the liver leads to coldness that fails to nourish the muscles, resulting in spasms and convulsions.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Skin and Surface</strong></p>
<p>When pathogens invade the channels, they create a sensation of deficiency that leads to sinking. If they linger between the muscles and bones, an excess of cold will cause muscle spasms and bone pain; an excess of heat will cause muscles to relax and bones to weaken, flesh to rot and break down, and hair to become straight and fall out. </p>
<p>[Note: When pathogens linger between the muscles and bones, it results in muscle spasms and bone pain, flesh rotting and breaking down, and hair falling out and deteriorating.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Qi and Cavities</strong></p>
<p>Accumulated cold lingers in the dwelling, the nourishing and protective energies cannot reside; muscles contract and tendons shrink, the ribs and elbows cannot extend, resulting in internal bone stiffness and external numbness, termed &quot;insufficiency.&quot; This is due to the great cold flowing in the valleys. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Accumulated cold lingers, preventing the nourishing and protective energies from cohabiting; cold evils stagnate and do not receive the righteous qi to harmonize, causing the flesh to roll and muscles to contract. The ribs and elbows are the joints of muscles and bones, hence they cannot stretch; evils are closed off outside, resulting in internal bone stiffness; the internal nourishing and protective energies are inverted, leading to external numbness, termed &quot;insufficiency.&quot; The excess of hot evils is categorized as surplus, while the cold nature is dense and stagnant, thus leading to insufficiency. This great cold evil flows in the valleys, causing illnesses in the muscles and bones.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Reversal of the Four Seasonal Treatments</strong></p>
<p>When Shaoyang is in excess, it leads to muscle stiffness and fullness in the flanks; when there is insufficiency, it leads to liver stiffness. If slippery, it causes liver wind hernia; if stagnant, it causes accumulation with tense muscles and eye ailments. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pulse and qi are dispersed in the skin and hair, again relying on the flesh governed by Taiyin, the tendons governed by Shaoyang, and the bones governed by Taiyang, connecting internally to the five organs. Thus, when there is excess outside, it results in muscle stiffness, tendon stiffness, and bone stiffness; when insufficient and trapped internally, it leads to spleen stiffness, liver stiffness, and kidney stiffness. When qi is excessive internally and transforms into heat, it leads to hernia; when blood is excessive internally and transforms into cold, it leads to accumulation.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p>
<h3>On the Great Theory of Qi Transformation</h3>
<p>When the water of the year recurs, both sinews and bones become disturbed, and the flesh trembles; vision becomes unclear, and objects appear vague. The muscles and flesh are agitated, qi gathers in the diaphragm, causing pain in the heart and abdomen, and the yellow qi is depleted. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Yangming governs the moistening of the sinews, and all sinews belong to the bones. Yangming&#39;s central earth qi is damaging, hence both sinews and bones are disturbed. &quot;Trembling&quot; refers to sudden movements. The unclear vision is due to wind overpowering and injuring the blood.]</strong></p>
<h3>On the Great Theory of the Five Constants</h3>
<p>Yangming governs the heavens; side pain, red eyes, trembling, and inability to stand for long all arise from the illness of the liver wood. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Side pain and red eyes, along with trembling and weakness in the sinews, are all illnesses related to the liver.]</strong> </p>
<p>Taiyang governs the heavens; internal accumulation of water and drink leads to fullness and inability to eat, causing skin and flesh to be harsh, and the meridians to be obstructed; in severe cases, there may be swelling and sores on the back. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Internal fullness from water and drink, along with harsh skin and flesh, are all illnesses caused by dampness. Sores on the back refer to pus forming there.]</strong><a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on True Fundamentals</strong></p>
<p>The Yangming governs the heavens, dryness and indulgence triumph, leading to internal changes in muscles and bones.<br>(Note: Yangming governs the heavens, in the years of the Rabbit and Rooster. The victory of dryness over metal injures the liver&#39;s blood, hindering its nourishment of muscles and bones, thus causing internal changes.) </p>
<p>When the sun&#39;s influence prevails, the muscles and flesh become tight and constricted, blood vessels are blocked, leading to color changes.<br>(Note: The foot Taiyang governs the muscles, hence the tightness of muscles and flesh. Blocked blood vessels and color changes may indicate blood leakage and evil entering the channels.)</p>
<p>When Yangming is restored, pure qi rises significantly, potentially entering the liver, leading to cramps and spasms in the muscles. If the Tai Chong (a pulse) is blocked, it results in death without treatment.<br>(Note: The restoration of Yangming begins at its proper time, hence the significant rise of pure qi. If pure qi enters the liver, it affects the organ, which is in a state of half-life and half-death; if the evil is feeble, but the organ is truly unharmed, one survives. However, if the Tai Chong pulse is blocked, the true essence is harmed.)</p>
<p>The Shaoyang governs the heavens; when guests are dominant, it leads to outbreaks of red sores, nausea, throat obstruction, headaches, swollen throats, deafness, and internal heat anxiety.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The lesser yang rules the heavens; the initial energy consists of the three energies, which govern the two types of fire. The energy of the second corresponds to the damp earth of the greater yin. Red rashes refer to spots caused by heat from fire manifesting externally. The red patches indicate a desire to move internally after appearing outside. Nausea and convulsive symptoms arise from the internal energy of damp earth. Sores and swellings, along with various other symptoms, also arise from the influences of damp heat, as they move from above downwards and from the outside inwards.</p>
<p>In the case of the jué yīn at the spring, when the external energy is excessive, the major joints become restricted; internally, there are convulsions and stiffness, while externally there is discomfort. When the external energy is in control, it results in tightness and pain in the muscles and bones. </p>
<p>The major joints refer to the twelve joints of hands and feet. The jué yīn at the spring, influenced by external energies, is first affected by the dry metal of the yang ming, while the jué yīn governs the tendons, and dryness affects joint mobility. Then, the external energy is influenced by the cold water of the tai yang. The tai yang is the chief energy of all yangs, and the softness of yang nourishes tendons; however, if cold energy infiltrates internally, it affects the tai yang, leading to internal convulsions and stiffness, known as the &quot;痓&quot; syndrome.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Excesses</strong></p>
<p>There are three constants in diagnosis: one must inquire about wealth and poverty, whether one was rich before and became poor later. Although it does not harm the external factors, it causes the skin to burn and the tendons to contract, leading to atrophy and stiffness.</p>
<p>(Note: When one becomes rich first and then poor, it injures one’s will and spirit. The will and spirit are what govern one’s mental state, regulate emotions, and adjust to cold, warmth, joy, and anger. Therefore, if one’s glory and honor stabilize the will and spirit, then the muscles and bones will be strong, and the pores will be firm. If the will and spirit are injured, then the精神 cannot be contained within, resulting in diseases such as muscle and bone stiffness.)</p>
<p>Experiencing great harm from previous wealth can sever tendons and disrupt channels, causing the body to deteriorate. Currently, the moisture does not cease, leading to injuries and blockages, retaining thinness while returning to Yang, resulting in the accumulation of pus and cold heat. If improperly treated, it may lead to urgent needling of Yin and Yang, causing the body to dissolve, limbs to cramp, with death expected to occur within a certain time.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Here is the translated text:</p>
<p>If one is once wealthy but suddenly loses all resources, it greatly harms their spirit and soul. Therefore, the heart governs the vessels, and the liver governs the tendons; it is as if they have been severed, which injures the blood vessels of the left side. However, the spleen on the right side remains uninjured, allowing the body still to function. The vital energy governed by the lungs and kidneys has not been harmed, thus it continues to grow without ceasing. Though the illness initially arises from the yin, over time it will also affect the yang. This results in the blood of the heart and liver being harmed while accumulating in the left, leaving it thin within the qi division and returning to the yang. Both the blood and qi on the left and right are harmed, leading to the accumulation of pus and cold heat. The injury to the yin results in the thinning of the yang, which causes pus to accumulate between yin and yang, cold and heat. When both yin and yang blood and qi are harmed, if one tonifies yang, the yin will deplete; if one purges yin, the yang will be lost. In such cases, one may only drink sweet medicines and should not use moxibustion or acupuncture. If a rough practitioner, lacking knowledge, hastily needles the yin and yang, it results in the dissolution of the body, injuring the splenic qi, and causing the limbs to cramp, which leads to the exhaustion of gastric qi.</p>
<p>In cases of acute heart vessel issues, one experiences convulsions. The heart is the fire organ, thus when it is severely cold, convulsions occur. The joints of the hands and feet are where the spirit and qi move in and out; cold injures the spirit and qi, therefore resulting in convulsions. When the liver pulse is weak and lingering, it leads to convulsions and muscle rigidity. This occurs due to deficiency of liver qi accompanied by cold, as the liver governs the tendons. When the spleen pulse is acute, it also results in convulsions.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Notes:</strong> When the sudden contraction occurs, it causes urgency; when there is relaxation, it leads to looseness. The spleen governs the limbs, hence urgency is associated with sudden contractions.</p>
<p><strong>Main Body of the Text</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Spirit:</strong> When the liver feels sorrow and is stirred, it harms the soul. If the soul is harmed, one becomes mad, forgetting and lacking focus; without focus, there is disorder. This leads to the body becoming contracted and muscles rigid, the ribs unable to lift, hair becoming withered, and complexion fading, resulting in death during autumn. <strong>Notes:</strong> Sorrow is an emotion of the lungs. If the liver becomes agitated by sorrow, it harms the soul stored in the liver. When the soul is harmed, one becomes mad and forgets. The liver governs the muscles, and if emotions harm the body, this results in physical symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>On the Meridians:</strong> When the Qi of the foot&#39;s Jueyin is severed, the muscles become disconnected. The Jueyin refers to the liver meridian; the liver is the source of the muscles. Muscles converge at the reproductive organs and extend to the root of the tongue. Therefore, if the pulse is not nourished, muscles become tense; if tense, they affect the tongue and the reproductive organs, leading to blue lips and a rolled tongue. If the reproductive organs shrink, the muscles die first, leading to a decline in the metal (lungs) and death of the wood (liver) as metal surpasses wood. <strong>Notes:</strong> The Qi of the foot&#39;s Jueyin governs the muscles, hence if the Qi is severed, the muscles also become disconnected. The Jueyin refers to the liver meridian, which governs the muscles, representing the connection between the Qi of the meridian and the liver. The convergence at the reproductive organs signifies the gathering of muscle energy, with connections extending to the tongue. If the pulse is not nourishing the muscles, they become tense, rolling the tongue and shrinking the reproductive organs. When the Qi of the Jueyin is severed, the muscles die first, the metal&#39;s decline leading to the death of wood, resulting in the exhaustion of the liver&#39;s wood Qi.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>The muscle of the Taiyang channel of the foot begins at the little toe, connects at the ankle, and merges at the knee; below, it follows the outer side of the foot, connects at the heel, and ascends along the arch to the popliteal area. Its branches connect at the outer side of the calf, then from the inner side of the popliteal region, up to the hip, and flank the spine along the back of the head. One branch connects at the base of the tongue; another connects at the occiput and links the higher portions to the face, connecting at the nose; yet another branch extends to the area beneath the jaw. Another branch runs from behind the armpit to the shoulder joint; another branch enters under the armpit, goes up through the axilla, and connects at the clavicle; a branch extends out of the axilla and exits at the jaw. </p>
<p>Conditions related to this channel manifest as pain and swelling in the little toe, cramping in the knee, stiffness in the back, tightness in the neck, inability to lift the shoulder, and pain in the axillary area within the axilla, making it difficult to sway left or right. Treatment involves burning needles for acupuncture, focusing on the areas where pain is felt, and using specific acupressure points known as &quot;zhongchun bi&quot; (mid-spring obstruction). </p>
<p>The &quot;burning needle&quot; technique is akin to seizing and thrusting the needle without following the natural flow of entry and exit. &quot;Knowing&quot; refers to the harmonious flow of blood and qi, allowing for proper movement. Choosing points based on pain is about targeting acupoints directly associated with the area of pain. The outer surface (skin) is considered yang, while muscles and bones are yin; when there is a blockage in the yin, it is termed obstruction, where blood and qi are stagnant and cause pain. The month of February corresponds to the left foot&#39;s Taiyang channel, hence the name &quot;mid-spring obstruction.&quot; The muscles of the hands and feet relate to the four seasons and the twelve months of the year; therefore, diseases also arise according to the seasons and are not merely due to external factors.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The lesser yang of the foot originates from the second toe, ascending to the outer ankle, following the outer edge of the shin, and culminating at the outer side of the knee. Its branch arises from the outer fibula, running up to the hip; the front branch connects above the knee, while the rear branch connects to the buttock. The main channel ascends along the lower ribs, traverses the front of the armpit, and connects at the chest and breast, terminating at the clavicle. It directly exits the armpit, passes through the clavicle, emerges in front of the temple, follows along the back of the ear to the forehead, converging at the crown, and descends to the jaw, ultimately connecting at the chin. Its branch connects at the outer canthus of the eye, forming the outer sinews. The ailments include pain in the second and little toes that radiates to the knee, preventing flexion and extension; the hamstring becomes tight. It causes pain in the hip anteriorly and in the buttock posteriorly, leading to pain along the lower ribs and a tight sensation in the chest and neck muscles.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>From the left to the right, the right eye does not open. After passing the right corner, the channels are meandering. The left connects to the right, thus injuring the left corner. The right foot is unusable, which is called the crossing of the sinews. The treatment involves burning needles and employing sharp pricks, using knowledge as measure and pain as index, which is referred to as the paralysis of early spring. </p>
<p>(Note: The term &quot;crossing of the sinews&quot; refers to the intersection of the connective tissues from left and right. The connection from the left to the right results in injury on the left side, indicating that the disease progresses from left to right. The incapacitation of the right foot originates from the top down, illustrating that the sinews are a foundational framework of the body, connecting from left to right and from above to below. This condition pertains to the lesser yang sinews of the foot, intersecting with the yang sinews and causing disease. &quot;Yin&quot; signifies the birth of yang in the first month, which governs the lesser yang of the left foot, hence it is termed the paralysis of early spring.) </p>
<p>The sinew of the foot&#39;s yangming begins at the middle three toes, connects at the tarsal area, and then the evil influence from above attaches to the auxiliary bone. It ascends along the outer knee and directly rises to the hip joint, following along the sides adhering to the spine; it continues upwards along the leg, reaching the outer knee. The original text has a deficiency here.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>In the &quot;Ling Shu,&quot; the meridians are also lacking, supplemented by the &quot;Tai Su&quot;; their branches connect to the outer auxiliary bones, corresponding to Shao Yang. The direct ones ascend along the伏兔, connecting at the hip, gathering in the lower organs, rising through the abdomen and spreading, reaching the pubic region and connecting, ascending the neck, linking to the mouth, and uniting at the jaw, with a lower connection to the nose, and an upper association with the Tai Yang. Tai Yang governs the net above the eyes, while Yang Ming governs the net below the eyes. The branches connect from the cheek to the front of the ear. </p>
<p>If there are illnesses affecting the middle toe with cramping in the shin, significant jumping in the foot, cramping at the伏兔, swelling in the front of the hips, urgent strains pulling the abdomen, and cheek, sudden mouth deviation, with urgency causing the eyes to close, heat leading to looser muscles preventing eye opening, and cold causing tightness in the cheek resulting in mouth deviation; if heat is present, the muscles become relaxed and slack, unable to be controlled, hence the deviation. Treat this with horse salve for the urgent areas; mix white wine with cinnamon to apply to the slack areas; use a mulberry hook to address it, placing raw mulberry charcoal in a basin, adjusting up and down while sitting, applying salve to the urgent cheek. Additionally, drink fine wine, enjoy delectable grilled food; for those who do not drink, they should strengthen themselves by merely three pats. Treatment involves burning needles and piercing, knowing the counts and using pain as a guide, referred to as &quot;Springtime Bi.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Note: Tai Yang cold water controls Qi and thus opens; hence, when cold, the muscles tighten resulting in the eyes not aligning. Yang Ming, being hot and dry, controls Qi and causes closure, thus when hot, the muscles relax preventing the eyes from opening. Cold in the cheek leads to tightness pulling the cheek and causing deviation, while heat causes relaxation and inability to gather, leading to deviation, whereby tightness in the left side results in left deviation, while looseness on the right side leads to right deviation.</em><a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>To prepare the ointment, render horse fat into a balm, and for the mulberry, use its twisted branches to support it. Ensure the heights are equal like a seat. Then, place fresh mulberry charcoal in a pit to sit on. If the left jaw muscle is tense and the mouth is deviated to the left, use white wine mixed with cinnamon to apply to the relaxed right jaw. Use the horse fat to soothe the tense left jaw, alternating between the tightness and relaxation on both sides. Also, drink fine wine and eat roasted delicacies; if someone abstains from wine, encourage them to drink it. Perform three pats and cease, as this is the method to treat the crooked jaw. For symptoms like cramps and hernias, treatment involves cauterizing with a needle to pinpoint pain. The third month corresponds to the left foot&#39;s Yangming, hence it causes spring dampness. When in the Yangming area, drinking fine wine and eating delicacies allows all tendons to be nourished by the fluids of the stomach, which is why Yangming governs the moistening of the primary tendons, and the primary tendons support the bones and facilitate movement.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The muscle of the Foot Taiyin originates from the inner side of the big toe and ascends to join at the inner ankle. Its straight pathway connects to the inner knee bone, follows along the inner thigh, culminates at the hip, gathers at the genitals, ascends in the abdomen to the navel, connects within the abdomen to the ribs, and disperses in the chest. The internal pathway attaches to the spine. The symptoms of this affliction include pain in the inner ankle and big toe, cramping pain, pain in the inner knee bone, pulling pain in the inner thigh to the hip, pain at the genitals, pain radiating to the navel and both sides, and pain in the chest and internal spine. Treatment involves burning needles and stabbing at specific points, guided by knowledge of the count and location of pain; this condition is called &quot;obstruction of early autumn.&quot; </p>
<p>The muscle of the Foot Shaoyin starts beneath the little toe, follows alongside the Foot Taiyin muscle, the pathogen travels beneath the inner ankle, connects to the heel, unites with the Yang muscle, and then ascends beneath the inner knee joint, following the inner thigh to the genitals. It runs along the inner spine, alongside the lumbar region, up to the neck, connects at the occipital bone, and merges with the Yang muscle of the foot. The symptoms include cramping in the lower part of the foot, and all areas it traverses may experience pain or cramping. Those affected externally cannot bend forward, while internal afflictions hinder upward movement. Therefore, for yang diseases, the waist is bent backward and one cannot bend forward; for yin diseases, one cannot lean back.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>The treatment is to apply cauterization with burning needles, discerning by knowledge and inflicting pain to find the acupoints. For internal issues, one should utilize soothing drinks and medicinal herbs. If a tendon is severely twisted and broken, and the frequency of spasms is high, it leads to death if untreated, known as the &quot;Middle Autumn Bi&quot; (a condition). </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;Middle&quot; should be &quot;Meng&quot; in this context.) </p>
<p>The notes clarify that both external and internal conditions relate to the effects of Yin and Yang. Above the Lesser Yin, the Lord Fire is dominant, while the Lesser Yin governs the control of Yin and Yang, with evidence of external and internal influences. The Yang is external, and Yin is internal. Twisting and breaking refer to strong convulsions or spasms. If the spasms are frequent and intense, it leads to death if untreated. The Lesser Yin governs the storage of body fluids, nourishing tendons and bones, and facilitating joints. Yang energy, when gentle, nurtures tendons; however, frequent twisting or severe pain indicates a depletion of pure Yang energy. &quot;Shen&quot; refers to the birth of Yin occurring in the seventh month, governing the Lesser Yin of the left foot, thus identifying it as the Bi of Meng Autumn.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>The sinew of the foot’s jueyin starts at the tip of the big toe, connects in front of the inner ankle, ascends along the shins, connects beneath the inner thigh, and ascends through the inner thigh, terminating at the genitals, intertwining with various sinews. Its affliction manifests as pain in the big toe, in front of the inner ankle, and inner thigh, as well as cramping of the genitals, which may become unusable: if injured internally, movement ceases; if harmed by cold, the yin retracts; if affected by heat, it extends and fails to retract. Treatment involves moving water to clear yin energy. For cramping, the method is to use burning needles for piercing, measuring by sensation and pain. This is referred to as &quot;autumnal obstruction.&quot;</p>
<p>Note: The energy of metal resides below, and is addressed with the energy of water; taking another step invokes wood energy. The wood energy of jueyin originates from water, hence the treatment involves moving water to clarify jueyin energy. The condition manifests in the tangible sinews, and for cramping, the treatment involves the use of burning needles for piercing.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The muscle of the Hand-Sun meridian begins above the little finger and connects at the wrist, following along the inner side of the arm to conclude behind the sharp bone at the elbow. It then rebounds to respond at the upper part of the little finger and connects at the armpit. Its branch runs behind the armpit, around the shoulder blade, follows the neck, and exits in front of the temple, connecting behind the ear at the “Wān” bone. Another branch enters the ear, while the main pathway exits above the ear and descends to connect at the jaw above the outer canthus of the eye. </p>
<p>The condition associated with this pathway results in pain in the inner area behind the elbow connected to the little finger, leading to pain in the arm, the armpit, the area behind the armpit, and around the shoulder blade, causing pain that travels to the neck. Patients may experience a ringing in the ear, pain radiating to the jaw, and difficulty seeing until some time has passed; if the neck muscles become tight, it may lead to muscular atrophy or swelling in the neck, influenced by cold or heat. The treatment involves using moxibustion and needling, focusing on areas of pain and swelling, as well as employing methods to draw out and sharpen the pathological condition.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>The main branch of this meridian curves upwards, runs along the front of the ear, connects to the outer canthus of the eye, and ascends to the jaw, where it binds at the angle. Its affliction is referred to as a disease. In the &quot;Lingshu&quot; it is written as &quot;its pain,&quot; while in the &quot;Tai Su&quot; it is written as &quot;its disease.&quot; The areas it traverses represent branches of the sinews. Treatment involves burning needles and piercing them, using sensation as a guide, and pain as an indicator, referred to as the &quot;Midsummer Bloc.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: The main branch of this meridian originates from the straight one and diverges. Both the main and collateral sinews belong to the outer canthus sinew system and are interconnected. The time designated as noon is May, which governs the hand&#39;s sun, hence it is named the Midsummer Bloc.)</p>
<p>The sinew of the Hand Shaoyang begins at the tips of the little and ring fingers, connects at the wrist, ascends along the arm, binds at the elbow, wraps around the outer aspect of the upper arm, ascends to the shoulder and runs to the neck, merging with the Hand Taiyang. Its branch also enters the cheek to connect with the root of the tongue. Another branch curves upwards through the front of the ear, reaches the outer canthus, and ascends to the jaw where it binds at the angle. Its disease affects the areas it traverses, indicating a branch of the sinew, and causes the tongue to roll. Treatment involves burning needles and piercing them, using sensation as a guide, and pain as an indicator, referred to as the &quot;Late Summer Bloc.&quot;<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The &quot;Season of Minor Summer&quot; occurs in June, marked by the energy of the less yang. This is why it is referred to as &quot;Minor Summer Blockage.&quot;</p>
<p>The muscle of the yangming channel in the hand originates at the tips of the thumb and index finger, converging at the wrist, running up the arm and meeting at the outer elbow, continuing to the upper arm, and connecting at the shoulder. Its branch encircles the shoulder blade and hugs the spine; the straight pathway moves from the shoulder to the nape of the neck. Another branch goes up to the cheek and connects at the jaw. The straight line extends outward in front of the hand, going from the left angle along the head down to the right jaw.</p>
<p>The afflictions manifest as pain in the areas traversed or cramps, causing the shoulder to be immobile and the neck unable to turn left or right. Treatment involves burning needles for acupuncture, using knowledge of the pulse and pain as indicators, a condition referred to as &quot;Minor Summer Blockage.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;Minor Summer Blockage&quot; is also named for its occurrence in March and April when the two forms of yang combine strongly.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>The muscle of the Hand Taiyin originates above the thumb, travels upward along the finger, connects at the back of the hand, runs along the outside of the wrist, ascends the arm, connects at the center of the elbow, moves to the inner side of the upper arm, enters the armpit, emerges from the axillary cavity, connects at the front of the shoulder, further connects at the axillary cavity again, descends to the chest, disperses to the diaphragm, and converges to the lower ribs reaching the lateral sides of the abdomen. Its ailments manifest as pain in the muscles along its path, which can lead to severe breathlessness, hypochondrial pain, and spitting blood. Treatment involves cauterization with needles, determining the treatment by the number of needle points, and using pain as a guide; this is named the mid-winter disorder.</p>
<p>(Note: The twelve muscle channels correspond to the yin and yang vitality, and when the qi is reversed, it results in breathlessness; when blood follows the qi, it can lead to spitting blood. &quot;Zai&quot; refers to the eleventh lunar month, and the Taiyin governs qi, hence the name mid-winter disorder.)</p>
<p>The muscle of the Hand Yangming originates from the middle finger and runs parallel to the muscle of the Hand Taiyin, connecting at the inner elbow, traveling along the inner arm, connecting at the armpit, and dispersing forward and backward around the ribs. Its branches enter the armpit, disperse within the chest, and connect at the arm. Its ailments along its path reveal muscular pain, leading to chest distress and breathlessness.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The treatment involves burning needles and stabbing to know and calculate, and based on pain to identify specific points, which is called &quot;the first winter obstruction.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: &quot;The first winter&quot; refers to the month of October, when the two Yin energies intersect completely, hence the name &quot;the first winter obstruction.&quot;)</p>
<p>The lesser Yin meridian begins on the inner side of the little finger and connects to the sharp bone, ascending to bind at the inner elbow and then entering the armpit, intersecting with the greater Yin. It follows along the breast and connects in the chest, along the arm—traditional texts mentioning it follow from the buttocks, but according to &quot;The Spiritual Pivot,&quot; it has been corrected. The classic &quot;Tai Su&quot; mentions it as following the diaphragm, which seems more fitting. It descends to connect at the navel. </p>
<p>The internal affliction manifests as urgency, with the heart bearing the concealed beam, causing the elbow network below; pain occurs where the tendons cross. Treatment is through burning needles and stabbing to know and calculate, using pain to identify points. If pus and blood are produced in the concealed beam, there is no cure.</p>
<p>In terms of tendon conditions, cold causes the tendons to retract and become tight, while heat causes them to loosen and fail to contract, leading to Yin impotence and non-function. If Yang is urgent, it results in retraction; if Yin is urgent, it results in inability to extend.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The term &quot;scorch and prick&quot; refers to the urgent chill. When there is heat, the tendons do not contract, making moxibustion needles ineffective. This is called &quot;winter&#39;s end ailment.&quot; </p>
<p>(Note: The Shaoyin is primarily Yin but signifies Yang, hence there are indications of cold and heat, Yin and Yang. The twelfth month being the Ox month, the Shaoyin governs Qi, thus it is termed &quot;winter&#39;s end ailment.&quot;)</p>
<p>If the Yangming of the foot or the Taiyang of the hand has taut tendons, the eyes and mouth have issues – the gaze becomes strained, and one cannot fully see; treatment should be as described.</p>
<p>(Note: The tendons of the foot Yangming run alongside the mouth and beneath the eyes; the tendons of the hand Taiyang end at the jaw and connect to the outer canthus of the eye. Therefore, if the left tendon is taut, the mouth deviates to the left, and one should treat the left side; if the right tendon is taut, the mouth deviates to the right, so treatment should focus on the right. If the left eye cannot fully see, the ailment is on the left; likewise for the right eye. If both eyes are strained, both sides are affected. Thus, the treatment follows the aforementioned principles, while the condition remains differentiated by left and right.)</p>
<p>The chapter on the internal organs:</p>
<p>The meridians are responsible for the circulation of blood and Qi, nourishing Yin and Yang, moistening tendons and bones, and benefiting the joints. Therefore, when the blood is harmonious, the meridians flow, nourishing Yin and Yang, strengthening tendons and bones, and maintaining clear and functional joints.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Yin-Yang and the Twenty-Five Individuals</strong></p>
<p>Below the Foot Taiyin, if the blood and qi are deficient, it is good for the muscles to cramp, and there will be pain beneath the heel. [Note: The cramping and heel pain indicate that the deficiency of blood and qi prevents nourishment of the muscles and bones.]</p>
<p><strong>The Treatise on Pathogenic Factors</strong></p>
<p>In the earth there are forests and trees, in humans there are tensions in the muscles. </p>
<p>When there is a pathogen affecting the lungs and heart, its qi stays at both elbows; when there is a pathogen in the liver, its qi resides at both armpits; when there is a pathogen in the spleen, its qi remains at both thighs; when there is a pathogen in the kidneys, its qi lingers at both knees. </p>
<p>All these eight areas of deficiency are chambers of the joints, pathways of true qi, and places where blood circulation occurs. Pathogenic qi and stasis of blood cannot settle; if they do settle, they harm the meridians, and the joints and mechanisms cannot flex and extend, hence the occurrence of cramps. </p>
<p>[Note: The areas of both elbows, armpits, thighs, and knees represent the junctions of joints, from which the spirit and qi of the heart emerge. If there is a pathogen in the five organs, qi will remain here and cannot disperse. The pathways of true qi refer to the meridians of the five organs, each passing through these areas. If pathogenic qi stays, it injures the meridians, meaning that the pathogen lingers in the skin and does not depart, thus harming the meridians. The notion of chambers of the joints pertains to the intersections of joints, from which the blood and qi of the five organs emerge into the flesh and skin, without entering the blood vessels. Therefore, if there is a pathogen in the five organs, qi will remain here. If externally affected by pathogenic qi, stasis of blood will reside here, leading to an inability of the joints and mechanisms to flex and extend, which causes cramps.]<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>On the True Evil of External Factors</strong></p>
<p>The intrusion of external evils into the body is profound; cold and heat clash, lingering for long periods and becoming entrenched within. If cold prevails over heat, it results in bone pain and muscle atrophy; if heat overcomes cold, it leads to rotting flesh and decaying muscles, resulting in pus and internal injury to the bones. Internal injury to the bones leads to bone erosion. If there is prior ailment in the tendons, they become bent and unable to stretch, with the evil qi residing in between and not resolving, resulting in tendon spasms. </p>
<p><em>Note: The clash of cold and heat refers to the interplay of yin and yang within the physical form. When the form is damaged, it causes qi to be ill; when qi is injured, it results in illness of the form. The qi that culminates here comes from the clash of cold and heat, adhering to the form of evil where it remains.</em></p>
<p><strong>On the Nine Needles</strong></p>
<p>The body suffers while the mind seeks joy; illness arises in the tendons, to be treated with heating methods.</p>
<p><strong>On Reducing Tendon Illness</strong></p>
<p>Four forms of damage affect the tendons, causing them to become slack and unable to support themselves.</p>
<p><strong>On Cramping Tendons</strong><a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>If one observes the liver pulse, with a clean external presentation and a greenish face showing anger; if the internal signs show movement in the left side of the abdomen, which when pressed feels hard and painful; if the illness involves fullness and constriction in the limbs, difficulty in urination and defecation, and cramping, then it is the liver. If these signs are absent, it is not.</p>
<p>The liver pulse indicates the diagnosis of the liver. The liver and gallbladder together form the repository of cleanliness, hence the cleanliness in appearance. The liver is the general&#39;s organ, thus the greenish face and anger correspond to the liver&#39;s nature. The movement noted in the left side of the abdomen indicates the liver area; if pressing it reveals hardness and pain, it signifies the movement in the liver&#39;s energy.</p>
<p>The sinews converge at Yanglingquan.</p>
<p>This pertains to the lesser yang sinews, which end at Yanglingquan, situated one inch below the knee on its outer side. Furthermore, the gallbladder is paired with the liver; the liver governs the sinews, thus it is known as the meeting point of the sinews.</p>

<p>Sour flavors injure the sinews; if the sinews are injured, they become weak, a condition termed &quot;leakage.&quot; Salty flavors harm the bones; if the bones are injured, they become atrophied, a condition termed &quot;wasting.&quot; Leakage and atrophy oppose each other, leading to a situation called &quot;broken leakage.&quot; When the circulating energy is obstructed, the protective energy cannot function independently, both energies are weak, the triple burner is unable to manage, the four systems are severed, the body becomes emaciated, with only the feet swelling, yellow sweat appearing, and cold shins; if heat arises, it manifests as intermittent fever.</p>
<p><strong>Cramping</strong></p>
<p>As for the illness of cramping, the individual&#39;s arms and legs are straight, the pulse moves up and down, is slightly tense, and if the cramp is felt in the abdomen, it is treated with the remedy for chicken droppings, which is the primary treatment for this condition.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>The Classic of Internal Medicine by Hua Tuo</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Muscular Diseases: Good and Evil</strong></p>
<p>If the heart pulse is extremely urgent, it leads to convulsions; if slightly urgent, it causes pain in the heart that leads to pain in the waist and back, and one cannot eat. If the spleen pulse is extremely urgent, it leads to convulsions; if slightly urgent, it causes obstruction in the diaphragm, preventing food from entering and causing it to be expelled. When the tendons are severed and the soul is startled, resulting in faintness and fear, with blue hands, feet, and nails, and incessant shouting, one will die in eight or nine days. Muscular numbness arises from excessive anger, shouting at inappropriate times, rushing while walking, or excessive indulgence harming the liver, leading to the loss of its energy. Consequently, cold and heat invade, persisting for a long time and flowing into the tendons, causing tension that cannot be relieved, hence the term &quot;muscular numbness.&quot; It is necessary to invigorate the blood to nourish the liver, warm the energy to support the kidneys, and then take medicated pills or decoctions. If the treatment aligns with the underlying principles, one will recover naturally; otherwise, it will cause harm. The pulse will be tight, string-like, urgent, and powerful at the left guan position.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Manual by Wang Shuhe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis for Muscular Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The song of the liver pulse says: Tightness is due to muscular tension in slight measure. It also states: If it is greatly floating and the muscles weak, the body lacks strength; encountering this, one may feel the entire body become limp. Another verse mentions: If there are twenty-nine weak pulses concealed, the internal organs and tendons are completely obstructed. It further adds: If the pulse overflows at the guan position and responds at the inch position, the visual heaviness feels weighty, accompanied by tendon pain. The spleen pulse song states: Tightness in the spleen leads to pain, and also involves muscular tension causing restraint. One desires to vomit but cannot; the pressure remains unrelieved.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Muscle Extremity</strong></p>
<p>Muscle extremity primarily concerns the liver. The liver corresponds to the muscles, and the muscles are connected to the liver. When the liver is ill, it manifests in the muscles. It is also said: when one encounters an illness in spring, it is related to muscle blockage. If the blockage persists, it can be affected by external pathogenic factors, which reside in the liver, leading to the inward flow of yang energy and the outward flow of yin energy. When yin energy escapes, it becomes deficient; when deficient, the muscles become weak. Weak muscles lead to excessive sorrow, and a pale, discolored appearance can be seen below the eyes. If there is damage from cold, the muscles cannot move; the fingers and nails all hurt, and there is a tendency for muscle cramping. The source of this is being exposed to wind on a spring day, resulting in wind affecting the muscles, indicating liver deficiency with wind. If the yang energy rises internally, it becomes substantial; when substantial, the muscles are solid. Solid muscles can lead to excessive anger and dryness in the throat; heat injuries can cause coughing, which leads to pain in the sides and an inability to turn, resulting in a fullness and pain in the muscles of the legs. Hence, it is said to be a solid wind affecting the liver. Therefore, treat it according to its lightness or heaviness, reflect on its deficiency or fullness. Examine its yin and yang to differentiate between soft and hard. When yang disease applies to yin, treat the yin disease with yang. Those skilled in treating illnesses address issues within the skin, muscles, and meridians first; next, treat the six fu organs. If one treats the five zang organs, the patient finds themselves in a state between life and death.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Turning of the Muscles</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: &quot;Turning&quot; means reversing. When hot qi becomes dry and scorches the muscles, it causes cramps and pain, as fire is the master of burning and drying movement. Some mistakenly believe that cold is the guest in the muscles. However, although cold is associated with contraction, it only causes reversal and inhibition, making movement difficult; how could it cause the turning of the muscles? &quot;Turning&quot; refers to movement. Yang is active while Yin is still, which proves heat. </p>
<p>The turning of the muscles often stems from excessive heat disrupting the body leading to vomiting and diarrhea. When the spleen and stomach weaken, the liver wood becomes excessive, and heat dries out the muscles, thus causing the turning of the muscles. Generally, thirst indicates heat. In cases of disruption and turning of the muscles without thirst, such instances are rare. Sometimes it does not arise from vomiting or diarrhea, but from external cold invading, leading to the closure of the pores, with yang qi stagnating, causing internal heat and dryness in the muscles, which results in the turning of the muscles. </p>
<p>Therefore, for all cases of turning of the muscles, using hot water to soak the area facilitates the opening and expulsion of the pores. When yang qi disperses, healing occurs. Because healing through hot water leads to improvement, people commonly mistakenly attribute it to cold. The hot qi, dry and scorching in the muscles, leads to turning and pain. Concerning wind associated with the liver, in severe cases, there may be continuous vomiting, with the added heat causing diarrhea, indicating a predominance of dampness. If three types of qi mix together, it results in disruption.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Contraction and Urgency</strong></p>
<p>The body is cold, unable to be warmed by a heavy coat; the kidney essence is dried up and not functioning. The marrow is insufficient, the tendons weak, and thus the frozen limbs lead to contractions and urgency. The formula &quot;Fuzi Decoction&quot; is indicated for this.</p>
<p>For abdominal pain from gu (a type of poison), the kidneys affect the heart, and the tendons and vessels pull together resulting in urgency. The essence is scant, and the tendons are not nourished, causing urgency. The &quot;Jianzhong Decoction&quot; with modifications is indicated for this.</p>
<p>When the pulse is excessively rapid, and the tendons are tight, this manifests in the abdomen and must correspondingly be urgent. A rapid pulse is also a sign of deficiency; when the tendons are evident, it is referred to by name. The &quot;Baitzi Ren Powder&quot; is indicated for this.</p>
<p>All heat-related confusion and conditions belong to fire. When heat prevails, it causes muddled confusion and obscurity. &quot;Muddled&quot; refers to confusion. According to the classics, the disease where the tendons and vessels pull together resulting in urgency is called &quot;confusion&quot; (zhie), hence the common term &quot;contraction.&quot; </p>
<p>When heat overcomes, it clashes with wind, affecting the meridians, causing wind to act and remain unsettled. The interaction of wind and fire leads to heat-induced confusion and the arising of contractions. </p>
<p>Treatment principle: Use remedies to dispel wind and clear heat, reducing the severity of the fire for contraction to resolve quickly. If one recklessly applies burning fire or gives medicines to induce sweating, it could lead to death without respite.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Strength and Weakness</strong></p>
<p>The texts state: Various sudden muscular contractions, joint pains, and abdominal urgency with muscle tightness are all due to sudden wind disturbances. &quot;Strong&quot; refers to strength that is powerful yet not gentle. &quot;Straight&quot; signifies strong and forceful muscles. &quot;Joint pain&quot; pertains to the pressure on the joints. A firm support with tense muscles leads to pain. &quot;Contraction&quot; indicates tightening. &quot;Deviate&quot; means to go awry. It is said that muscle tightness and abdominal urgency are due to abnormalities and illness. Dried metal corresponds to contraction and tightness; when wind and wood are at play, they cause illness, reflecting the transformations of dried metal, and excessive conditions can harm the internal organs and lead to control issues. Additionally, wind can overcome dampness leading to dryness, and thus, in the tenth month, wind illnesses become severe. Loose muscles are indicative of extreme dryness. Therefore, all severe wind conditions are also associated with dryness.</p>
<p>Contractions and stiffness in the muscles, strong yet not gentle, are due to the tranquility of the earth. Yin contractions are termed soft spasms, while yang contractions are called hard spasms. Excessive conditions are harmful, leading to internal complications, hence extreme dampness can counter wind transformations. However, those that combine transformations may show false appearances, and in reality, they are not wind-related. When thoughts are endless, and one’s desires remain unfulfilled, leading to excessive external fantasies and inappropriate behaviors, it can result in muscle weakness, and also lead to implications of sexual indulgence. Excessive behaviors associate with white substances in indulgence, which subsequently lead to weakness and exhaustion; therefore, the &quot;Secret True Pill&quot; is recommended for treatment.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Emesis Therapy</strong></p>
<p>Some say: What is the purpose of inducing vomiting for muscle diseases? The answer is: to relieve the stagnation of the liver. What is meant by &quot;relieve&quot; is to allow the pathways to be open. If there is also impact, falls, or injuries, first induce vomiting using herbal powder (Jinhua San); then use Chengqi Decoction afterward. The term &quot;Cheng&quot; implies a smooth progression. For women suffering from muscle spasms and bone pain, use Shenying San to induce vomiting.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Tetany</strong></p>
<p>How can we clarify the condition of tetany due to cold damage? &quot;Tetany&quot; refers to tense and contracted muscles. &quot;Tetany&quot; also indicates loose and relaxed muscles. When the muscles are tense, they contract; when they are relaxed, they extend. Either contracting or extending, when in motion and ceaseless, it is referred to as tetany, commonly known as &quot;spasm.&quot; The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: when the muscles and tendons are drawn and tense, it is called tetany. &quot;Tetany&quot; implies something like a tight fit, while &quot;spasm&quot; suggests something like a loose release. When in motion, it&#39;s relaxed; when at rest, it&#39;s tense. This indicates that the tense condition is termed tetany, and the relaxed condition is called spasm, which is quite clear.</p>
<p>Tetany and spasm arise from wind disorders, and seizures can also manifest as tetany. In the case of cold damage leading to tetany, it indicates that pathogenic heat has reached an extreme. If heat is intense, it can provoke the wind, impacting the meridians. The wind is active, causing the limbs to be in a state of tetany and unrest. Thus, when wind warmth meets fire, the result is a mild yellow appearance; if severe, it resembles a frantic seizure, sometimes resulting in tetany, indicating the intensity of the heat. When the condition of cold damage progresses to tetany, the disease has advanced significantly, making it hard to treat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: when the yang stage concludes, the eyes are averted, and tetany occurs; there is a cessation of sweat, which is large and pearl-like, sticking to the body without flowing. This displays that the condition of tetany signifies a disease that has progressed. There may also be stubbornness in the limbs, where they move restlessly but lack the strength to flex or extend. This is a sign of liver deficiency. Although the symptoms of tetany can be difficult to manage, if one can eliminate wind and clear heat with appropriate medications to diminish the intense heat, there is a chance for recovery. However, if one recklessly applies cautery or administers medications to induce perspiration, they may face imminent death.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Muscle Spasms</strong></p>
<p>How can we clarify the understanding of muscle spasms caused by cold damage? The symptoms of cold damage include headache, body aches, aversion to cold, and fever, which are definitive indicators. When there are prominent muscle spasms and twitching, it is essential that excessive sweating leads to a loss of Yang energy. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that Yang energy nourishes the spirit when it is pure and nourishes the muscles when it is flexible. Excess sweating leads to a depletion of fluids, causing Yang energy to become excessively deficient and the muscles to lose their nourishment, resulting in spasms and twitching.</p>
<p>In cases of Taiyang disease with weak pulses and sweating combined with aversion to wind, one must not take the Da Qinglong Decoction, for doing so would cause counteractions and lead to muscle spasms and twitching, which is a reversal. If the movement of Qi is on the left, one must not induce sweating. Inducing sweating would cause dizziness, persistent sweating, and muscle spasms. Observing this, it is evident that muscle spasms and twitching arise from excessive sweating leading to a loss of Yang energy, which is visibly deficient. Even though this is a reversal, it should be understood that it stems from sweating leading to a loss of Yang energy and exterior deficiency. Treatment should focus on warming the channels and boosting Yang energy.</p>
<p>If there are also symptoms from vomiting, purging, and sweating, resulting in both interior and exterior deficiency, the situation is different from that caused solely by sweating. The classic text states: after vomiting and purging in cold damage, if there is excessive deficiency with restlessness, a markedly weak pulse, and symptoms persisting for eight or nine days—such as a feeling of fullness below the heart, pain below the ribs, and Qi surging up to the throat, leading to dizziness and muscle pulsations—this can result in prolonged weakness. This scenario is a severe form of reversal. </p>
<p>The classic text notes: if the movement of Qi is on the left, one must not induce sweating; doing so will cause dizziness, persistent sweating, and muscle spasms. This indicates that excess sweating affects the liver Qi.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>On External Pathogenic Factors</strong><br>By Li Gao of the Yuan Dynasty</p>
<p>The evil qi of heaven, when it affects a person, harms the five organs. It is the evil of the eight winds, and this wind evil injures the muscles and bones. When the wind impacts from above, it injures the muscles, while the cold harms the bones. This is because tangible substances fall ill, connected to the lower jiao, specifically the liver and kidneys. The liver and kidneys represent the qi of the earth. The &quot;Nan Jing&quot; explains that when the qi of the liver and kidneys is depleted within, it is because the liver governs the muscles and the kidneys govern the bones; therefore, when the wind evil affects a person, it causes pain in the muscles and bones. If the muscles and bones are exhausted, then the foundation of the kidneys and liver is also depleted. This represents an excess condition.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Internal and External Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Internal injuries and illnesses arise when the vital energy of the heart and lungs is depleted from the exterior, leading to lethargy and a desire to lie down, with the limbs feeling heavy and unable to move. This is due to heat damaging the original vital energy. The spleen governs the limbs, and when affected by heat, it lacks the energy to move. The classics say heat injures qi and also that heat causes bones to dissolve and muscles to slacken; this is what is meant. </p>
<p>In contrast, external injuries from wind and cold occur when the vital energies of the kidneys and liver are depleted internally. The kidneys govern the bones and are affected by cold, while the liver governs the muscles and is affected by wind. Since ancient times, conditions of the kidneys and liver have been treated similarly, as they mutually support each other. Thus, the classics state that the gallbladder governs the muscles, and the bladder governs the bones. Whether from a stroke or from catching a cold, once the illness strikes, one may fall into bed, unable to rise; it is not merely a lack of strength, but pain in the muscles and bones resulting in immobility, indicating injury to the physical form. The classics say cold damages the physical condition, and also that cold causes muscle cramps and bone pain; this is what is meant.</p>
<p><strong>Atrophy and Stretching</strong></p>
<p>Heat in the liver leads to muscle atrophy, causing the muscles to become slackened. All forms of atrophy belong to the upper regions, indicating that the root of the illness lies in the lungs. Therefore, it must first arise in the lungs, after which the heat spreads to the five organs, resulting in various forms of atrophy.</p>

<p>Muscle cramps and spasms lead to the contraction of the yin, with both legs cramping; these symptoms belong to the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian. When spasms are severe, they belong to the Hand Jueyin and Taiyin.</p>
<p><strong>Spasm Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For continuous spasms, men should use their hands to pull the yin, and women should use their hands to draw the breast towards either side; this is a wonderful method from the &quot;Thousand Golds.&quot; Such spasms are linked to blood heat; one should take Siwu Decoction with added wine, Scutellaria, safflower, Atractylodes, and Nanking star. If there is cold, abdominal fullness and pain, limbs stiff and tense, and spasms causing diarrhea, one should take the Lizhong Decoction with added fresh Aconite and Cinnamon.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Dryness</strong></p>
<p>The text states: “All that is withered and drained dry, with firm tendons and cracked dry skin, pertains to dryness.” &quot;Yuan Disease Form&quot; states: &quot;The classics say wind, heat, and fire are all yang; cold, dryness, and dampness are all yin.” Dryness and dampness are somewhat different. However, drying metal corresponds to autumn yin, which differs from cold dampness; thus, it reacts similarly to wind heat. When fire is hot, metal weakens and wind arises, because wind can overcome dampness, and heat can deplete fluids and lead to cold. When yang is strong and yin is weak, then wind heat triumphs over water dampness and causes dryness. In general, wind diseases in people arise mostly due to excess heat, wherein wind-dryness coexists, with heat being the dominant factor. The liver governs the tendons; when wind is excessive and combined with dryness and heat, the tendons become exceedingly dry. Dry metal is responsible for contraction, resulting in tense and urgent pulses, leading to muscle stiffness and mouth closure.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>Some may suffer from excessive dryness and heat, leading to the dehydration of the spleen and stomach, resulting in thirst; others may experience severe wind-heat, which remains at the surface while the internal energy is balanced; some may find it hard to stretch and feel tightness in their sinews; at times, they may feel cold with twitching muscles. In addition, the combination of wind, heat, and dryness may cause significant stagnation internally, leading to restlessness and possibly constipation. In cases of wind invasion, it can emerge from excessive heat and dryness, transforming into phlegm, causing dryness in the chest and diaphragm, leading to symptoms of dizziness, faintness, and collapse. All these manifestations arise from the excess of heat that creates dryness. The variations in illnesses are due to the differing degrees of wind, heat, and dryness. The phenomenon of muscle relaxation in cases of wind is caused by the predominance of wind-heat over dampness, leading to pronounced dryness. Under such circumstances, relaxation of the muscles results in weakness and numbness, hence various symptoms of stagnation and weakness are related to the lung metal, indicating the transformation of dryness. When autumn deepens and dryness intensifies, grasses and trees wither and do not thrive, reflecting the signs of illness. Thus, when blood is sufficient, one can grasp and maintain strength; when blood is ample in the legs, one can walk. The illness of dryness leads to diminished blood and fluids, which cannot nourish the body’s structure, resulting in these phenomena.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Muscle Pain</p>
<p>When wind causes muscle pain, it is due to insufficient blood nourishing the muscles, referred to as muscle dryness, and it is untreatable.<br>Key Points for Diagnosis and Treatment [Ming - Dai Sigong]</p>
<p>Muscle Tension</p>
<p>The liver governs the muscles, belonging to the wood element, and wind easily enters this realm. When the liver is affected by wind, the muscles become weak and lack nourishment, resulting in conditions such as paralysis, slurred speech, and tongue stiffness.<br>Muscle Cramps</p>
<p>In cases of cholera with muscle cramps, add one penny of fried frozen gelatin to the principle remedy, and bind the legs. If cramps extend to the abdomen or the entire body, they cannot be treated. For muscle cramps, soak in warm juice of the curved plant or in a strong salt solution, refer to cholera treatments. For cramps in the feet, use dragon gelatin powder.<br>For conditions resembling foot ailments and typhus, if there is sudden weakness in the feet, numbness in the lower abdomen, full-body cramps, vomiting after eating, or red swelling in both shins, seek treatment within the category of foot ailments.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Medical Guidelines - &quot;Yizong Ganyao&quot; by Lou Ying</strong></p>
<p><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Suwen&quot; states: if the heart pulse is extremely rapid, it indicates epilepsy. This is a deficiency of heart fire and should be treated with a heart-boosting medicine like Niu Huang San. &quot;The Ling Shu&quot; mentions: if the heart pulse is full and large, there is muscular contraction indicating real heat in the heart; it should be treated by draining heart fire with medicine like Liqing Wan. A rapid and small liver pulse also indicates muscular contraction, implying liver deficiency; it should be treated with Xu Duan Wan. If the liver pulse is strong, one should first treat the spleen, and it is advisable to use Jia Wei Jian Zhong Tang.</p>
<p>&quot;The Suwen&quot; also states: if the spleen pulse is extremely rapid, it indicates epilepsy, as spleen deficiency leads to the liver overpowering it, hence it is necessary to strengthen the earth and drain the liver wood. Epilepsy with persistent profuse sweating indicates deficiency, while absence of sweat with appetite shows excess.</p>
<p>There are two types of epilepsy related to Qi: One is fire. The classics say: when fire is constrained, people suffer from vomiting and epilepsy. It also says: when Shaoyang is affected, there is a violent reaction leading to epilepsy. Furthermore, it states: when Shaoyang governs the sky, and the guest prevails, epilepsy results. The second type is water. The texts say: when Yangming governs the sky, dry qi descends, and wood qi follows, people suffer from rib pain and red eyes, with trembling. It also mentions that when soil is excessive, and moisture flows, people suffer from leg weakness and epilepsy. Additionally, when Taiyin returns, there is severe pain at the crown of the head, and epilepsy is especially pronounced.</p>
<p>[Note: The statement &quot;Yangming governs the sky&quot; refers to liver wood disease; thus, the mention of water is incorrect.]<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Ancient and Modern Medical Insights</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Gong Xin)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blue Veins</strong></p>
<p>The condition of blue veins arises when the original qi goes against the natural flow, causing blood to stagnate and lead to the accumulation of toxic blood that attacks the heart. This often results from various causes: an accumulation of anger, obstructed emotions due to worry or depression, damaging cold after excessive sexual activity, or exposure to cold and dampness, leading to fuzzy mental states, heart palpitations, chest tightness, nausea, dizziness, oppressive fullness in the chest and abdomen, sharp pains in the sides, headaches, bitter mouth, dry tongue, a bluish face with blackened lips, heavy and fatigued limbs, achy joints, and possible aversion to cold or strong heat, along with numbness and tingling throughout the body and cold, trembling hands and feet, all indicating that toxic blood is attacking the heart. Since ancient times, few have discussed this, and those who suffer from it find no effective treatment. The only remedy suggested is to use needles to prick the blue veins at the curved pool points on both hands to draw out purple blood; while many are treated this way, some may recover immediately, some do not, and some may develop more severe conditions. Those who frequently experience this ailment might have episodes once a month or two to three times, and repeated treatments yield little success.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>I humbly consider human life to be fundamentally dependent on vital energy and blood. Therefore, Danxi stated: when energy and blood are harmonized, no disease arises; when they are deficient, countless ailments emerge. Moreover, this illness first damages the energy, and then further depletes the blood, leading to few instances of premature death. However, there is no method to withdraw blood, and one cannot avoid acupuncture; otherwise, stagnant blood attacks the heart and immediate rescue is necessary. I have formulated a remedy, often effective, called the White Tiger Pill, associated with the western lung and metal. The blue veins are associated with the eastern liver and wood. Treating blue veins with the White Tiger is because metal can conquer wood; therefore, how could any ailment not be cured? The brilliance of this formula lies not only in alleviating the suffering of acupuncture on the blue veins and healing the blue vein condition but also in preventing future troubles; isn&#39;t its benefit significant? This formula simultaneously treats men&#39;s long-standing dysentery with bloody stools and women&#39;s uterine bleeding and discharge, as well as all internal injuries from trauma where blood cannot circulate, causing unbearable pain in the heart and abdomen—upon taking it, its effect is like the shadow of a drumstick. It is noted that the blue vein condition is commonly suffered by people in the north, while those in the south might experience similar symptoms of heat illness.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Medical Handbook [Ming – Zhao Xianke]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Muscle Tightening</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Winds causing dizziness, joint pain, and muscle tightening are attributed to the Qi of the Wind-Wood of the Jue Yin. From the Greater Cold to the Lesser Fullness, the positions of the Wind and Wood are governed by the Fire. Wind is active, good at causing rapid changes; Wood flourishes and gives rise to Fire. Wind and Fire belong to Yang and often lead to rigidity; thus, the Yangming Dry Metal is associated with contraction and tightening. When Wind and Wood cause illness, they manifest as a transformation into Dry Metal. Overindulgence can lead to harm from the excessive and consequently is curtailed, suggesting that Wood, when it reaches its peak, resembles Metal. Furthermore, Wind can overcome Dampness and thus becomes Dry; when Wind illness appears severe, it results in muscle tightening, the extreme of dryness. Such symptoms are indeed caused by the dominance of Wind, treated with cooling methods, and it is not suitable to use cinnamon or aconite. </p>
<p>If one asks: Is the Minor Renewing Life Decoction appropriate in these times? The answer is: Not necessarily. The Minor Renewing Life Decoction is a modification of the formula for treating winter&#39;s direct invasion of Wind-Cold from Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Coffer.&quot;<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>In the midst of following the patterns of the Six Classics for evidence, adjustments are made incrementally, and it is not convenient to use the entire prescriptions as a standard. For instance, if there is no sweating from the sun (Taiyang), increase the amounts of ephedra (Mahuang), apricot kernels (Xingren), and ledebouriella root (Fangfeng) in the base prescription; if there is sweating and aversion to wind, increase the amounts of cinnamon (Guizhi), peony (Shaoyao), and apricot kernels. If in Yangming there is no sweating, and the body is hot but not averse to wind, add gypsum (Shigao),zhi mu (Zhi Mu), and licorice (Gancao) to the base prescription; if there is sweating, body heat but not aversion to wind, add kudzu root (Gegen), cinnamon, and scutellaria (Huangqin). If the sun is present without sweating and the body feels cool, add aconite (Fuzhi), dried ginger (Ganjing), and licorice. In Shaoyin when there is sweating without heat, add cinnamon, aconite, and licorice. </p>
<p>In cases of windstroke without these four signs, if the Six Classics are confused, pertaining to Shaoyang and Jueyin, or if there is joint pain or numbness and lack of sensation, continue the life-saving dosage of eight taels, adding four taels of qianghuo (Qianghuo) and six taels of forsythia (Lianqiao). This is the exterior symptom of an excess in the Six Classics, and treatment should start with the resolution of sweating. If there is obstruction in urination and defecation, consider using Sanhua Decoction or a local prescription of hemp seed pills for relief. However, since where the evil gathers, its energy must be deficient, there is often more internal injury than external invasion in the world, and this prescription should not be used lightly.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber - Treatment for Muscle Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The muscles of the entire body should not suffer from ailments; if they do, they will contract and cause pain. To relax the muscles, one must harmonize the blood, thus treating the muscles requires treating the blood. If a person experiences muscle tightness, hunchback, and inability to stand upright, they are suffering from a muscle disease. One should use one ounce of Dong Quai, five qian each of white peony, coix seed, raw rehmannia, and original reference, along with one qian of chaihu, boiled in water for consumption. The uniqueness of this formula lies in the use of chaihu among nourishing blood herbs. It is known that blood deficiency leads to muscle disease, and thus using blood-nourishing herbs should suffice; however, why also include chaihu to help dispel? It is essential to understand that the muscles are a surplus of the liver. When liver qi is not flowing smoothly, the muscles tighten abnormally, even leading to hunching. By using chaihu to relieve the stagnant liver qi, and combining it with substantial blood-nourishing agents, the muscles receive their nourishment and relaxation, and thus all symptoms will be resolved.</p>
<p>For treatment of muscle diseases, use three qian of Dong Quai, one ounce of peony root, two ounces of cooked rehmannia, five qian of rice poria, and one qian each of cinnamon, chaihu, and white mustard seed, boiled in water for consumption. This formula serves to treat both the kidney and liver. Although the muscles belong to the liver, nourishing the liver requires attention to the kidneys. Now, with a strong supplementation of the kidneys and the addition of herbs that soothe the liver, how could the muscles not be made comfortable and well-nourished?<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Ancient and Modern Books: Complete Record of the Medical Department, Volume 215</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: In spring, acupuncture at autumn equinox can relieve muscle spasms and counteract adverse qi, which can cause coughing, and if the condition does not improve, it may lead to sudden fright and weeping. If the disease is in the vessels, acupuncture at the vessel will not injure the muscles; if the muscles are injured, it will affect the liver, and if the liver is affected, the spring illness will manifest as heat causing the muscles to relax. Acupuncture that targets the muscles will not injure the flesh, but when it reaches the flesh, it could affect the muscles. Acupuncture that targets the flesh without affecting the muscles will pass through and touch the muscles. This is known as reversal. </p>
<p>When the disease is in the muscles, causing spasms and joint pain, it may prevent movement, and this is called muscle paralysis. Acupuncture should be done on the muscles above, and the treatment should not reach the bones. If the disease arises from muscle distension, and if the condition has ceased, it should be noted. </p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; says: For joint acupuncture, the needle should be inserted directly on either side along the muscles to address muscle paralysis; caution should be taken to avoid bleeding, as this corresponds to the liver. Some refer to this as &quot;Yuan acupuncture,&quot; or &quot;Qi acupuncture.&quot; </p>
<p>For &quot;Hui acupuncture,&quot; the needle is inserted on the sides, lifting it forward and backward, to relieve muscle tension and treat muscle paralysis. If the arm is bent and cannot stretch, the issue lies in the muscles; if it stretches but cannot bend, the issue is in the bones. One should focus on preserving the bones with bone issues and the muscles with muscle issues. </p>
<p>When dealing with muscle cramps in the yang, treat the yang; when handling muscle cramps in the yin, treat the yin—all of this requires precise acupuncture. For violent cramps, convulsions, and dizziness, if the feet cannot support the body, one should target the Tian Zhu point.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>Those suffering from convulsive diseases exhibit weakness and tension; severe needling at the large spine and major vessels of the neck is necessary. They experience excessive vomiting of foamy fluid and downward gas release; if left untreated, it worsens. </p>
<p>In cases of fevers, with a pale face, headaches, and restless limbs, needling between the tendons with the fourth needle at the four extremes is advised. For muscle atrophy and drowning vision, one must seek the tendons linked to the liver; if that fails, then those related to metal, which corresponds to the lungs. </p>
<p>In fevers accompanied by frequent scares, leading to seizures and madness, the pulse should be taken, using the fourth needle to drain the excess. If convulsive diseases cause hair loss, blood should be sought from the heart; if that fails, look to water, which relates to the kidneys. </p>
<p>For heart pain accompanied by back tension, and if there are sudden seizures as if the heart is being touched from behind, it indicates kidney-related heart pain. First, needle the Jinggu and Kunlun; if the needling doesn’t stop, then proceed to the Rangu point.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes these ailments? Qi Bo replied: If the stomach is insufficient, all pulses become weak. If the pulses are weak, the tendons become lax; when the tendons are lax, the energy cannot restore itself, leading to ailments. Therefore, one should supplement the areas where weakness exists, nourishing the flesh in between.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao: How do you know the diseases of the tendons? Bo Gao replied: The colors of the eyes—blue, yellow, red, white, and black—indicate illness in the tendons. The tendon area has neither yin nor yang, neither left nor right; it is important to observe where the illness is located. The Yellow Emperor asked: How can this be treated? Bo Gao said: Diseases change and manifest in various ways, sometimes floating, sometimes sinking, sometimes appearing shallow, and at other times deep; they cannot be fully exhausted in understanding, as each exists in its own place. For illnesses in between, treat them lightly; for those that are severe, treat them deeply; adjust the qi according to the changes, hence it is said to be skilled work. </p>
<p>The &quot;Classic of Changes&quot; states: Sudden chest pain, spasms in succession, pain inside the elbow, a feeling of fullness in the heart, treat accordingly. </p>
<p>For heat diseases, first accompanied by spasms in the arms, the lips and mouth open, the nose flares, sweating beneath the eyes like turning pearls, if pain is two inches below the breasts and the sides are hard and full with palpitation, treat using Lie Que. </p>
<p>For chill with spasms, the hand cannot stretch, accompanied by a cough and thick phlegm, and a sensation of blockage with nausea, treat using Chi Ze. </p>
<p>For great wind with silent pain, a tendency to sleep and be startled, and spasms, treat using Tian Jing. </p>

The &quot;Qian Jin Fang&quot; mentions: with abdominal fullness and convulsions, heart pain with gas fullness that cannot be exhaled, the major point is the abdomen. During vomiting blood accompanied by convulsions, shaking the head vigorously, turning blue in the face, and sweating less than the shoulders, treat with Quze for cold damage and warm diseases. For cramping of the fingers, unable to bend or stretch, moxibustion should be applied above the outer ankle bone with seven punctures. For loss of essence leading to muscle cramping and the genitals retracting into the abdomen, pulling pain; apply moxibustion with fifty punctures at the point slightly inside the inner ankle tendons. Additionally, moxibustion below each fullness with fifty punctures. For the elderly, increase the number, and for children, follow the growth with age. It is also noted: these two points address throat swelling and counterflow, afflictions of the five organs, and all kinds of distention. For cramps, with unbearable pain in the shinbone, perform moxibustion three times on the tendons above the knees. For abdominal distention and cramping, apply moxibustion one inch above the navel with twenty-seven punctures.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>Labor causes coldness to react, resulting in cold blockage in the waist and hips, making it difficult to stretch the legs.

<p>According to the &quot;Treasure of Health,&quot; Zhang Zhongwen transmitted the method of divine moxibustion. For severe pain in the waist and knees, making it hard to turn or sit, and for cold blockages causing muscle spasms in the legs, one cannot turn or bend. Apply moxibustion on the two &quot;wen&quot; points at the back of the knee on both legs, three sessions each. For each leg, use two fires simultaneously, ensuring the moxa reaches the flesh. Initially, there will be pain; with two people blowing on either side until the fire goes out, perform this at noon when the person is calm. The internal organs will move a bit, or may rotate like thunder, leading to rapid recovery. This method is incredibly effective and cannot be measured.</p>
<p>The point Xiezhe reduces pain and tightness near the elbow. Xiezhe is located on the lung meridian, at the horizontal line of the elbow crease.

While attending the dance of the person known as Dai, he passed through Huangru and did not have time to take medicine, so he needled the acupoint at the middle back of both thumbs. Dai said: &quot;There is no illness above the elbow; the only problem is the trembling of both hands, which Left Master refers to as wind-induced minor ailments.&quot; Alternatively, one might needle the Houshu point; the hand Taiyang point; bend the little finger to the end of the line, that is the acupoint.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>The &quot;Ten Books of Li Gao&quot; states: In the winter of the Gui-Mao year, during heavy snowfall, Dong Jianjun from Ling Shou County, while attending to matters in Zhen Ding, unexpectedly experienced a sudden influx of wind. Upon examination, all six pulses were found to be tense, and a strong, wide pulse was present. The symptoms included hand spasms, constipation and dry stools, and a flushed, hot face, indicating the initial onset of wind-cold attacking the body. The limbs, corresponding to the spleen, were affected by the evil of wind-cold, resulting in spasms and rigidity as the wind troubled the minor ailments while the cold remained external. As stated in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; cold causes the muscles to contract, which precisely describes this condition. The individual had a history of alcohol consumption, leading to internal heat accumulating in the digestive tract, causing constipation and a hot face. Internally, the Yangming channels in the hands and feet were influenced by the evil, while externally, the Taiyin spleen channel suffered from wind-cold. I used cinnamon twig and licorice to dispel the cold evil and alleviate the spasms; bitter and cold huanglian was employed to drain the excess and moisten dryness, providing urgent assistance to kidney water. I used sibia and kudzu root to elevate Yang energy, promoting the flow in the Yangming channels of the arms and legs, preventing stagnation. Additionally, cinnamon twig, being acrid and warm, entered the hand Yangming to moisten dryness; I added peony and licorice, specifically to replenish spleen energy, protecting against wind-cold and expelling wood malignancy, consequently benefiting lung metal. I included ginseng to replenish the primary energy for support; adding the body of angelica, I resolved internal urgency and harmonized the blood to moisten dryness, naming the formula &quot;Active Blood Circulation Decoction.&quot; I further instructed the patient to stay in a warm room near the fire, rubbing her hands, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Case of Xue Ji&quot; states: A postpartum woman suffered from muscle spasms and soft arms, with her muscles twitching, all attributed to Qi and blood deficiency. She was treated with the &quot;Shiquan Dabu Decoction&quot; and recovered.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>A woman who was usually affected by phlegm and heat suddenly became faint, experiencing spasms and convulsions, with frequent startles. Her limbs were stiff, and phlegm rose up. This was due to severe dryness in the lung and insufficient blood. She was treated with Qingzao Decoction and Liuwei Pill, and soon recovered.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Yuyi Grass&quot; it is said: Xu Yue was robust, but years ago, after slightly injuring his finger and seeing blood, he washed it with cold water, which caused the blood to coagulate and not disperse. It swelled and produced several pints of pus and blood, and the tendons retracted, resulting in dysfunction of the finger. Recently, between his legs, he found himself feeling cold as autumn moon approached, heavily covering himself, feeling hot on the outside but cold within. Recently, he experienced pain in the tendons from heel to knee, making it inconvenient to travel far.</p>
<p>An old doctor advised him to take Bawei Pill, deeply understanding its significance. Upon examining him, I found his pulse difficult to sense, but the pulses of the liver and lungs were notably strong, indicating a serious condition. Especially in winter, when wood falls and metal is cold, this is particularly unsuitable. The current condition may worsen if not addressed, and one should be cautious with the ingredients of Bawei Pill, especially the cinnamon and aconite.</p>
<p>Why is this? The tendons are linked to the liver. The blood nourishing the tendons could hardly be available due to the previous finger injury, which cannot sustain them. Coupled with anger and frequent movements, liver heat transfers to the tendons, causing stiffness in the large tendons of the feet, leading to discomfort and difficulty in walking. However, the liver governs the lungs, and wood is fearful of metal; if the lungs do not clear, then the energy cannot circulate downward throughout the body.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>When the lung pulse is large, the lung qi is harmed by the heart&#39;s dominion, resulting in obstruction and unclear flow; hence the yang qi cannot descend, leading to cold in the extremities. Although the ailment seems minor, it has already violated the three reversals. Normally, the pulse is fine, but now it is large: one reversal. The liver pulse is large and heat descends, presenting the second reversal. The lung pulse is large and the qi is obstructed upwards, representing the third reversal. If one mistakenly uses cinnamon or aconite to treat it, the heat will become hotter and the obstruction will worsen, leading to atrophy or paralysis within a day. At this juncture, when using medication, it is crucial to be subtle and discerning, as common understanding may not grasp it. The sinews and vessels are short and rigid, the liver qi is internally trapped; thus, one must urgently discuss the method of using metal to conquer wood. By using metal to conquer wood, wood will counter-vigorously thrive, and the sinews will relax. If one does not deeply understand the primordial creation, who can know this? If the metal qi is not obstructed, wood would hasten to fulfill its command without hesitation; how could it dare to resist inwardly? Only if the metal loses its rigidity and turns soft can the wood lose its softness and become rigid. Therefore, when treating this ailment, the foremost principle is to clear the metal. However, clearing the metal first requires clarifying the stomach. If the stomach is not clear, one drinks alcohol, causing heat to be transmitted to the lungs; or consumes rich flavors, resulting in turbid qi being transmitted to the lungs. What medicinal power could possibly fulfill the duty of clearing metal? If the metal is not cleared, it is like having a formidable enemy in front; the general is feeble and cannot expect success. How could one abandon the clearing of metal and instead further assist fire to melt metal, thereby acting in direct opposition to treatment? Such an outcome is bound to be futile.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　内伤等病，是心肺之气已绝于外，必怠惰嗜卧，四肢沉困不收，此乃热伤元气。脾主四肢，既为热所乘，无气以动。经云热伤气，又云热则骨消筋缓，此之谓也。若外伤风寒，是肾肝之气已绝于内，肾主骨为寒，肝主筋为风。自古肾肝之病同一治，以其递相维持也。故经言胆主筋，膀胱主骨是也。或中风，或伤寒，得病之日，便着床枕，非扶不起，筋骨为之疼痛，不能动摇，乃形质之伤。经云寒伤形，又云寒则筋挛骨痛，此之谓也。<br>　　　　　痿纵</p>

<p>　　　　　筋燥</p>
<p>　　经曰：诸濇枯涸，干劲皴揭，皆属于燥。《原病式》曰：经云风、热、火同阳也，寒、燥、湿同阴也。又燥湿少异也。然燥金肺属秋阴而异乎寒湿，故反同其风热也。故火热则金衰而风生，缘风能胜湿，热能耗液而反寒。阳实阴虚，则风热胜于水湿而为燥也。凡人风病，多因热盛，而风燥者为其兼化，以热为其主也。盖肝主于筋，而风气自甚，又燥热加之，则筋大燥也。燥金主于收敛，其脉紧濇，故为病劲强紧急而口噤也。<a id="orig-43p" href="#trans-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>或病燥热太甚而脾胃干涸成消渴者，或风热燥甚，怫郁在表而里气平者，或善伸数欠，筋脉拘急，或时恶寒，筋惕而搐，又或风热燥并而郁甚于里，故烦满而或秘结也。及风癎之发作者，由热甚而风燥，为其兼化，涎溢，胸膈燥铄，而瘈瘲昏冒僵仆也。凡此诸证，皆由热甚而生风燥。病各有异者，由风热燥之微甚不等故也。所谓中风筋缓者，因其风热胜湿而为燥之甚也。然筋缓不收而痿痹，故诸膹郁病痿，皆属于肺金，乃燥之化也。如秋深燥甚，则草木萎落而不收，病之象也。是以掌得血而能持，足得血而能步。夫燥之为病者，血液衰少，不能荣养百骸，故若是也。<a id="orig-44p" href="#trans-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>　　　　　筋痛</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Theory of Vital Energy and Its Connection to Illness</strong></p>
<p>Due to dampness, the head feels wrapped. When damp heat does not dissipate, the large tendons become short and constricted, while the small tendons become loose and elongated; the shortness leads to spasm, while the looseness results in atrophy. </p>
<p><em>Note: The evil of yin-dampness affects the yang aspect and obstructs the bright light, hence the feeling of the head being wrapped. Dampness injures yang energy, leading to the transformation into heat. Yang energy nourishes the tendons when it is gentle; when yang is damaged and cannot nourish the tendons, the large tendons become short and constricted, while the small tendons become loose and elongated. The large tendons connect within the joints, thus they shorten due to accumulated heat. The small tendons are connected outside the bones and flesh, thus they become loose due to dampness. Shortness leads to sudden contraction and spasms, while length leads to excessive relaxation and atrophy.</em></p>
<p>The essence of yang energy is such that great anger causes the vital essence to become depleted and the blood to stagnate upwards, leading to feelings of faintness and injury to the tendons, which may cause them to not be able to bear weight.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When great anger arises, the yang energy reverses upward, disrupting the movement of energy within the body. Blood, following this energy, rises and both qi and blood flow upward, leading one to experience faintness. The blood vessels nourish muscles and bones and benefit the joints; when yang energy is injured and blood flows backward, it harms the muscles and bones. When the muscles are injured and slackened, the limbs feel as if they cannot be freely used. </p>
<p>Excessively spicy flavors weaken the muscles and tendons, leading to a lack of spirit. Therefore, it is important to harmonize the five flavors, ensuring bones are aligned and muscles are supple, allowing qi and blood to flow and the pores to be tight. In this way, the essence of bone qi becomes refined, adherence to the proper method ensures longevity and aligns with the mandate of heaven.</p>
<p>When the metal energy is overly strong, it injures the liver energy, resulting in slackened muscles and tendons. The kidneys store essence and govern the bones, while the liver stores blood and regulates the tendons. Wind invading with excessive energy injures the liver, leading to the loss of essence. Thus, harmonizing the five flavors ensures bones are aligned, muscles are pliable, and pores are tightly closed.</p>
<p>Therefore, those skilled in healing first treat the skin and hair, then the muscles and flesh, next the tendons and vessels, after that the six hollow organs, and finally the five viscera. Treating the five viscera involves a state of half-life and half-death. </p>
<p>When pathogens invade the interior and do not resolve through the hollow organs, they affect the viscera. If the pathogens are within the qi channels of the five viscera, there is still a chance for recovery and life; but if they affect the viscera, it leads to death. Thus, it is said to be half-life and half-death.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on the Six Organs and Their Manifestations</h3>
<p>The liver is the foundation of the ultimate relaxation and the dwelling of the soul. Its manifestation is in the nails, and its substance resides in the tendons, giving rise to blood and qi. Its taste is sour, and its color is green; this represents the lesser yang within yang, connecting with the energy of spring. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The nails are the remnants of the tendons, hence their manifestation is in the nails while their substance is in the tendons.</p>
<h3>Treatise on the Generation of the Five Organs</h3>
<p>The liver correlates with the tendons; its glory is the nails; it primarily governs the lungs. Excessive consumption of pungent food leads to taut tendons and withered nails. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pungent refers to a metal flavor, and overindulgence harms the liver, leading to contracted tendons and withered nails. All tendons belong to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tendons arise from the bones, connected between the joints.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Fundamental Essence of Pulses</h3>
<p>The Emperor asked: &quot;What is the cause of abscesses, muscle cramps, and bone pain?&quot; Qibo replied: &quot;These are swellings caused by cold qi and changes due to the eight winds.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This refers to the evils of wind and cold during the four seasons, transforming into heat diseases such as abscesses and cramps.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Human Vitality</h3>
<p>The true essence of the organs disperses within the liver; the liver stores the qi of the tendons.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

<p>The true essence of the organ is the spirit it houses. The spirit resides in the organ as the liver, and in the body as the tendons, indicating that the true spirit of the organ disperses in the liver and governs the energy that stores in the tendons. </p>
<p>Wind is the chief of all diseases. The kidneys communicate with the heart, leading to ailments that affect the tendons and vessels, known as &quot;spasm.&quot; At this time, both moxibustion and medicine can be used. If left untreated for ten days, death is inevitable. </p>
<p>The heart governs the blood vessels and is associated with fire; when the fire is overly intense, the tendons and vessels become dry and constricted, leading to stiffness in the hands and feet. In cases of acute danger, moxibustion and medicine can still be employed, meaning one should not abandon treatment due to severity. If untreated for ten days, death is likely. </p>
<p>When food energy enters the stomach, it spreads essence to the liver and moist energy to the tendons.</p>
<p>Sour flavors affect the tendons, and one suffering from tendon disease should avoid consuming too much sour food. </p>
<p>The liver is related to the tendons; prolonged activity can harm the tendons. </p>
<p>Basic suffering results in joy, with conditions arising in the tendons, which should be treated with pressing and guiding methods. When physical labor exhausts the body, it injures the tendons; if one&#39;s aspirations are relaxed but the blood vessels are not ill, then treatment through pressing and guiding is employed to nourish the tendons and achieve stability.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Qi Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>The spleen transfers cold to the liver, causing abscesses and muscle spasms.<br>[Note: The liver governs blood; cold causes blood to coagulate. The Classic states: When the nourishing qi cannot circulate, it causes abscesses. The liver governs muscles, hence the spasms.]</p>
<p><strong>Treatise on Bi Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>The combination of wind, cold, and dampness creates Bi syndrome. In spring, those who encounter this suffer from muscle obstruction, and if it persists, they may be further affected by evils that reside within the liver. The Emperor said: In cases of Bi, some die, while others experience prolonged pain, and some recover easily. What is the reason for this? Qi Bo answered: Those who suffer deep internal injury die; those who linger between the muscles and bones experience prolonged pain; those who remain in the skin recover easily.<br>[Note: The evils become lodged in the organs when the organ qi is sufficiently strong, preventing them from moving. If the spirit qi dissipates, then the evil converges in the organs and causes death. Those who linger between muscles and bones without settling deeper experience prolonged pain; those remaining in the skin disperse easily with the qi.]</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: Why is it that Bi syndrome does not cause pain? Qi Bo replied: When it is in the bones, it feels heavy; in the vessels, blood congeals and does not flow; in the muscles, it cannot bend or stretch; in the flesh, it loses sensitivity; in the skin, it causes coldness. Therefore, when these five conditions are present, there is no pain.<br>[Note: If the disease manifests in form without harming the qi, one may observe the heaviness of bone obstruction, the stagnation of blood in the vessels, the inability to bend and stretch in the muscles, the insensitivity in the flesh, and the cold in the skin, thereby presenting these five clinical signs without pain.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>[Note: The gallbladder is an organ that holds essential fluids and corresponds to the muscles, which are the fascia throughout the body, nourished by the vital juices from the organs. The gallbladder is attached to the liver; when liver qi is hot, bile leaks, causing bitterness in the mouth. When bile leaks, the fascia cannot be nourished and dries up; when the fascia is dry, it becomes tight and cramp results in muscle weakness.] </p>
<p>Endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires lead to indulgence in external fantasies, overindulging in sexual activity causes the foundational muscles to loosen, resulting in muscle weakness and even seminal emission. Thus, muscle weakness originates from the liver, manifesting internally. </p>

<p>The Emperor said: When a person has a pulse that is excessively wide, with tense muscles appearing, what kind of illness is this? Qibo replied: This is called &quot;tendon rash.&quot; Such a person will have a tense abdomen, and if there are signs of white or black, the illness is severe. </p>
<p>[Note: The chong pulse governs the permeation of streams and valleys and connects with the yangming channel, which is why muscle disease corresponds with abdominal tension. Among the twelve channels, only when the hand taiyin is severely affected does it lead to convulsions, a tight abdomen, and vomiting blood. If the foot shaoyin&#39;s muscle disease is severe, it will result in death without treatment. Therefore, seeing signs of white or black indicates a severe illness.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Major Oddities</strong></p>
<p>When the heart pulse is full and large, and there are convulsions and muscle spasms; when the liver pulse is small and tense, there are also convulsions and muscle spasms. </p>
<p>[Note: The heart is a fire organ; when the fire heat is excessive, the pulse becomes large and convulsions occur. The liver governs muscles and blood; when small, it indicates deficiency, and when tense, it suggests coldness. Thus, a deficiency of the liver leads to coldness that fails to nourish the muscles, resulting in spasms and convulsions.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Skin and Surface</strong></p>
<p>When pathogens invade the channels, they create a sensation of deficiency that leads to sinking. If they linger between the muscles and bones, an excess of cold will cause muscle spasms and bone pain; an excess of heat will cause muscles to relax and bones to weaken, flesh to rot and break down, and hair to become straight and fall out. </p>

<p>Accumulated cold lingers in the dwelling, the nourishing and protective energies cannot reside; muscles contract and tendons shrink, the ribs and elbows cannot extend, resulting in internal bone stiffness and external numbness, termed &quot;insufficiency.&quot; This is due to the great cold flowing in the valleys. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Accumulated cold lingers, preventing the nourishing and protective energies from cohabiting; cold evils stagnate and do not receive the righteous qi to harmonize, causing the flesh to roll and muscles to contract. The ribs and elbows are the joints of muscles and bones, hence they cannot stretch; evils are closed off outside, resulting in internal bone stiffness; the internal nourishing and protective energies are inverted, leading to external numbness, termed &quot;insufficiency.&quot; The excess of hot evils is categorized as surplus, while the cold nature is dense and stagnant, thus leading to insufficiency. This great cold evil flows in the valleys, causing illnesses in the muscles and bones.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Reversal of the Four Seasonal Treatments</strong></p>
<p>When Shaoyang is in excess, it leads to muscle stiffness and fullness in the flanks; when there is insufficiency, it leads to liver stiffness. If slippery, it causes liver wind hernia; if stagnant, it causes accumulation with tense muscles and eye ailments. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The pulse and qi are dispersed in the skin and hair, again relying on the flesh governed by Taiyin, the tendons governed by Shaoyang, and the bones governed by Taiyang, connecting internally to the five organs. Thus, when there is excess outside, it results in muscle stiffness, tendon stiffness, and bone stiffness; when insufficient and trapped internally, it leads to spleen stiffness, liver stiffness, and kidney stiffness. When qi is excessive internally and transforms into heat, it leads to hernia; when blood is excessive internally and transforms into cold, it leads to accumulation.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The lesser yang rules the heavens; the initial energy consists of the three energies, which govern the two types of fire. The energy of the second corresponds to the damp earth of the greater yin. Red rashes refer to spots caused by heat from fire manifesting externally. The red patches indicate a desire to move internally after appearing outside. Nausea and convulsive symptoms arise from the internal energy of damp earth. Sores and swellings, along with various other symptoms, also arise from the influences of damp heat, as they move from above downwards and from the outside inwards.</p>
<p>In the case of the jué yīn at the spring, when the external energy is excessive, the major joints become restricted; internally, there are convulsions and stiffness, while externally there is discomfort.

<p>The major joints refer to the twelve joints of hands and feet. The jué yīn at the spring, influenced by external energies, is first affected by the dry metal of the yang ming, while the jué yīn governs the tendons, and dryness affects joint mobility. Then, the external energy is influenced by the cold water of the tai yang. The tai yang is the chief energy of all yangs, and the softness of yang nourishes tendons; however, if cold energy infiltrates internally, it affects the tai yang, leading to internal convulsions and stiffness, known as the &quot;痓&quot; syndrome.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Here is the translated text:</p>
<p>If one is once wealthy but suddenly loses all resources, it greatly harms their spirit and soul. Therefore, the heart governs the vessels, and the liver governs the tendons; it is as if they have been severed, which injures the blood vessels of the left side. However, the spleen on the right side remains uninjured, allowing the body still to function. The vital energy governed by the lungs and kidneys has not been harmed, thus it continues to grow without ceasing. Though the illness initially arises from the yin, over time it will also affect the yang. This results in the blood of the heart and liver being harmed while accumulating in the left, leaving it thin within the qi division and returning to the yang. Both the blood and qi on the left and right are harmed, leading to the accumulation of pus and cold heat. The injury to the yin results in the thinning of the yang, which causes pus to accumulate between yin and yang, cold and heat. When both yin and yang blood and qi are harmed, if one tonifies yang, the yin will deplete; if one purges yin, the yang will be lost. In such cases, one may only drink sweet medicines and should not use moxibustion or acupuncture. If a rough practitioner, lacking knowledge, hastily needles the yin and yang, it results in the dissolution of the body, injuring the splenic qi, and causing the limbs to cramp, which leads to the exhaustion of gastric qi.</p>
<p>In cases of acute heart vessel issues, one experiences convulsions. The heart is the fire organ, thus when it is severely cold, convulsions occur. The joints of the hands and feet are where the spirit and qi move in and out; cold injures the spirit and qi, therefore resulting in convulsions. When the liver pulse is weak and lingering, it leads to convulsions and muscle rigidity. This occurs due to deficiency of liver qi accompanied by cold, as the liver governs the tendons. When the spleen pulse is acute, it also results in convulsions.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Notes:</strong> When the sudden contraction occurs, it causes urgency; when there is relaxation, it leads to looseness. The spleen governs the limbs, hence urgency is associated with sudden contractions.</p>
<p><strong>Main Body of the Text</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Spirit:</strong> When the liver feels sorrow and is stirred, it harms the soul. If the soul is harmed, one becomes mad, forgetting and lacking focus; without focus, there is disorder. This leads to the body becoming contracted and muscles rigid, the ribs unable to lift, hair becoming withered, and complexion fading, resulting in death during autumn. <strong>Notes:</strong> Sorrow is an emotion of the lungs. If the liver becomes agitated by sorrow, it harms the soul stored in the liver. When the soul is harmed, one becomes mad and forgets. The liver governs the muscles, and if emotions harm the body, this results in physical symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>On the Meridians:</strong> When the Qi of the foot&#39;s Jueyin is severed, the muscles become disconnected. The Jueyin refers to the liver meridian; the liver is the source of the muscles. Muscles converge at the reproductive organs and extend to the root of the tongue. Therefore, if the pulse is not nourished, muscles become tense; if tense, they affect the tongue and the reproductive organs, leading to blue lips and a rolled tongue. If the reproductive organs shrink, the muscles die first, leading to a decline in the metal (lungs) and death of the wood (liver) as metal surpasses wood. <strong>Notes:</strong> The Qi of the foot&#39;s Jueyin governs the muscles, hence if the Qi is severed, the muscles also become disconnected. The Jueyin refers to the liver meridian, which governs the muscles, representing the connection between the Qi of the meridian and the liver. The convergence at the reproductive organs signifies the gathering of muscle energy, with connections extending to the tongue. If the pulse is not nourishing the muscles, they become tense, rolling the tongue and shrinking the reproductive organs. When the Qi of the Jueyin is severed, the muscles die first, the metal&#39;s decline leading to the death of wood, resulting in the exhaustion of the liver&#39;s wood Qi.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

Its branches connect at the outer side of the calf, then from the inner side of the popliteal region, up to the hip, and flank the spine along the back of the head. One branch connects at the base of the tongue; another connects at the occiput and links the higher portions to the face, connecting at the nose; yet another branch extends to the area beneath the jaw. Another branch runs from behind the armpit to the shoulder joint; another branch enters under the armpit, goes up through the axilla, and connects at the clavicle; a branch extends out of the axilla and exits at the jaw. </p>
<p>Conditions related to this channel manifest as pain and swelling in the little toe, cramping in the knee, stiffness in the back, tightness in the neck, inability to lift the shoulder, and pain in the axillary area within the axilla, making it difficult to sway left or right. Treatment involves burning needles for acupuncture, focusing on the areas where pain is felt, and using specific acupressure points known as &quot;zhongchun bi&quot; (mid-spring obstruction). </p>
<p>The &quot;burning needle&quot; technique is akin to seizing and thrusting the needle without following the natural flow of entry and exit. &quot;Knowing&quot; refers to the harmonious flow of blood and qi, allowing for proper movement. Choosing points based on pain is about targeting acupoints directly associated with the area of pain. The outer surface (skin) is considered yang, while muscles and bones are yin; when there is a blockage in the yin, it is termed obstruction, where blood and qi are stagnant and cause pain. The month of February corresponds to the left foot&#39;s Taiyang channel, hence the name &quot;mid-spring obstruction.&quot; The muscles of the hands and feet relate to the four seasons and the twelve months of the year; therefore, diseases also arise according to the seasons and are not merely due to external factors.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>(Note: The term &quot;crossing of the sinews&quot; refers to the intersection of the connective tissues from left and right.

<p>(Note: The tendons of the foot Yangming run alongside the mouth and beneath the eyes; the tendons of the hand Taiyang end at the jaw and connect to the outer canthus of the eye. Therefore, if the left tendon is taut, the mouth deviates to the left, and one should treat the left side; if the right tendon is taut, the mouth deviates to the right, so treatment should focus on the right. If the left eye cannot fully see, the ailment is on the left; likewise for the right eye. If both eyes are strained, both sides are affected. Thus, the treatment follows the aforementioned principles, while the condition remains differentiated by left and right.)</p>

<p><strong>The Treatise on Pathogenic Factors</strong></p>
<p>In the earth there are forests and trees, in humans there are tensions in the muscles. </p>
<p>When there is a pathogen affecting the lungs and heart, its qi stays at both elbows; when there is a pathogen in the liver, its qi resides at both armpits; when there is a pathogen in the spleen, its qi remains at both thighs; when there is a pathogen in the kidneys, its qi lingers at both knees. </p>
<p>All these eight areas of deficiency are chambers of the joints, pathways of true qi, and places where blood circulation occurs. Pathogenic qi and stasis of blood cannot settle; if they do settle, they harm the meridians, and the joints and mechanisms cannot flex and extend, hence the occurrence of cramps. </p>
<p>[Note: The areas of both elbows, armpits, thighs, and knees represent the junctions of joints, from which the spirit and qi of the heart emerge. If there is a pathogen in the five organs, qi will remain here and cannot disperse. The pathways of true qi refer to the meridians of the five organs, each passing through these areas. If pathogenic qi stays, it injures the meridians, meaning that the pathogen lingers in the skin and does not depart, thus harming the meridians. The notion of chambers of the joints pertains to the intersections of joints, from which the blood and qi of the five organs emerge into the flesh and skin, without entering the blood vessels. Therefore, if there is a pathogen in the five organs, qi will remain here. If externally affected by pathogenic qi, stasis of blood will reside here, leading to an inability of the joints and mechanisms to flex and extend, which causes cramps.]<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

<p>The intrusion of external evils into the body is profound; cold and heat clash, lingering for long periods and becoming entrenched within. If cold prevails over heat, it results in bone pain and muscle atrophy; if heat overcomes cold, it leads to rotting flesh and decaying muscles, resulting in pus and internal injury to the bones. Internal injury to the bones leads to bone erosion. If there is prior ailment in the tendons, they become bent and unable to stretch, with the evil qi residing in between and not resolving, resulting in tendon spasms. </p>
<p><em>Note: The clash of cold and heat refers to the interplay of yin and yang within the physical form. When the form is damaged, it causes qi to be ill; when qi is injured, it results in illness of the form.

If these signs are absent, it is not.</p>
<p>The liver pulse indicates the diagnosis of the liver. The liver and gallbladder together form the repository of cleanliness, hence the cleanliness in appearance. The liver is the general&#39;s organ, thus the greenish face and anger correspond to the liver&#39;s nature.

<p>The sinews converge at Yanglingquan.</p>
<p>This pertains to the lesser yang sinews, which end at Yanglingquan, situated one inch below the knee on its outer side. Furthermore, the gallbladder is paired with the liver; the liver governs the sinews, thus it is known as the meeting point of the sinews.</p>

<p><strong>About Muscular Diseases: Good and Evil</strong></p>
<p>If the heart pulse is extremely urgent, it leads to convulsions; if slightly urgent, it causes pain in the heart that leads to pain in the waist and back, and one cannot eat. If the spleen pulse is extremely urgent, it leads to convulsions; if slightly urgent, it causes obstruction in the diaphragm, preventing food from entering and causing it to be expelled. When the tendons are severed and the soul is startled, resulting in faintness and fear, with blue hands, feet, and nails, and incessant shouting, one will die in eight or nine days. Muscular numbness arises from excessive anger, shouting at inappropriate times, rushing while walking, or excessive indulgence harming the liver, leading to the loss of its energy. Consequently, cold and heat invade, persisting for a long time and flowing into the tendons, causing tension that cannot be relieved, hence the term &quot;muscular numbness.&quot; It is necessary to invigorate the blood to nourish the liver, warm the energy to support the kidneys, and then take medicated pills or decoctions. If the treatment aligns with the underlying principles, one will recover naturally; otherwise, it will cause harm. The pulse will be tight, string-like, urgent, and powerful at the left guan position.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Manual by Wang Shuhe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis for Muscular Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The song of the liver pulse says: Tightness is due to muscular tension in slight measure. It also states: If it is greatly floating and the muscles weak, the body lacks strength; encountering this, one may feel the entire body become limp. Another verse mentions: If there are twenty-nine weak pulses concealed, the internal organs and tendons are completely obstructed. It further adds: If the pulse overflows at the guan position and responds at the inch position, the visual heaviness feels weighty, accompanied by tendon pain. The spleen pulse song states: Tightness in the spleen leads to pain, and also involves muscular tension causing restraint. One desires to vomit but cannot; the pressure remains unrelieved.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong><br><strong>(Tang Dynasty - Sun Simiao)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Muscle Extremity</strong></p>
<p>Muscle extremity primarily concerns the liver. The liver corresponds to the muscles, and the muscles are connected to the liver. When the liver is ill, it manifests in the muscles. It is also said: when one encounters an illness in spring, it is related to muscle blockage. If the blockage persists, it can be affected by external pathogenic factors, which reside in the liver, leading to the inward flow of yang energy and the outward flow of yin energy. When yin energy escapes, it becomes deficient; when deficient, the muscles become weak. Weak muscles lead to excessive sorrow, and a pale, discolored appearance can be seen below the eyes. If there is damage from cold, the muscles cannot move; the fingers and nails all hurt, and there is a tendency for muscle cramping. The source of this is being exposed to wind on a spring day, resulting in wind affecting the muscles, indicating liver deficiency with wind. If the yang energy rises internally, it becomes substantial; when substantial, the muscles are solid. Solid muscles can lead to excessive anger and dryness in the throat; heat injuries can cause coughing, which leads to pain in the sides and an inability to turn, resulting in a fullness and pain in the muscles of the legs. Hence, it is said to be a solid wind affecting the liver. Therefore, treat it according to its lightness or heaviness, reflect on its deficiency or fullness. Examine its yin and yang to differentiate between soft and hard. When yang disease applies to yin, treat the yin disease with yang. Those skilled in treating illnesses address issues within the skin, muscles, and meridians first; next, treat the six fu organs. If one treats the five zang organs, the patient finds themselves in a state between life and death.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Turning of the Muscles</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: &quot;Turning&quot; means reversing. When hot qi becomes dry and scorches the muscles, it causes cramps and pain, as fire is the master of burning and drying movement. Some mistakenly believe that cold is the guest in the muscles. However, although cold is associated with contraction, it only causes reversal and inhibition, making movement difficult; how could it cause the turning of the muscles? &quot;Turning&quot; refers to movement. Yang is active while Yin is still, which proves heat. </p>
<p>The turning of the muscles often stems from excessive heat disrupting the body leading to vomiting and diarrhea. When the spleen and stomach weaken, the liver wood becomes excessive, and heat dries out the muscles, thus causing the turning of the muscles. Generally, thirst indicates heat. In cases of disruption and turning of the muscles without thirst, such instances are rare. Sometimes it does not arise from vomiting or diarrhea, but from external cold invading, leading to the closure of the pores, with yang qi stagnating, causing internal heat and dryness in the muscles, which results in the turning of the muscles. </p>
<p>Therefore, for all cases of turning of the muscles, using hot water to soak the area facilitates the opening and expulsion of the pores. When yang qi disperses, healing occurs. Because healing through hot water leads to improvement, people commonly mistakenly attribute it to cold. The hot qi, dry and scorching in the muscles, leads to turning and pain. Concerning wind associated with the liver, in severe cases, there may be continuous vomiting, with the added heat causing diarrhea, indicating a predominance of dampness. If three types of qi mix together, it results in disruption.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Contraction and Urgency</strong></p>
<p>The body is cold, unable to be warmed by a heavy coat; the kidney essence is dried up and not functioning. The marrow is insufficient, the tendons weak, and thus the frozen limbs lead to contractions and urgency. The formula &quot;Fuzi Decoction&quot; is indicated for this.</p>
<p>For abdominal pain from gu (a type of poison), the kidneys affect the heart, and the tendons and vessels pull together resulting in urgency. The essence is scant, and the tendons are not nourished, causing urgency. The &quot;Jianzhong Decoction&quot; with modifications is indicated for this.</p>
<p>When the pulse is excessively rapid, and the tendons are tight, this manifests in the abdomen and must correspondingly be urgent. A rapid pulse is also a sign of deficiency; when the tendons are evident, it is referred to by name. The &quot;Baitzi Ren Powder&quot; is indicated for this.</p>
<p>All heat-related confusion and conditions belong to fire. When heat prevails, it causes muddled confusion and obscurity. &quot;Muddled&quot; refers to confusion.

<p>When heat overcomes, it clashes with wind, affecting the meridians, causing wind to act and remain unsettled. The interaction of wind and fire leads to heat-induced confusion and the arising of contractions. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Strength and Weakness</strong></p>
<p>The texts state: Various sudden muscular contractions, joint pains, and abdominal urgency with muscle tightness are all due to sudden wind disturbances. &quot;Strong&quot; refers to strength that is powerful yet not gentle. &quot;Straight&quot; signifies strong and forceful muscles. &quot;Joint pain&quot; pertains to the pressure on the joints. A firm support with tense muscles leads to pain. &quot;Contraction&quot; indicates tightening. &quot;Deviate&quot; means to go awry. It is said that muscle tightness and abdominal urgency are due to abnormalities and illness. Dried metal corresponds to contraction and tightness; when wind and wood are at play, they cause illness, reflecting the transformations of dried metal, and excessive conditions can harm the internal organs and lead to control issues. Additionally, wind can overcome dampness leading to dryness, and thus, in the tenth month, wind illnesses become severe. Loose muscles are indicative of extreme dryness. Therefore, all severe wind conditions are also associated with dryness.</p>
<p>Contractions and stiffness in the muscles, strong yet not gentle, are due to the tranquility of the earth. Yin contractions are termed soft spasms, while yang contractions are called hard spasms. Excessive conditions are harmful, leading to internal complications, hence extreme dampness can counter wind transformations. However, those that combine transformations may show false appearances, and in reality, they are not wind-related. When thoughts are endless, and one’s desires remain unfulfilled, leading to excessive external fantasies and inappropriate behaviors, it can result in muscle weakness, and also lead to implications of sexual indulgence. Excessive behaviors associate with white substances in indulgence, which subsequently lead to weakness and exhaustion; therefore, the &quot;Secret True Pill&quot; is recommended for treatment.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

Either contracting or extending, when in motion and ceaseless, it is referred to as tetany, commonly known as &quot;spasm.&quot; The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; states: when the muscles and tendons are drawn and tense, it is called tetany. &quot;Tetany&quot; implies something like a tight fit, while &quot;spasm&quot; suggests something like a loose release. When in motion, it&#39;s relaxed; when at rest, it&#39;s tense. This indicates that the tense condition is termed tetany, and the relaxed condition is called spasm, which is quite clear.</p>
<p>Tetany and spasm arise from wind disorders, and seizures can also manifest as tetany. In the case of cold damage leading to tetany, it indicates that pathogenic heat has reached an extreme. If heat is intense, it can provoke the wind, impacting the meridians. The wind is active, causing the limbs to be in a state of tetany and unrest. Thus, when wind warmth meets fire, the result is a mild yellow appearance; if severe, it resembles a frantic seizure, sometimes resulting in tetany, indicating the intensity of the heat. When the condition of cold damage progresses to tetany, the disease has advanced significantly, making it hard to treat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: when the yang stage concludes, the eyes are averted, and tetany occurs; there is a cessation of sweat, which is large and pearl-like, sticking to the body without flowing. This displays that the condition of tetany signifies a disease that has progressed. There may also be stubbornness in the limbs, where they move restlessly but lack the strength to flex or extend. This is a sign of liver deficiency. Although the symptoms of tetany can be difficult to manage, if one can eliminate wind and clear heat with appropriate medications to diminish the intense heat, there is a chance for recovery. However, if one recklessly applies cautery or administers medications to induce perspiration, they may face imminent death.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Muscle Spasms</strong></p>
<p>How can we clarify the understanding of muscle spasms caused by cold damage? The symptoms of cold damage include headache, body aches, aversion to cold, and fever, which are definitive indicators. When there are prominent muscle spasms and twitching, it is essential that excessive sweating leads to a loss of Yang energy. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that Yang energy nourishes the spirit when it is pure and nourishes the muscles when it is flexible. Excess sweating leads to a depletion of fluids, causing Yang energy to become excessively deficient and the muscles to lose their nourishment, resulting in spasms and twitching.</p>
<p>In cases of Taiyang disease with weak pulses and sweating combined with aversion to wind, one must not take the Da Qinglong Decoction, for doing so would cause counteractions and lead to muscle spasms and twitching, which is a reversal. If the movement of Qi is on the left, one must not induce sweating. Inducing sweating would cause dizziness, persistent sweating, and muscle spasms. Observing this, it is evident that muscle spasms and twitching arise from excessive sweating leading to a loss of Yang energy, which is visibly deficient. Even though this is a reversal, it should be understood that it stems from sweating leading to a loss of Yang energy and exterior deficiency. Treatment should focus on warming the channels and boosting Yang energy.</p>
<p>If there are also symptoms from vomiting, purging, and sweating, resulting in both interior and exterior deficiency, the situation is different from that caused solely by sweating. The classic text states: after vomiting and purging in cold damage, if there is excessive deficiency with restlessness, a markedly weak pulse, and symptoms persisting for eight or nine days—such as a feeling of fullness below the heart, pain below the ribs, and Qi surging up to the throat, leading to dizziness and muscle pulsations—this can result in prolonged weakness. This scenario is a severe form of reversal. </p>
<p>The classic text notes: if the movement of Qi is on the left, one must not induce sweating; doing so will cause dizziness, persistent sweating, and muscle spasms. This indicates that excess sweating affects the liver Qi.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Distinguishing Internal and External Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Internal injuries and illnesses arise when the vital energy of the heart and lungs is depleted from the exterior, leading to lethargy and a desire to lie down, with the limbs feeling heavy and unable to move. This is due to heat damaging the original vital energy. The spleen governs the limbs, and when affected by heat, it lacks the energy to move. The classics say heat injures qi and also that heat causes bones to dissolve and muscles to slacken; this is what is meant. </p>
<p>In contrast, external injuries from wind and cold occur when the vital energies of the kidneys and liver are depleted internally. The kidneys govern the bones and are affected by cold, while the liver governs the muscles and is affected by wind. Since ancient times, conditions of the kidneys and liver have been treated similarly, as they mutually support each other. Thus, the classics state that the gallbladder governs the muscles, and the bladder governs the bones. Whether from a stroke or from catching a cold, once the illness strikes, one may fall into bed, unable to rise; it is not merely a lack of strength, but pain in the muscles and bones resulting in immobility, indicating injury to the physical form. The classics say cold damages the physical condition, and also that cold causes muscle cramps and bone pain; this is what is meant.</p>
<p><strong>Atrophy and Stretching</strong></p>
<p>Heat in the liver leads to muscle atrophy, causing the muscles to become slackened. All forms of atrophy belong to the upper regions, indicating that the root of the illness lies in the lungs. Therefore, it must first arise in the lungs, after which the heat spreads to the five organs, resulting in various forms of atrophy.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Muscle Disease Should Be Treated According to the Classics</strong></p>
<p>Muscle cramps and spasms lead to the contraction of the yin, with both legs cramping; these symptoms belong to the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian. When spasms are severe, they belong to the Hand Jueyin and Taiyin.</p>
<p><strong>Spasm Treatment</strong></p>
<p>For continuous spasms, men should use their hands to pull the yin, and women should use their hands to draw the breast towards either side; this is a wonderful method from the &quot;Thousand Golds.&quot; Such spasms are linked to blood heat; one should take Siwu Decoction with added wine, Scutellaria, safflower, Atractylodes, and Nanking star. If there is cold, abdominal fullness and pain, limbs stiff and tense, and spasms causing diarrhea, one should take the Lizhong Decoction with added fresh Aconite and Cinnamon.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Dryness</strong></p>
<p>The text states: “All that is withered and drained dry, with firm tendons and cracked dry skin, pertains to dryness.” &quot;Yuan Disease Form&quot; states: &quot;The classics say wind, heat, and fire are all yang; cold, dryness, and dampness are all yin.” Dryness and dampness are somewhat different. However, drying metal corresponds to autumn yin, which differs from cold dampness; thus, it reacts similarly to wind heat. When fire is hot, metal weakens and wind arises, because wind can overcome dampness, and heat can deplete fluids and lead to cold. When yang is strong and yin is weak, then wind heat triumphs over water dampness and causes dryness. In general, wind diseases in people arise mostly due to excess heat, wherein wind-dryness coexists, with heat being the dominant factor. The liver governs the tendons; when wind is excessive and combined with dryness and heat, the tendons become exceedingly dry. Dry metal is responsible for contraction, resulting in tense and urgent pulses, leading to muscle stiffness and mouth closure.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Some may suffer from excessive dryness and heat, leading to the dehydration of the spleen and stomach, resulting in thirst; others may experience severe wind-heat, which remains at the surface while the internal energy is balanced; some may find it hard to stretch and feel tightness in their sinews; at times, they may feel cold with twitching muscles. In addition, the combination of wind, heat, and dryness may cause significant stagnation internally, leading to restlessness and possibly constipation. In cases of wind invasion, it can emerge from excessive heat and dryness, transforming into phlegm, causing dryness in the chest and diaphragm, leading to symptoms of dizziness, faintness, and collapse. All these manifestations arise from the excess of heat that creates dryness. The variations in illnesses are due to the differing degrees of wind, heat, and dryness. The phenomenon of muscle relaxation in cases of wind is caused by the predominance of wind-heat over dampness, leading to pronounced dryness. Under such circumstances, relaxation of the muscles results in weakness and numbness, hence various symptoms of stagnation and weakness are related to the lung metal, indicating the transformation of dryness. When autumn deepens and dryness intensifies, grasses and trees wither and do not thrive, reflecting the signs of illness. Thus, when blood is sufficient, one can grasp and maintain strength; when blood is ample in the legs, one can walk. The illness of dryness leads to diminished blood and fluids, which cannot nourish the body’s structure, resulting in these phenomena.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The Suwen&quot; states: if the heart pulse is extremely rapid, it indicates epilepsy. This is a deficiency of heart fire and should be treated with a heart-boosting medicine like Niu Huang San. &quot;The Ling Shu&quot; mentions: if the heart pulse is full and large, there is muscular contraction indicating real heat in the heart; it should be treated by draining heart fire with medicine like Liqing Wan. A rapid and small liver pulse also indicates muscular contraction, implying liver deficiency; it should be treated with Xu Duan Wan. If the liver pulse is strong, one should first treat the spleen, and it is advisable to use Jia Wei Jian Zhong Tang.</p>
<p>&quot;The Suwen&quot; also states: if the spleen pulse is extremely rapid, it indicates epilepsy, as spleen deficiency leads to the liver overpowering it, hence it is necessary to strengthen the earth and drain the liver wood. Epilepsy with persistent profuse sweating indicates deficiency, while absence of sweat with appetite shows excess.</p>
<p>There are two types of epilepsy related to Qi: One is fire. The classics say: when fire is constrained, people suffer from vomiting and epilepsy. It also says: when Shaoyang is affected, there is a violent reaction leading to epilepsy. Furthermore, it states: when Shaoyang governs the sky, and the guest prevails, epilepsy results. The second type is water. The texts say: when Yangming governs the sky, dry qi descends, and wood qi follows, people suffer from rib pain and red eyes, with trembling. It also mentions that when soil is excessive, and moisture flows, people suffer from leg weakness and epilepsy. Additionally, when Taiyin returns, there is severe pain at the crown of the head, and epilepsy is especially pronounced.</p>

However, there is no method to withdraw blood, and one cannot avoid acupuncture; otherwise, stagnant blood attacks the heart and immediate rescue is necessary.

<p><strong>Muscle Tightening</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: Winds causing dizziness, joint pain, and muscle tightening are attributed to the Qi of the Wind-Wood of the Jue Yin. From the Greater Cold to the Lesser Fullness, the positions of the Wind and Wood are governed by the Fire. Wind is active, good at causing rapid changes; Wood flourishes and gives rise to Fire. Wind and Fire belong to Yang and often lead to rigidity; thus, the Yangming Dry Metal is associated with contraction and tightening. When Wind and Wood cause illness, they manifest as a transformation into Dry Metal. Overindulgence can lead to harm from the excessive and consequently is curtailed, suggesting that Wood, when it reaches its peak, resembles Metal. Furthermore, Wind can overcome Dampness and thus becomes Dry; when Wind illness appears severe, it results in muscle tightening, the extreme of dryness. Such symptoms are indeed caused by the dominance of Wind, treated with cooling methods, and it is not suitable to use cinnamon or aconite. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the midst of following the patterns of the Six Classics for evidence, adjustments are made incrementally, and it is not convenient to use the entire prescriptions as a standard. For instance, if there is no sweating from the sun (Taiyang), increase the amounts of ephedra (Mahuang), apricot kernels (Xingren), and ledebouriella root (Fangfeng) in the base prescription; if there is sweating and aversion to wind, increase the amounts of cinnamon (Guizhi), peony (Shaoyao), and apricot kernels. If in Yangming there is no sweating, and the body is hot but not averse to wind, add gypsum (Shigao),zhi mu (Zhi Mu), and licorice (Gancao) to the base prescription; if there is sweating, body heat but not aversion to wind, add kudzu root (Gegen), cinnamon, and scutellaria (Huangqin). If the sun is present without sweating and the body feels cool, add aconite (Fuzhi), dried ginger (Ganjing), and licorice. In Shaoyin when there is sweating without heat, add cinnamon, aconite, and licorice. </p>
<p>In cases of windstroke without these four signs, if the Six Classics are confused, pertaining to Shaoyang and Jueyin, or if there is joint pain or numbness and lack of sensation, continue the life-saving dosage of eight taels, adding four taels of qianghuo (Qianghuo) and six taels of forsythia (Lianqiao). This is the exterior symptom of an excess in the Six Classics, and treatment should start with the resolution of sweating. If there is obstruction in urination and defecation, consider using Sanhua Decoction or a local prescription of hemp seed pills for relief. However, since where the evil gathers, its energy must be deficient, there is often more internal injury than external invasion in the world, and this prescription should not be used lightly.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber - Treatment for Muscle Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The muscles of the entire body should not suffer from ailments; if they do, they will contract and cause pain. To relax the muscles, one must harmonize the blood, thus treating the muscles requires treating the blood. If a person experiences muscle tightness, hunchback, and inability to stand upright, they are suffering from a muscle disease. One should use one ounce of Dong Quai, five qian each of white peony, coix seed, raw rehmannia, and original reference, along with one qian of chaihu, boiled in water for consumption. The uniqueness of this formula lies in the use of chaihu among nourishing blood herbs. It is known that blood deficiency leads to muscle disease, and thus using blood-nourishing herbs should suffice; however, why also include chaihu to help dispel? It is essential to understand that the muscles are a surplus of the liver. When liver qi is not flowing smoothly, the muscles tighten abnormally, even leading to hunching. By using chaihu to relieve the stagnant liver qi, and combining it with substantial blood-nourishing agents, the muscles receive their nourishment and relaxation, and thus all symptoms will be resolved.</p>
<p>For treatment of muscle diseases, use three qian of Dong Quai, one ounce of peony root, two ounces of cooked rehmannia, five qian of rice poria, and one qian each of cinnamon, chaihu, and white mustard seed, boiled in water for consumption. This formula serves to treat both the kidney and liver. Although the muscles belong to the liver, nourishing the liver requires attention to the kidneys. Now, with a strong supplementation of the kidneys and the addition of herbs that soothe the liver, how could the muscles not be made comfortable and well-nourished?<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Liver deficiency causing spasms:</strong> Use red smartweed leaves, cut into three segments, add one cup of water and three cups of wine, and simmer until reduced to four cups. Strain and divide into two doses to be taken warm. </p>
<p><strong>For spasms in the feet, causing pain and contraction:</strong> Take two taels of pine resin, finely ground like rice grains, and one penny of frankincense. Fry them slowly in a silver or stone vessel until charred, leaving only a little potency. Remove from heat, grind finely, and take one to two pennies with hot papaya wine. This treats all muscle ailments. Alternatively, use one tael of pine resin alone. </p>
<p><strong>For spasms:</strong> Take used cotton and soak it in strong vinegar, then steam it. While hot, wrap it around the patient&#39;s foot, replacing it when it cools. Do not pause until healed. </p>
<p><strong>To treat unbearable spasms throughout the body:</strong> Prepare an extremely salty soup and soak the afflicted area in it. </p>
<p><strong>Muscle relaxation method:</strong> For conditions after injuries where muscles contract and do not extend, this method can also be used for other muscle shrinkages. Use a bamboo tube longer than a foot, drill holes at both ends, tie a rope, and hang it around the waist. When seated, raise the legs to roll them. Do not count the time; it will prove effective over time. There was a person who fell from a horse and broke his leg; his foot muscles contracted and he couldn&#39;t walk.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: In spring, acupuncture at autumn equinox can relieve muscle spasms and counteract adverse qi, which can cause coughing, and if the condition does not improve, it may lead to sudden fright and weeping. If the disease is in the vessels, acupuncture at the vessel will not injure the muscles; if the muscles are injured, it will affect the liver, and if the liver is affected, the spring illness will manifest as heat causing the muscles to relax. Acupuncture that targets the muscles will not injure the flesh, but when it reaches the flesh, it could affect the muscles. Acupuncture that targets the flesh without affecting the muscles will pass through and touch the muscles. This is known as reversal. </p>
<p>When the disease is in the muscles, causing spasms and joint pain, it may prevent movement, and this is called muscle paralysis. Acupuncture should be done on the muscles above, and the treatment should not reach the bones. If the disease arises from muscle distension, and if the condition has ceased, it should be noted. </p>
<p>The &quot;Ling Shu&quot; says: For joint acupuncture, the needle should be inserted directly on either side along the muscles to address muscle paralysis; caution should be taken to avoid bleeding, as this corresponds to the liver. Some refer to this as &quot;Yuan acupuncture,&quot; or &quot;Qi acupuncture.&quot; </p>
<p>For &quot;Hui acupuncture,&quot; the needle is inserted on the sides, lifting it forward and backward, to relieve muscle tension and treat muscle paralysis. If the arm is bent and cannot stretch, the issue lies in the muscles; if it stretches but cannot bend, the issue is in the bones. One should focus on preserving the bones with bone issues and the muscles with muscle issues. </p>
<p>When dealing with muscle cramps in the yang, treat the yang; when handling muscle cramps in the yin, treat the yin—all of this requires precise acupuncture. For violent cramps, convulsions, and dizziness, if the feet cannot support the body, one should target the Tian Zhu point.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those suffering from convulsive diseases exhibit weakness and tension; severe needling at the large spine and major vessels of the neck is necessary. They experience excessive vomiting of foamy fluid and downward gas release; if left untreated, it worsens. </p>
<p>In cases of fevers, with a pale face, headaches, and restless limbs, needling between the tendons with the fourth needle at the four extremes is advised. For muscle atrophy and drowning vision, one must seek the tendons linked to the liver; if that fails, then those related to metal, which corresponds to the lungs. </p>
<p>In fevers accompanied by frequent scares, leading to seizures and madness, the pulse should be taken, using the fourth needle to drain the excess. If convulsive diseases cause hair loss, blood should be sought from the heart; if that fails, look to water, which relates to the kidneys. </p>

Bo Gao said: Diseases change and manifest in various ways, sometimes floating, sometimes sinking, sometimes appearing shallow, and at other times deep; they cannot be fully exhausted in understanding, as each exists in its own place.

Upon examination, all six pulses were found to be tense, and a strong, wide pulse was present. The symptoms included hand spasms, constipation and dry stools, and a flushed, hot face, indicating the initial onset of wind-cold attacking the body. The limbs, corresponding to the spleen, were affected by the evil of wind-cold, resulting in spasms and rigidity as the wind troubled the minor ailments while the cold remained external. As stated in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; cold causes the muscles to contract, which precisely describes this condition. The individual had a history of alcohol consumption, leading to internal heat accumulating in the digestive tract, causing constipation and a hot face. Internally, the Yangming channels in the hands and feet were influenced by the evil, while externally, the Taiyin spleen channel suffered from wind-cold. I used cinnamon twig and licorice to dispel the cold evil and alleviate the spasms; bitter and cold huanglian was employed to drain the excess and moisten dryness, providing urgent assistance to kidney water. I used sibia and kudzu root to elevate Yang energy, promoting the flow in the Yangming channels of the arms and legs, preventing stagnation. Additionally, cinnamon twig, being acrid and warm, entered the hand Yangming to moisten dryness; I added peony and licorice, specifically to replenish spleen energy, protecting against wind-cold and expelling wood malignancy, consequently benefiting lung metal. I included ginseng to replenish the primary energy for support; adding the body of angelica, I resolved internal urgency and harmonized the blood to moisten dryness, naming the formula &quot;Active Blood Circulation Decoction.&quot; I further instructed the patient to stay in a warm room near the fire, rubbing her hands, leading to recovery.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman who was usually affected by phlegm and heat suddenly became faint, experiencing spasms and convulsions, with frequent startles. Her limbs were stiff, and phlegm rose up. This was due to severe dryness in the lung and insufficient blood. She was treated with Qingzao Decoction and Liuwei Pill, and soon recovered.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Yuyi Grass&quot; it is said: Xu Yue was robust, but years ago, after slightly injuring his finger and seeing blood, he washed it with cold water, which caused the blood to coagulate and not disperse. It swelled and produced several pints of pus and blood, and the tendons retracted, resulting in dysfunction of the finger. Recently, between his legs, he found himself feeling cold as autumn moon approached, heavily covering himself, feeling hot on the outside but cold within. Recently, he experienced pain in the tendons from heel to knee, making it inconvenient to travel far.</p>
<p>An old doctor advised him to take Bawei Pill, deeply understanding its significance. Upon examining him, I found his pulse difficult to sense, but the pulses of the liver and lungs were notably strong, indicating a serious condition. Especially in winter, when wood falls and metal is cold, this is particularly unsuitable. The current condition may worsen if not addressed, and one should be cautious with the ingredients of Bawei Pill, especially the cinnamon and aconite.</p>
<p>Why is this? The tendons are linked to the liver. The blood nourishing the tendons could hardly be available due to the previous finger injury, which cannot sustain them. Coupled with anger and frequent movements, liver heat transfers to the tendons, causing stiffness in the large tendons of the feet, leading to discomfort and difficulty in walking. However, the liver governs the lungs, and wood is fearful of metal; if the lungs do not clear, then the energy cannot circulate downward throughout the body.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the lung pulse is large, the lung qi is harmed by the heart&#39;s dominion, resulting in obstruction and unclear flow; hence the yang qi cannot descend, leading to cold in the extremities. Although the ailment seems minor, it has already violated the three reversals. Normally, the pulse is fine, but now it is large: one reversal. The liver pulse is large and heat descends, presenting the second reversal. The lung pulse is large and the qi is obstructed upwards, representing the third reversal. If one mistakenly uses cinnamon or aconite to treat it, the heat will become hotter and the obstruction will worsen, leading to atrophy or paralysis within a day. At this juncture, when using medication, it is crucial to be subtle and discerning, as common understanding may not grasp it. The sinews and vessels are short and rigid, the liver qi is internally trapped; thus, one must urgently discuss the method of using metal to conquer wood. By using metal to conquer wood, wood will counter-vigorously thrive, and the sinews will relax. If one does not deeply understand the primordial creation, who can know this? If the metal qi is not obstructed, wood would hasten to fulfill its command without hesitation; how could it dare to resist inwardly? Only if the metal loses its rigidity and turns soft can the wood lose its softness and become rigid. Therefore, when treating this ailment, the foremost principle is to clear the metal. However, clearing the metal first requires clarifying the stomach. If the stomach is not clear, one drinks alcohol, causing heat to be transmitted to the lungs; or consumes rich flavors, resulting in turbid qi being transmitted to the lungs. What medicinal power could possibly fulfill the duty of clearing metal? If the metal is not cleared, it is like having a formidable enemy in front; the general is feeble and cannot expect success. How could one abandon the clearing of metal and instead further assist fire to melt metal, thereby acting in direct opposition to treatment? Such an outcome is bound to be futile.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a></p></div>

Yang energy nourishes the tendons when it is gentle; when yang is damaged and cannot nourish the tendons, the large tendons become short and constricted, while the small tendons become loose and elongated. The large tendons connect within the joints, thus they shorten due to accumulated heat. The small tendons are connected outside the bones and flesh, thus they become loose due to dampness. Shortness leads to sudden contraction and spasms, while length leads to excessive relaxation and atrophy.* The essence of yang energy is such that great anger causes the vital essence to become depleted and the blood to stagnate upwards, leading to feelings of faintness and injury to the tendons, which may cause them to not be able to bear weight."},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"When great anger arises, the yang energy reverses upward, disrupting the movement of energy within the body.

When the muscles are injured and slackened, the limbs feel as if they cannot be freely used. Excessively spicy flavors weaken the muscles and tendons, leading to a lack of spirit. Therefore, it is important to harmonize the five flavors, ensuring bones are aligned and muscles are supple, allowing qi and blood to flow and the pores to be tight. In this way, the essence of bone qi becomes refined, adherence to the proper method ensures longevity and aligns with the mandate of heaven. When the metal energy is overly strong, it injures the liver energy, resulting in slackened muscles and tendons. The kidneys store essence and govern the bones, while the liver stores blood and regulates the tendons. Wind invading with excessive energy injures the liver, leading to the loss of essence. Thus, harmonizing the five flavors ensures bones are aligned, muscles are pliable, and pores are tightly closed. Therefore, those skilled in healing first treat the skin and hair, then the muscles and flesh, next the tendons and vessels, after that the six hollow organs, and finally the five viscera. Treating the five viscera involves a state of half-life and half-death. When pathogens invade the interior and do not resolve through the hollow organs, they affect the viscera. If the pathogens are within the qi channels of the five viscera, there is still a chance for recovery and life; but if they affect the viscera, it leads to death.

Excessive consumption of pungent food leads to taut tendons and withered nails. **Note:** Pungent refers to a metal flavor, and overindulgence harms the liver, leading to contracted tendons and withered nails. All tendons belong to the joints. **Note:** Tendons arise from the bones, connected between the joints. ### Discussion on the Fundamental Essence of Pulses The Emperor asked: \"What is the cause of abscesses, muscle cramps, and bone pain?\" Qibo replied: \"These are swellings caused by cold qi and changes due to the eight winds.\" **Note:** This refers to the evils of wind and cold during the four seasons, transforming into heat diseases such as abscesses and cramps. ### Discussion on Human Vitality The true essence of the organs disperses within the liver; the liver stores the qi of the tendons."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"**Translation:** The true essence of the organ is the spirit it houses.

The kidneys communicate with the heart, leading to ailments that affect the tendons and vessels, known as \"spasm.\" At this time, both moxibustion and medicine can be used. If left untreated for ten days, death is inevitable. The heart governs the blood vessels and is associated with fire; when the fire is overly intense, the tendons and vessels become dry and constricted, leading to stiffness in the hands and feet. In cases of acute danger, moxibustion and medicine can still be employed, meaning one should not abandon treatment due to severity. If untreated for ten days, death is likely. When food energy enters the stomach, it spreads essence to the liver and moist energy to the tendons. Sour flavors affect the tendons, and one suffering from tendon disease should avoid consuming too much sour food. The liver is related to the tendons; prolonged activity can harm the tendons. Basic suffering results in joy, with conditions arising in the tendons, which should be treated with pressing and guiding methods. When physical labor exhausts the body, it injures the tendons; if one's aspirations are relaxed but the blood vessels are not ill, then treatment through pressing and guiding is employed to nourish the tendons and achieve stability."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"**Treatise on Qi Obstruction** The spleen transfers cold to the liver, causing abscesses and muscle spasms.

In spring, those who encounter this suffer from muscle obstruction, and if it persists, they may be further affected by evils that reside within the liver. The Emperor said: In cases of Bi, some die, while others experience prolonged pain, and some recover easily. What is the reason for this? Qi Bo answered: Those who suffer deep internal injury die; those who linger between the muscles and bones experience prolonged pain; those who remain in the skin recover easily. [Note: The evils become lodged in the organs when the organ qi is sufficiently strong, preventing them from moving. If the spirit qi dissipates, then the evil converges in the organs and causes death. Those who linger between muscles and bones without settling deeper experience prolonged pain; those remaining in the skin disperse easily with the qi.] The Emperor asked: Why is it that Bi syndrome does not cause pain? Qi Bo replied: When it is in the bones, it feels heavy; in the vessels, blood congeals and does not flow; in the muscles, it cannot bend or stretch; in the flesh, it loses sensitivity; in the skin, it causes coldness. Therefore, when these five conditions are present, there is no pain. [Note: If the disease manifests in form without harming the qi, one may observe the heaviness of bone obstruction, the stagnation of blood in the vessels, the inability to bend and stretch in the muscles, the insensitivity in the flesh, and the cold in the skin, thereby presenting these five clinical signs without pain.]"},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"**Discussion on Weakness** When liver qi is hot, bile leaks, leading to a bitter taste in the mouth and the drying of the fascia.

The gallbladder is attached to the liver; when liver qi is hot, bile leaks, causing bitterness in the mouth. When bile leaks, the fascia cannot be nourished and dries up; when the fascia is dry, it becomes tight and cramp results in muscle weakness.] Endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires lead to indulgence in external fantasies, overindulging in sexual activity causes the foundational muscles to loosen, resulting in muscle weakness and even seminal emission. Thus, muscle weakness originates from the liver, manifesting internally. [Note: Endless thoughts and unfulfilled desires damage liver qi.

The ribs and elbows are the joints of muscles and bones, hence they cannot stretch; evils are closed off outside, resulting in internal bone stiffness; the internal nourishing and protective energies are inverted, leading to external numbness, termed \"insufficiency.\" The excess of hot evils is categorized as surplus, while the cold nature is dense and stagnant, thus leading to insufficiency.

If the Tai Chong (a pulse) is blocked, it results in death without treatment. (Note: The restoration of Yangming begins at its proper time, hence the significant rise of pure qi. If pure qi enters the liver, it affects the organ, which is in a state of half-life and half-death; if the evil is feeble, but the organ is truly unharmed, one survives.

Sores and swellings, along with various other symptoms, also arise from the influences of damp heat, as they move from above downwards and from the outside inwards. In the case of the jué yīn at the spring, when the external energy is excessive, the major joints become restricted; internally, there are convulsions and stiffness, while externally there is discomfort. When the external energy is in control, it results in tightness and pain in the muscles and bones. The major joints refer to the twelve joints of hands and feet. The jué yīn at the spring, influenced by external energies, is first affected by the dry metal of the yang ming, while the jué yīn governs the tendons, and dryness affects joint mobility.

Observing this, it is evident that muscle spasms and twitching arise from excessive sweating leading to a loss of Yang energy, which is visibly deficient. Even though this is a reversal, it should be understood that it stems from sweating leading to a loss of Yang energy and exterior deficiency. Treatment should focus on warming the channels and boosting Yang energy. If there are also symptoms from vomiting, purging, and sweating, resulting in both interior and exterior deficiency, the situation is different from that caused solely by sweating. The classic text states: after vomiting and purging in cold damage, if there is excessive deficiency with restlessness, a markedly weak pulse, and symptoms persisting for eight or nine days—such as a feeling of fullness below the heart, pain below the ribs, and Qi surging up to the throat, leading to dizziness and muscle pulsations—this can result in prolonged weakness. This scenario is a severe form of reversal. The classic text notes: if the movement of Qi is on the left, one must not induce sweating; doing so will cause dizziness, persistent sweating, and muscle spasms. This indicates that excess sweating affects the liver Qi."},{"anchor":"trans-41p","marker":"41p","type":"translation","text":"**On External Pathogenic Factors** By Li Gao of the Yuan Dynasty The evil qi of heaven, when it affects a person, harms the five organs. It is the evil of the eight winds, and this wind evil injures the muscles and bones. When the wind impacts from above, it injures the muscles, while the cold harms the bones. This is because tangible substances fall ill, connected to the lower jiao, specifically the liver and kidneys. The liver and kidneys represent the qi of the earth. The \"Nan Jing\" explains that when the qi of the liver and kidneys is depleted within, it is because the liver governs the muscles and the kidneys govern the bones; therefore, when the wind evil affects a person, it causes pain in the muscles and bones. If the muscles and bones are exhausted, then the foundation of the kidneys and liver is also depleted. This represents an excess condition."},{"anchor":"trans-42p","marker":"42p","type":"translation","text":"**Distinguishing Internal and External Injuries** Internal injuries and illnesses arise when the vital energy of the heart and lungs is depleted from the exterior, leading to lethargy and a desire to lie down, with the limbs feeling heavy and unable to move. This is due to heat damaging the original vital energy. The spleen governs the limbs, and when affected by heat, it lacks the energy to move. The classics say heat injures qi and also that heat causes bones to dissolve and muscles to slacken; this is what is meant. In contrast, external injuries from wind and cold occur when the vital energies of the kidneys and liver are depleted internally. The kidneys govern the bones and are affected by cold, while the liver governs the muscles and is affected by wind. Since ancient times, conditions of the kidneys and liver have been treated similarly, as they mutually support each other. Thus, the classics state that the gallbladder governs the muscles, and the bladder governs the bones. Whether from a stroke or from catching a cold, once the illness strikes, one may fall into bed, unable to rise; it is not merely a lack of strength, but pain in the muscles and bones resulting in immobility, indicating injury to the physical form. The classics say cold damages the physical condition, and also that cold causes muscle cramps and bone pain; this is what is meant. **Atrophy and Stretching** Heat in the liver leads to muscle atrophy, causing the muscles to become slackened. All forms of atrophy belong to the upper regions, indicating that the root of the illness lies in the lungs. Therefore, it must first arise in the lungs, after which the heat spreads to the five organs, resulting in various forms of atrophy. **Heart Method of Danxi** [Source: Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng]"},{"anchor":"trans-43p","marker":"43p","type":"translation","text":"**Muscle Disease Should Be Treated According to the Classics** Muscle cramps and spasms lead to the contraction of the yin, with both legs cramping; these symptoms belong to the Foot Jueyin Liver Meridian.

If there is cold, abdominal fullness and pain, limbs stiff and tense, and spasms causing diarrhea, one should take the Lizhong Decoction with added fresh Aconite and Cinnamon. **Muscle Dryness** The text states: “All that is withered and drained dry, with firm tendons and cracked dry skin, pertains to dryness.” \"Yuan Disease Form\" states: \"The classics say wind, heat, and fire are all yang; cold, dryness, and dampness are all yin.” Dryness and dampness are somewhat different. However, drying metal corresponds to autumn yin, which differs from cold dampness; thus, it reacts similarly to wind heat. When fire is hot, metal weakens and wind arises, because wind can overcome dampness, and heat can deplete fluids and lead to cold. When yang is strong and yin is weak, then wind heat triumphs over water dampness and causes dryness. In general, wind diseases in people arise mostly due to excess heat, wherein wind-dryness coexists, with heat being the dominant factor. The liver governs the tendons; when wind is excessive and combined with dryness and heat, the tendons become exceedingly dry. Dry metal is responsible for contraction, resulting in tense and urgent pulses, leading to muscle stiffness and mouth closure."},{"anchor":"trans-44p","marker":"44p","type":"translation","text":"Some may suffer from excessive dryness and heat, leading to the dehydration of the spleen and stomach, resulting in thirst; others may experience severe wind-heat, which remains at the surface while the internal energy is balanced; some may find it hard to stretch and feel tightness in their sinews; at times, they may feel cold with twitching muscles. In addition, the combination of wind, heat, and dryness may cause significant stagnation internally, leading to restlessness and possibly constipation. In cases of wind invasion, it can emerge from excessive heat and dryness, transforming into phlegm, causing dryness in the chest and diaphragm, leading to symptoms of dizziness, faintness, and collapse. All these manifestations arise from the excess of heat that creates dryness. The variations in illnesses are due to the differing degrees of wind, heat, and dryness. The phenomenon of muscle relaxation in cases of wind is caused by the predominance of wind-heat over dampness, leading to pronounced dryness. Under such circumstances, relaxation of the muscles results in weakness and numbness, hence various symptoms of stagnation and weakness are related to the lung metal, indicating the transformation of dryness. When autumn deepens and dryness intensifies, grasses and trees wither and do not thrive, reflecting the signs of illness. Thus, when blood is sufficient, one can grasp and maintain strength; when blood is ample in the legs, one can walk.

If the disease is in the vessels, acupuncture at the vessel will not injure the muscles; if the muscles are injured, it will affect the liver, and if the liver is affected, the spring illness will manifest as heat causing the muscles to relax. Acupuncture that targets the muscles will not injure the flesh, but when it reaches the flesh, it could affect the muscles. Acupuncture that targets the flesh without affecting the muscles will pass through and touch the muscles. This is known as reversal. When the disease is in the muscles, causing spasms and joint pain, it may prevent movement, and this is called muscle paralysis. Acupuncture should be done on the muscles above, and the treatment should not reach the bones. If the disease arises from muscle distension, and if the condition has ceased, it should be noted. The \"Ling Shu\" says: For joint acupuncture, the needle should be inserted directly on either side along the muscles to address muscle paralysis; caution should be taken to avoid bleeding, as this corresponds to the liver. Some refer to this as \"Yuan acupuncture,\" or \"Qi acupuncture.\" For \"Hui acupuncture,\" the needle is inserted on the sides, lifting it forward and backward, to relieve muscle tension and treat muscle paralysis. If the arm is bent and cannot stretch, the issue lies in the muscles; if it stretches but cannot bend, the issue is in the bones.

Upon examination, all six pulses were found to be tense, and a strong, wide pulse was present. The symptoms included hand spasms, constipation and dry stools, and a flushed, hot face, indicating the initial onset of wind-cold attacking the body. The limbs, corresponding to the spleen, were affected by the evil of wind-cold, resulting in spasms and rigidity as the wind troubled the minor ailments while the cold remained external. As stated in the \"Inner Canon,\" cold causes the muscles to contract, which precisely describes this condition. The individual had a history of alcohol consumption, leading to internal heat accumulating in the digestive tract, causing constipation and a hot face. Internally, the Yangming channels in the hands and feet were influenced by the evil, while externally, the Taiyin spleen channel suffered from wind-cold. I used cinnamon twig and licorice to dispel the cold evil and alleviate the spasms; bitter and cold huanglian was employed to drain the excess and moisten dryness, providing urgent assistance to kidney water. I used sibia and kudzu root to elevate Yang energy, promoting the flow in the Yangming channels of the arms and legs, preventing stagnation. Additionally, cinnamon twig, being acrid and warm, entered the hand Yangming to moisten dryness; I added peony and licorice, specifically to replenish spleen energy, protecting against wind-cold and expelling wood malignancy, consequently benefiting lung metal. I included ginseng to replenish the primary energy for support; adding the body of angelica, I resolved internal urgency and harmonized the blood to moisten dryness, naming the formula \"Active Blood Circulation Decoction.\" I further instructed the patient to stay in a warm room near the fire, rubbing her hands, leading to recovery. The \"Medical Case of Xue Ji\" states: A postpartum woman suffered from muscle spasms and soft arms, with her muscles twitching, all attributed to Qi and blood deficiency. She was treated with the \"Shiquan Dabu Decoction\" and recovered."},{"anchor":"trans-87p","marker":"87p","type":"translation","text":"A woman who was usually affected by phlegm and heat suddenly became faint, experiencing spasms and convulsions, with frequent startles. Her limbs were stiff, and phlegm rose up. This was due to severe dryness in the lung and insufficient blood. She was treated with Qingzao Decoction and Liuwei Pill, and soon recovered. In the \"Yuyi Grass\" it is said: Xu Yue was robust, but years ago, after slightly injuring his finger and seeing blood, he washed it with cold water, which caused the blood to coagulate and not disperse. It swelled and produced several pints of pus and blood, and the tendons retracted, resulting in dysfunction of the finger. Recently, between his legs, he found himself feeling cold as autumn moon approached, heavily covering himself, feeling hot on the outside but cold within. Recently, he experienced pain in the tendons from heel to knee, making it inconvenient to travel far. An old doctor advised him to take Bawei Pill, deeply understanding its significance. Upon examining him, I found his pulse difficult to sense, but the pulses of the liver and lungs were notably strong, indicating a serious condition. Especially in winter, when wood falls and metal is cold, this is particularly unsuitable. The current condition may worsen if not addressed, and one should be cautious with the ingredients of Bawei Pill, especially the cinnamon and aconite. Why is this? The tendons are linked to the liver. The blood nourishing the tendons could hardly be available due to the previous finger injury, which cannot sustain them. Coupled with anger and frequent movements, liver heat transfers to the tendons, causing stiffness in the large tendons of the feet, leading to discomfort and difficulty in walking. However, the liver governs the lungs, and wood is fearful of metal; if the lungs do not clear, then the energy cannot circulate downward throughout the body."},{"anchor":"trans-88p","marker":"88p","type":"translation","text":"When the lung pulse is large, the lung qi is harmed by the heart's dominion, resulting in obstruction and unclear flow; hence the yang qi cannot descend, leading to cold in the extremities. Although the ailment seems minor, it has already violated the three reversals. Normally, the pulse is fine, but now it is large: one reversal. The liver pulse is large and heat descends, presenting the second reversal. The lung pulse is large and the qi is obstructed upwards, representing the third reversal. If one mistakenly uses cinnamon or aconite to treat it, the heat will become hotter and the obstruction will worsen, leading to atrophy or paralysis within a day. At this juncture, when using medication, it is crucial to be subtle and discerning, as common understanding may not grasp it. The sinews and vessels are short and rigid, the liver qi is internally trapped; thus, one must urgently discuss the method of using metal to conquer wood. By using metal to conquer wood, wood will counter-vigorously thrive, and the sinews will relax. If one does not deeply understand the primordial creation, who can know this? If the metal qi is not obstructed, wood would hasten to fulfill its command without hesitation; how could it dare to resist inwardly? Only if the metal loses its rigidity and turns soft can the wood lose its softness and become rigid. Therefore, when treating this ailment, the foremost principle is to clear the metal. However, clearing the metal first requires clarifying the stomach. If the stomach is not clear, one drinks alcohol, causing heat to be transmitted to the lungs; or consumes rich flavors, resulting in turbid qi being transmitted to the lungs. What medicinal power could possibly fulfill the duty of clearing metal? If the metal is not cleared, it is like having a formidable enemy in front; the general is feeble and cannot expect success. How could one abandon the clearing of metal and instead further assist fire to melt metal, thereby acting in direct opposition to treatment?
