<p><strong>Pediatric Sores and Ulcers Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>Direct Method for Treating Children</strong> <em>(Song Dynasty, Qian Yi)</em></p>
<p><strong>Dan Liu (Red Bumps)</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of Dan Liu are caused by heat toxins invading the pores, clashing with qi and blood, and manifesting on the skin. One should apply Baiyu San (White Jade Powder). </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The aforementioned symptoms may be due to congenital toxins, clashes of wind and heat, frequent baths in hot water, frequent contact with warm clothing, food injuries leading to fever, or a wet and rich diet from the wet nurse. Emotional stress can also generate heat. The red, moving lesions are blood driven by wind and heat. If it is due to congenital toxins, use Hua Du Dan (Detoxification Pill); for wind-heat, use Bai Du San (Dispelling Toxins Powder); for frequent baths and warm clothing, use Si Wu Decoction, Lian Qiao (Forsythia), and Shan Zhi Zi (Gardenia); for food-related fevers, use Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction), Chai Hu (Bupleurum), and Shen Qu (Malt); if the wet nurse eats rich foods, add Qing Wei San (Clearing the Stomach Powder); if the wet nurse has stagnant heat, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San (Modified Happy Wanderer Powder). All should include Lou Lu (Reed) for both mother and child to take. Baiyu San has a very cold nature and can relieve heat toxins; it is suitable for lighter toxicity appearing on the limbs. If the condition extends to the chest, back, and abdomen, it is serious and requires Huo Ming Yin (Reviving Life Drink); one must encourage the patient to exert effort to expel toxic blood concentrated in one area. If the abdomen is distended and there is difficulty with urination and defecation, toxins have entered internally, and Da Lian Qiao Yin (Major Forsythia Drink) may also produce recovery.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Complete Book of Sores and Ulcers</strong> <em>(Jin Dynasty, Dou Hanqing)</em></p>
<p><strong>Chi You Dan (Red Bumps)</strong><a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>When a child suffers from this red rash, it is due to toxins accumulated from the mother’s womb, hence it manifests on the skin and varies in location. If it arises from the abdomen and spreads to the limbs, it is mild; if it starts from the limbs and collects in the abdomen, it is severe. Urgent treatment can save the child. The child’s red rash is indeed caused by accumulated heat, known as fetal toxins. </p>
<p>This may occur when the mother during pregnancy indulges in spicy and toxic foods, bathes in hot water, or uses charcoal in winter, causing heat to enter the womb due to excessive desires. Sometimes, the child is born into a heated environment, either from warm bedding or heated clothing, leading to an offensive heat and toxin attacking from within and without. Around six months of age, all children show symptoms. </p>
<p>At first, there is a fever; upon inspection, the skin appears red, and the child cries incessantly, the rash seeming to shift locations. Rashes on the limbs are survivable, while those on the waist and abdomen predict danger. Urgently use a special magnet or needle to draw out the toxic blood from below upwards, allowing the poisoned blood to flow out. Do not apply the needle in reverse; instead, use powdered frankincense, mixing it with egg white for a uniform paste to apply where needed, and occasionally use juice from banana roots for application. </p>
<p>Internally, take a detoxifying pill made with vermilion, mixing it with honey, and subsequently take a drink made from water-ground gold bars. </p>
<p>If the rash appears on the head, how should one treat it? The child must sleep on a bed with one end raised using bricks, allowing the toxic vapors to flow out from the head. Use magnetic needles to expel both the toxic gases and blood from the crown. If a wet nurse holds the child while applying needles, the toxins will descend, possibly obstructing the throat, making survival difficult. </p>
<p>Careful observation of fellow practitioners shows many fail in their techniques and cause harm to children. Hence, I do not shy away from reiterating these details and additionally provide ten formulas for detoxification.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Ten Types of Dan Poison in Children</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Feizao Dan</strong>: It begins with swelling from the crown of the head, gradually becoming red and swollen, with swelling in the neck and red eyes. Take a bundle of fresh green onions, crush it to extract the juice, and apply it to the affected area. Another remedy involves mixing five taels of (shibu) saltpeter and two taels of realgar powder, then combining it with banana juice. Use a broken brush to apply the mixture, ensuring the patient lies down so that the juice seeps from below to the crown, allowing the poison to exit through the Baihui point. If applied incorrectly from below, the toxic vapors could invade the throat, making it difficult to treat.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Jizhao Dan</strong>: It presents as swelling and pain on the forehead. Apply a paste made of red adzuki bean powder mixed with egg white. This previous remedy is also effective.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Three Ghost Fire Pills: When red swelling arises on the face, use powdered dragon liver and chicken egg whites to apply. Then use banana root juice to moisten it, and apply powdered motherwort mixed with vinegar, which is also effective.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Four Heavenly Fire Pills: When red spots appear on the back, apply powdered mulberry bark mixed with sheep fat.</p>
<p>Five Heavenly Stove Pills: When swelling starts on the back, sometimes also from the hands, and appears red and yellow, use powdered ash from willow branches mixed with honey for application.</p>
<p>Six Water Pills: For swollen areas on both sides, use powdered fresh iron filings, or needle sand, or rusty nails, mixed with pig fat for application.</p>
<p>Seven Gourd Pills: When yellow swelling arises around the navel, apply powdered betel nut mixed with rice vinegar.</p>
<p>Eight Wild Fire Pills: When red swelling arises from both legs, apply powdered frankincense mixed with sheep fat.</p>
<p>Nine Smoke Fire Pills: Also when red and white spots arise from both legs, use dirt from under a pigsty mixed with sesame oil for application.</p>
<p>Ten Leak Pills: When yellow swelling arises in the genital region, use dirt from a leaky roof mixed with sheep fat.</p>
<p>External Medicine Essentials 【Song Dynasty, Chen Ziming】</p>
<p>Abscesses</p>
<p>All children belong to pure Yang, and their abscesses are often caused by heat in the heart.  【Note: It is foolish to assume this is solely due to constitution. There are cases, like when treating the red swelling of Sun from Nanku with my method of detoxifying from maternal toxins, resulting in recovery. Later, he experienced fever and cough, with differing symptoms that were hard to define. Upon diagnosis of his mother showing signs of stagnant heat and blood heat, I used detoxifying and liver-clearing medicines, and both mother and child were cured.】<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>The Matters of Filial Piety in Confucianism</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Second Degree Fire</strong></p>
<p>In the case of children suffering from ailments such as sores, hives, and pox, especially during a time when fire energies are predominant or when the wandering star brings chaos, one should not hastily use Shengma Decoction to resolve them. Shengma Decoction possesses a spicy and warm flavor. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that heat is produced by accumulated warmth, which is termed heavy fire; it should only be treated with cooling herbs that are spicy in nature. If encountered at normal times, spicy warmth may be applied, as there is usually no urgent issue.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to carefully examine the state of the illness; in severe cases, spicy warmth is also unsuitable. After a dispersal, one should use Liangge Powder combined with Angelica and Baihu Decoction, or Huadan Decoction, or Yulu Powder for decoction. For even more severe cases, detoxifying decoctions and regulating stomach powders should be applied. The ancients said: &quot;Rashes and sores, both at the beginning and end, should not be purged,&quot; which is erroneous. Do we not know that pouring water to stop boiling is inferior to removing the firewood from beneath the pot? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: “In the years of the fifth yin and the fifth shen, this illness occurs frequently, primarily due to the yang fire of Shaoyang.” Furthermore, it is noted that when Shaoyang&#39;s external energy prevails, hives and rashes manifest on the exterior. Additionally, all pain-related ailments and sores are attributed to heart fire. Wang Taifu further stated that all maladies stem from the heart. How can one rashly apply spicy warmth to disperse? If the heat intensifies, it may lead to internal toxins and blood loss, resulting in severe symptoms such as grinding teeth and convulsions; this indicates significant heat.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Like the white tiger combined with ginseng, and the Cooling the Diaphragm Powder added with Angelica and Platycodon, do not ask about autumn and winter; just see the sores and rashes, it works effectively. For children with sores, hives, grain rashes, red swellings, and blotch toxins, if there is internal poison leading to bleeding. The Inner Canon states: if the minor yang&#39;s guest qi prevails, then the red swellings and rashes appear externally. This is because residual heat has not been resolved, thus leading to internal poison and bleeding. Treat it with Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, White Tiger Decoction, and Cooling the Diaphragm Powder, selecting according to the clinical presentation. The so-called white tiger is traditionally said not to be used in autumn and winter, but that is a mistake. It can be used whenever there is this symptom, for it belongs to the fire of the corresponding organs.</p>
<p>For children with red swollen tumors with toxic heat spreading throughout the body, it indicates the poison of pathogenic heat. You can use magnet pieces to draw out the purple blood, and the illness will immediately improve. If it does not heal, later use Cooling the Diaphragm Powder combined with Rhubarb and Glauber&#39;s Salt for a good effect; next, use the Poison Cleansing Powder to wash out three to five times for guaranteed recovery. The classic says: red swellings and tumors of the fire color are governed by the fire of the corresponding organs.</p>
<p>For children with sudden red swellings, you can first use Niuhuang Tongge Wan to purge it, then apply Yangqishi San for the swelling and poison to dissipate by itself; if it does not, you can use a (Jinfei) needle to puncture, letting blood flow out to ensure recovery.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Ulcers and Skin Conditions</strong></p>
<p>For children with ulcers, scabies, or skin lesions, you can use a mixture of realgar powder with a little bit of mirabilite, mixed with oil for application. If there are sores or lesions on the face, it’s not advisable to apply medicine, for fear of it getting into the eyes, which could result in damage to vision.</p>
<p><strong>Boils and Tumors</strong></p>
<p>When children experience red tumors and swellings that cause continuous pain, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all pains and itchy sores are due to heart fire, and a specific incantation can be used to suppress it. The method involves a mental focus, and the incantation goes as follows: &quot;Dragon spirits flow, all toxic swellings; sores with pus and blood are causing pain; forget the mind, recite the Great Compassion Mantra, and the toxins will dissipate.&quot; </p>
<p>Repeat the incantation three times, while facing the sun, moon, or a light source, take a breath, and blow it onto the swollen tumors. With the right hand, make a gentle gathering and compressing motion over the sores three times, while keeping the left hand still. Each breath should be followed by three gentle gathers and compresses, with no taboos to worry about. When using this method, ensure your mind is focused. This method comes from my ancestor, Han, and has been passed down for over a hundred years, successfully helping countless people. If the patient does not consume meat or alcohol, the method becomes even more effective. Those suffering from sores and swellings should avoid warm and moving foods like chicken, pork, fish, and rabbit. This method should not be treated lightly; it can be applied where no medicines are available.</p>
<p><strong>Pingzhi Huicui</strong>  【Yuan, Zhu Zhenheng】<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Red Sores</strong></p>
<p>Red sores should be treated with fresh rehmannia, mutong, and the bitter herbs such as dogbane, along with balsam oil applied to the affected area. Children often suffer from stasis of the heart qi leading to sores and abscesses, which result from excessive intake while in the womb. This is a principle that must be addressed. Children, before they are able to see or think, have no means to feel such stasis in their hearts. Ancient sages stated that infants often have much dampness and heat due to prenatal excess; also, when the fetus is being formed, the parents’ qi and blood may be imbalanced in cold and heat, leading to numerous illnesses in their offspring. In particular, as their bodies are not yet sturdy and their membranes are delicate, any slight disturbance should be addressed rigorously. </p>
<p>I once saw a person who had suffered from long-term cough illness. After recovery, he had a son who, at three months old, developed a fever and a boil appeared under the right armpit between the yangming and shaoyang areas. As this abscess healed, another one formed under the left armpit, oozing pus and blood with no signs of recovery. The physician Wang Shoufu treated him with Siwu Decoction and Baidu San, adding ginseng, using xiangfu to assist and rhinoceros horn as the main ingredient, feeding the mother for two months, after which the child was stable. </p>
<p>After three months, he suddenly developed abdominal swelling and a red rash resembling clouds. Juices from cut grass were mixed with silkworm droppings and applied to it, leading to gradual disappearance. Half a month later, the swelling moved into the capsule, becoming a lump that looked concerning. After two days, the capsule burst, revealing two masses that discharged clear fluid. Using perilla leaves to hold fine charcoal powder, it took about ten days for the condition to heal. It must be understood that the prolonged illness of the father likely caused the mother to have worries and anger, exacerbating the remaining heat and toxins from the cough, leading to this situation. </p>
<p>— From &quot;Treasures of Health&quot; 【Yuan Dynasty, Luo Tianyi】<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Eyebrow Refinement</strong></p>
<p>The refinement of the eyebrow in children is called eyebrow refinement on the face, it is referred to as zjier in the ears, and as shoe itch in the feet. These three names are all erroneous. The <em>Inner Canon</em> states that all pain, itch, sores, and ulcers are attributed to the heart fire; it is the result of excessive heat from the heart fire. One can use a (non-metal) needle to prick it and cause bleeding; if it does not heal with one prick, it must be pricked again, as a second prick will surely lead to healing. The <em>Inner Canon</em> states that when there is excess blood, it should be drained. To drain means to break the blood. For eyebrow refinement, one must not apply medication externally. If the sores are very itchy, it will lead to scratching; if the medicine enters the eye, it will surely cause damage.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Poison</strong></p>
<p>Children with red dan poison, although there are ten types, are all caused by the internal exuberance of heart fire, where heat collides with blood. It may arise from the hands and feet or manifest on the head, face, chest, and back, wandering up and down. Its heat is like fire, with pain that is indescribable, and red like cinnabar, hence it is named dan poison. If it emerges from the abdomen to the limbs, it is easy to treat; if it goes from the limbs into the abdomen, it is difficult to treat. The method to treat this condition must first use exterior medications to resolve heat poison before applying topical treatments. If medications are applied hastily, causing the qi to be trapped without release, they might harm the internal organs. Dan poison in children is easy to treat for those over one year old, but difficult for those under one year old. The ten types of dan tumors in children are: 1. Flying stove dan, 2. Walking stove dan, 3. Ghost fire dan, 4. Heavenly fire dan, 5. Heavenly escape dan, 6. Water dan, 7. Gourd dan, 8. Wild fire dan, 9. Smoke fire dan, 10. Hu lou dan.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>Scholar Xu said: This ten types of dandu (toxic rash) cannot be treated if not addressed within three days; if it attacks the intestines and stomach, it is beyond saving. One should carefully distinguish each type and follow the prescribed methods to avoid any mistakes.</p>
<p>For children with the ten types of dandu, first administer a decoction of Fangfeng and Shengma to resolve the toxicity, followed by the use of the Qizhen method to eliminate the toxic blood. If Qizhen is not available, use the Bian needle method. Then employ emergency measures.</p>
<p>For children with dandu, symptoms such as abdominal bloating, wheezing, unrest and refusal to nurse, or convulsions, indicate that treatment is not advisable.</p>
<p>If a child is within a hundred days after birth and more than half a year old, with slightly swollen reddish eyelids and a dusky complexion, becoming restless at night or having a face resembling rouge, this is due to internal heat manifesting externally. Initially, the face may appear similar to chickenpox, with slightly reddened feet and irregular appearance. If the neck becomes as red as cinnabar, it is called &quot;jingdan&quot; (startling dan). Treat with Sanjie San.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Children suffering from red rashes and dan disease may originate from ten causes. It is all due to excessive heat in the heart, fluctuating up and down. Its color is murky like cinnabar, hence the name “dan disease.” The treatment methods are clearly laid out in medical texts, depending on the practitioner&#39;s understanding.</p>
<p>In children, dan is the most toxic, manifesting differently in ten forms. From above to below, it may not reach the chest; from below to the kidneys, it can cause great distress. Within half a cycle, it should not be seen; a full cycle indicates the need for intervention. The use of qīzhēn (a kind of needle) is effective both internally and externally.</p>
<p>For internal relief, one uses red peony, qinghao, and protective wind herbs. Sheng ma, licorice, and rehmannia are combined, while bamboo leaves and original ginseng are boiled for use. Externally, Yiyuan is pasted on, and cold water is similarly employed. Within three to five days, urgent measures should be taken, for surprises may arise akin to dreams.</p>
<p>The treatment of dan follows a certain order, starting from the head and laying out each step. Dissolving the exterior and using detoxifying agents comes first, followed by inserting qīzhēn. If qīzhēn is inconvenient, one should urgently use acupuncture needles. Then apply medicinal ointments to save the child, a method established by predecessors.</p>
<p>The swift method requires detoxification first, or employing purgative medicines to relieve blockage. At the onset, do not aggressively attack; poisons lurking within must be expelled. The treasure of detoxification is unparalleled, along with decoctions of protective wind and sheng ma. Effective medicinal substances possess divine power, depending entirely on the skill of the healer.</p>
<p>Experienced methods for treating dan are now shared for future generations. First, cleanse and purify the sick body, then apply soothing treatments. Bashed field snails can be prepared for application, or water can be mixed with heating methods. Moreover, use nansheng and rhubarb in moderation, with mang xiao ground and soaked in water.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Heating the clothes for the child, the fire elixir is thus formed. Bitter salt and cold water stone, blue indigo and gypsum are marvelous. Why does the red mole arise? It is due to excessive heat in the womb. In truth, it is not a great harm, there is no need to seek a doctor for treatment.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>Fetal toxicity refers to the fiery poison within the essence and blood, specifically the poison of the Fire of the Vital Gate. The Vital Gate is where men store their essence and women maintain their womb. Observing the discussions by Dongyuan on red tumors and Danxi on fetal toxicity, the treatment methods can be discerned. Ancient formulas exist for detoxification, such as the Huanglian Gancao method, and there are also elixirs for nurturing infants and detoxification, which are both good methods. </p>
<p>I have recently established a new formula using Danxi&#39;s Sanbu Pill recipe, with Qinxian, Huanglian, and Hainang half-cooked and stir-fried in half wine, and Gancao half-cooked and half-roasted, each blended into powder in equal portions. Forming them into pills the size of sesame seeds with a coating of vermilion and realgar, I named it the Shengshu Jiedu Pill. Administering this to children daily is beneficial.</p>
<p>Those born with fetal toxicity exhibit issues such as scabies, moist sores, abscesses, hard lumps, heavy or aberrant tongues, and oral sores, as well as feelings of heat or cold, jaundice, and fright associated with fetal conditions. Many newborns are afflicted by fetal toxicity-related ailments. For instance, issues such as umbilical wind or stubborn phlegm coughs can be difficult to treat; if a child has true convulsions at six months, that is ominous, while those with sores before a week are likely to die. Moreover, newborns have delicate stomachs and intestines, their blood and qi are insufficient, making it hard to introduce herbs or stones, and their defenses are weak with underdeveloped meridians, making acupuncture challenging. Practitioners should exercise caution!</p>
<p>When asked about the concept of fetal toxicity, I replied: the wise have discussed it thoroughly. After all, humans are born in a state of tranquility, which is the essence of nature. They are stirred by stimuli, which is the nature of the fetus. Desire is akin to fire.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Therefore, the delusions of thought arise as fire in the heart; the outburst of anger manifests as fire in the liver; the overflow of sorrow ignites as fire in the lungs; the indulgence in food and drink causes fire in the spleen; and the uninhibited desires spark fire in the kidneys. The fire of the five desires lies hidden within the maternal blood, and this is poison. In the act of sexual union, when the essence凝结, poison is also attached, which is the origin of the fetal poison. It is said that when a child is in the mother&#39;s womb, if hungry, it consumes the mother’s blood, and if thirsty, it drinks the mother’s blood. Once it breaks free from the womb, if there is residual blood in its mouth that is not cleaned properly and is swallowed into the belly, this is called fetal poison. Such words, once proposed by one person, are echoed by many, and none have sought to argue against them, which shows the unreliability of this text. The embryo begins from the father&#39;s essence; the body is nourished by the mother&#39;s blood.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>It is like water droplets dewy on flowers, as men and women gradually separate. The hair and bones, the form and essence are complete, and thus, born after a month. Initially, in the mother&#39;s womb, it resembles a chick nestled within an eggshell; what is there to eat or drink? The blood from the mouth comes as the mother delivers, and the lochia soaks into the mouth, not necessarily the blood from within the mother&#39;s womb. Once swallowed, it enters the large intestine, discharging through feces; how can it remain in the life gate waiting to emerge? </p>
<p>As for the red swellings and convulsions, consider their order: those with red appearing first and convulsions later are incurable; this is the poison of the fetus entering from the outside. However, if convulsions appear first and red follows, it is known as startled red and can be treated; this is the poison of the fetus coming from within and should be managed with a decoction of Lianqiao. </p>
<p>All sores in infants are due to fetal poison. The life gate refers to the right kidney.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Although it is said that men store essence and women bind the womb, there is hidden fire in the gate of life of parents. At the beginning of the embryo, the child receives this fire. After birth, this fire must manifest as abscesses, sores, rashes, scabies, and all kinds of vicious sores, which are termed &quot;fetal poison.&quot; The ancients established laws for newborns, including methods to cleanse the mouth and formulas of yellow root, licorice, and vermilion honey, all devised to detoxify. Later generations combined these three methods, using the umbilical cord and medicines, naming it &quot;Infant Nurturing Longevity Detoxification Pill.&quot;</p>
<p>In the treatment of red fibrous tumors by Dongyuan and the treatment of urinary dribbling by Danxi, there are detoxification methods found in &quot;Gzhiyu Lun,&quot; which must be broadly studied. </p>
<p>For newborns, there are &quot;Infant Nurturing Longevity Detoxification Pills&quot; that can resolve fetal poison. If there are sores and abscesses, there is a detoxifying soup for breastfeeding mothers to consume.</p>
<p>When a child develops red sores on the eyelid, with redness and swelling in the eyes, do not approach; they will surely die within three days. </p>
<p>If a child, one month old, is covered in scabies, soaked and rotten, with skin resembling peeling, crying day and night, and suddenly all the sores disappear, they will surely convulse and die. </p>
<p>Red tumors in children, the most severe fetal poison, are the red fibrous tumors, also known as &quot;dragon binding fire belt,&quot; a dire disease in children. Those above two years can be treated; those under a year or half a year are difficult to cure, with very few exceptions. The affected area appears swollen and hard, with a very red color, and should not be approached, as if it were being burned with flowing copper; if it spreads downwards from the head to the heart, death is certain, and if it spreads from the feet to the kidneys, death is also inevitable.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>In ancient methods of treatment, there is nothing to be taken; only the family tradition of the needle technique and the use of stone for dispelling malevolent energy and releasing toxic fire can achieve results, treating six or seven cases out of ten—truly a good method. The text states that &quot;blood that is full should be drained.&quot; One must never use cold or cooling medicines externally, as they can cause the toxic fire to become stagnant, leading to abdominal distension, pain, shortness of breath, anxiety, or convulsions, which results in certain death. It is advisable to use Tongsheng Powder, finely ground, soaked in wine and dried, then ground into a very fine powder, to be taken with honey water; externally, use Tongsheng Powder combined with honeysuckle vine leaves, boiled and used for baths—this method through water also releases stagnant fire. If the shock is treated before the redness, it can be cured; Tongsheng Powder is used primarily, or one may add Daohong Powder with honeysuckle, Scrophularia, Siler, and Schizonepeta to form pills. If redness is treated before shock, it cannot be cured.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>A child is born with itching and skin lesions all over their body, enjoying being massaged and patted. I have devised a prescription: using black snake wine to soak and dry the meat of a black snake, one qian; using bitter bergamot wine to soak and dry two qian; and frying sesame seeds and removing the thorns from white tribulus, each one and a half qian. Combine these into a powder, then make into pills with the soaked snake and bitter bergamot wine as a binder, and take with licorice soup for recovery. </p>
<p>When a child is newly born, if they have sores all over their body, as well as running sores and wind sores, these are all due to fetal toxin. Do not apply any medicines topically; it may cause the toxin to enter the abdomen. It is advisable to take sesame pills.</p>
<p>If there is a mistake in applying topical medicine, causing the toxin to enter the abdomen and resulting in abdominal distension, use the detoxifying pills as the main remedy.</p>
<p>If the head and face as well as the whole body develop sores, and they are not related to topical applications but suddenly heal, accompanied by phlegm and wheezing, one must not induce diarrhea; instead, treat it with honeysuckle decoction. The above cases are all related to fetal toxins, and moxibustion should not be used.</p>
<p>In the &quot;West River Moon,&quot; it says:<br>A child suffers from sores and scabs over their body, with pus and blood from insect nests. This is due to deeply hidden fetal toxins, hence there are many symptomatic manifestations. Cooling the blood, killing insects, and detoxifying with sesame pills is effective. Care should be taken to avoid applying topical drugs, which may bring the toxin back to the heart, causing abdominal pain, mental confusion, and potential death.</p>
<p>If topical medication is to be used, for itching, one should not exceed using wild rue (for insects beneath the surface). For insect-related issues, use sulfur; for pain, swelling, and cold water, that is appropriate. If it is not itchy, add dog spine herb and enjoy salt water with heated sulfur. Use caution, and apply what is effective, such as rubbing the hands and smelling at the nose.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Secrets of Infant Care</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty, Wanquan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dan Poison</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences spasms due to Dan Poison, the illness is located in the Shaoyang, and the Shaoyang pertains to the fire of the gallbladder. If spasms occur before the appearance of Dan tumors, this indicates that the toxic fire is emanating from within and can be treated. Conversely, if the tumors appear before the spasms, the poison has entered from the outside and is fatal. For those where the poison is from within, which is a residual fire, it is advisable to disperse and detoxify by using methods such as Feng Tong Sheng San, or employing a modified version of Sheng Ma Ge Gen Decoction.</p>
<p>For sores and abscesses causing spasms, this indicates prenatal poison. Infants may develop parasitic skin conditions, causing itching and pain, not knowing what medication to use. Internal detoxifying medicine and external applications of arsenious sulfur drugs may lead to a quick relief of sores, or in some cases, the sores may resolve without application. Signs of abdominal distension and constipation, lack of blood color in the skin, and inability to open the eyes while having spasms indicate a severe condition, necessitating urgent detoxifying medicine. The emergence of sores is necessary; failure to do so, coupled with difficulty breathing, leads to death. The main remedy is Xiong Huang Detoxicating Pill.</p>
<p>For infants under one year of age, regardless of whether it is sores, abscesses, or Dan tumors, if spasms occur, it is all difficult to treat, as their spleen and stomach are delicate, their digestive qi is not yet fully developed, making it hard to administer medicinal attacks.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Scabies and Eruptive Skin Conditions</strong> </p>
<p>In cases of dry scabies, treatment is possible with sesame seed pills as the main remedy. However, if the condition has become soaked and ulcerated, with no intact skin and the child crying day and night, treatment should not be attempted. It is absolutely forbidden to use arsenic, sulfur powder, or mercury as topical medications, as these toxic substances can enter the body through weakened areas and cause convulsions and difficulty breathing, leading to death. For children suffering from sores and scabies, it is advisable to use detoxification soup derived from the mother&#39;s milk as the main remedy. </p>
<p><strong>Erythema and Edema</strong> </p>
<p>Zhong Yang said: The heat and toxic energy become trapped in the pores, clash with the blood, and present as red spots on the skin. This results from the combination of heat toxins and blood, which allows wind energy to invade, causing red, swollen, and migrating rashes over the body. This condition often occurs when the wet nurse excessively consumes alcohol or fried foods, and when clothing is put on the child without allowing it to cool down. The rash may appear on the head, face, chest, or back, making the child irritable, bloated, and feeling like fire, causing indescribable pain. If it enters the abdomen or kidneys, the situation becomes irreparable. Additionally, within the first week of a child&#39;s life, their skin, muscles, bones, and internal organs are not yet firm; they are tender and weak, resembling the sprouting of grass and trees, unexposed to the elements. Thus, the newborn is referred to as a &quot;bud.&quot; During this first week, frequent bathing should be avoided, as it may cause the accumulation of damp heat that cannot easily dissipate.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>The body is covered in red spots and poisonous sores; if referred to as tumors, they appear like patches stained with rouge, all swollen and feeling hot. If the poison enters the abdomen, it causes swelling and hardness, leading to the death of the fetus, which is acquired through bathing. If the skin is loose and the pores are open, and if the body is wrapped improperly, it can be invaded by wind evil, resulting in the formation of white tumors, all swollen and hot, possibly accompanied by increased coldness and heat, nasal congestion, and head heaviness, or shortness of breath with phlegm and coughing, manifesting through various ailments—these are all caused by bathing or exposure. </p>
<p>To treat red tumors and poisonous sores, one may use a small knife to remove the tumor&#39;s red edges and the toxic blood pus. Then apply San Huang Powder, Ge Gen Bai Zhu Powder, or Xing Xiong Powder to focus the treatment. Fang Du San, Sheng Ma Decoction, or Fang Ji Powder may also be selected for use. Furthermore, for conditions of heat and excessive heat, as well as Long Dai heat, one can use Da Lian Qiao Decoction combined with Da Huang and Dang Shen to boil and take, which is notably effective.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Boils</strong></p>
<p>Chao stated: The boils in children arise from the invasion of wind and heat toxins, which attack the skin and lead to the production of pus, eventually resulting in sores; hence, they are called boils. The cow bile powder from Tang and the cleansing formula are used for treatment. There are also various types of boils, which may start as spots and later expose bone; the smaller ones are like millet or beans, while the more severe ones resemble plums or lichis, with colors ranging from red to black, green to white, changing frequently. They may appear in the mouth, around the navel, or on the arms and buttocks, without any specific location, often seen between the fingers. The roots penetrate deeply into the flesh, spreading in the arms and causing swelling, with toxic blood flowing through the tendons, leading to decaying flesh and exposed bones, resulting in excessive bleeding. This can drive individuals to madness, causing irritability, restlessness, and discomfort, all due to toxic energy attacking the heart. Applying powdered southern star, pinellia, and white atractylodes is advised. It is best to wash the area before applying the medicine. Various treatment principles should be broadly applied in the management of abscesses. Soap pods, blood residuals, and similar medicines are especially effective.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Boils and Carbuncles</strong></p>
<p>Tang said: These four conditions arise from the stagnation of blood and qi, allowing the pathogenic heat and toxins to accumulate, resulting in boils and carbuncles. Emergency formula: If a boil is in its early stage, showing a slight red bump with a hidden pain, urgently apply saliva to it frequently at midnight to disperse it. If it has already formed, use the Tianwu Powder as a poultice. If there are symptoms of internal restlessness and heat, one must take the Loulu Powder internally; it is a truly effective remedy. For severe heat, Qingdai Detoxifying Pill and Sishun Cool Drink with addition of Fangfeng, Lianqiao, and Heishen can also be taken; Wufu Detoxifying Pill is particularly good, and Lianqiao Decoction is also suitable. Cover with Qinglu Powder, leaving a small opening, then use Jingdu covering to close the wound for efficacy. For severe heat, Liangge Powder can also be taken.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p>
<h3>Malignant Neoplasm</h3>
<p>Chao said: A malignant neoplasm in children occurs when wind, heat, and toxic energy clash with blood energy, leading to the formation of stubborn knots that manifest in the neck. If exposed to wind and cold, they do not dissipate but turn into lymphatic nodes, which eventually ulcerate and become sores. For this condition, it is advisable to take cooling herbal decoctions such as Qingliang Yinzi and Shengma Decoction. There are various effective formulas for treating malignant neoplasms according to Tang&#39;s methods. Qianjin Lianqiao Pill and Longdan Decoction can both be taken.</p>
<h3>Rashes</h3>
<p>Rashes have two types: those caused by warm toxins and those resulting from gastric decay. The rashes due to warm toxins happen during warm winter months when individuals are exposed to an adverse atmosphere. If not immediately manifested as illness, they may be triggered in the spring by accumulated cold, preventing the release of toxic energy. As the weather warms, these warm toxins manifest, causing the muscles to rot and resulting in rashes resembling brocade patterns. The appropriate treatments include Ge Gen and Ju Pi Decoctions, and Huang Lian and Ju Pi Decoctions as primary remedies. </p>
<p>On the other hand, rashes resulting from gastric decay may appear before or shortly after an attack of illness. This is due to improper purging, allowing heat to invade the stomach; when purging is needed but not done, gastric heat fails to dissipate, resulting in rashes. In such cases, surface medicines should not be used, as the surface is weak while the interior is strong. If sweating is induced, it could aggravate the problem and worsen the rashes due to the surface weakness. The recommended treatments include Hei Shen Shengma Decoction and Huaban Decoction. </p>
<p>Rashes from a febrile illness indicate that heat is within the organs, attacking the intestines and stomach, resulting in internal sores before appearing externally. Red rashes are easier to treat, while black rashes are harder, due to the deeper invasion of toxic energy into the stomach. Qiang Huo Powder with Ciban is also suitable for treating rashes.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Skin Sores and Itches</strong></p>
<p>Tang states: When children are affected by dampness, stagnation of blood and qi can lead to sores. This often arises from parents and wet nurses not maintaining cleanliness, infrequent changing and washing of clothing and bedding, or neglecting to wash urine and feces for several days, which can also cause sores to develop. In mild weather, frequent bathing and changing of clothes, referred to as external cleansing, is sufficient, and there is no need for medicine. If a child must resort to medication, this is the last resort. Proper nurturing can prevent any ailment. Additionally, feeding should be regulated to avoid over-filling; the child&#39;s body should be like a well-cared-for plant, which is the principle of nourishment. </p>
<p>For bathing methods: in spring, use willow twigs and schizonepeta; in summer, use jujube leaves and locust branches; in autumn and winter, use bitter bush. Frequent bathing keeps the body comfortable, ensuring external cleansing and preventing illness. Jin Hua powder and other prescriptions for sores and itches may also be applied. Applying Mo Feng ointment to sores and itches is highly effective, alongside taking Qiang Huo powder with additions of Fang Feng and Schizonepeta, as well as recipes like Da Lian Qiao drink and Sheng Ma decoction.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>　　　　Authentic Practices of Surgery 【Ming Dynasty – Chen Shigong】</p>
<p>　　　　　Childhood Residual Toxicity and Ulcerative Spots</p>
<p>Residual toxicity refers to the remnants received in utero before birth. This occurs when parents suffer from conditions like yang mei sores, leaving behind lingering toxins that affect the essence and blood during conception. After birth, if the child is bathed in hot water and heated clothing is applied, the external heat will provoke the internal toxins to surface on the skin. Initially, red dots appear, followed by ulcerative spots; in severe cases, the corners of the mouth, genital area, eyes, and facial skin might all deteriorate, hindering breastfeeding and causing restlessness and crying. Early treatment is essential; administer a mixture of tu fu ling (smilax) powder and yellow essence in the mouth several times a day, about four to five portions. Externally apply the detoxifying Zi Jin Dan (Purple Gold Powder) to the affected areas. Those that respond effectively may have a survival rate of three or four out of ten; however, if treatment is delayed and the toxic condition worsens with widespread ulcerations, the chance of survival may drop to one or two out of a hundred. This is due to the depth of the toxin&#39;s roots.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Childhood Scarlet Fever</strong></p>
<p>Scarlet fever is contracted before birth, but symptoms appear after birth. While in the womb, a child relies on the father&#39;s essence and the mother&#39;s blood for nourishment. If the parents cannot control their desires, excessive heat can harm the fetus; moreover, they cannot avoid rich flavors or the warmth from coal and heavy bedding, which often causes heat to accumulate in the child. Once born, bathing in hot water, exposure to heated clothing, and the activation of internal toxins can trigger the disease. </p>
<p>When symptoms arise, the child first experiences fever, crying, and spasms; next, rashes appear that are red, swollen, bright, and hot, often moving quickly and unpredictably. If the rash starts on the forehead, it is named &quot;Heavenly Covering Powder,&quot; to be treated with a decoction of Rhubarb and Kudzu that both mother and child should consume. If the rash begins from the belly and back, spreading to the limbs, it is mild; if it originates in the limbs and spreads to the chest and belly, it is severe. </p>
<p>The treatment focuses initially on blood-letting to remove toxic blood. After blood-letting, slices of fatty pork should be placed on the affected area for a while, and then replaced with a golden powder mixed with juice from water banana roots. For severe cases, this should be changed twice a day. Internally, one can use a decoction of Lonicera japonica, a detoxifying mixture with rhinoceros horn, or a five-fruit detoxification pill. If toxicity leads to a hard, swollen belly without milk production, one should administer “Purple Snow Powder.” </p>
<p>Three days later, if the body gradually cools, the area where blood was drawn becomes soft and active, with clear sounds and normal milk production, then the recovery is on track; otherwise, it may be a sign of deterioration.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The infant tumor, or胎瘤, appears as a swelling on the newborn&#39;s head or between the chest and breast. The larger ones resemble steamed buns, while the smaller ones are similar to plums or dates. These are caused by stagnant blood from the fetus. One must wait until the child is one month old before using a needle to puncture it. If the contents resemble red bean juice, it is considered safe. Internally, administer the Five Blessings Detoxification Pill.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Childhood Impetigo</strong></p>
<p>Impetigo appears suddenly as yellow blisters on the head, face, ears, and neck. When these burst, they ooze fluid and can spread rapidly, causing pain and itching. This is often due to exposure to sun and wind, or from damp heat affecting the body, sometimes linked to consuming damp or hot foods. Treatment should involve the application of clam powder; using it will surely bring healing.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Ulcers and Diarrhea</strong></p>
<p>Persistent diarrhea arising from ulcers may occur due to excessive pus and blood loss, harming the spleen&#39;s qi; or due to diminished fire in the life-gate, preventing the generation of earth; or due to cold weakness in the spleen, which cannot regulate; or from kidney deficiency, failing to maintain; or due to the wetness and weakness of the nurse&#39;s spleen and stomach, causing issues for the child. If there is diarrhea accompanied by irritability and insomnia, it&#39;s indicative of spleen deficiency; treat with Dongyuan Shengyu Decoction. If diarrhea leads to dry mouth, it suggests stomach qi deficiency; use Qian’s Bai Zhu Powder. If there is persistent thirst and a need to drink water, heat in the stomach meridian may be present; treat with Dongyuan Xie Huang Powder. If diarrhea is yellow, with undigested food and abdominal pain, it indicates weak spleen qi; use Liu Jun and add Mu Xiang. If diarrhea is yellow, with a heavy, sinking sensation in the lower abdomen, or with an inability to pass stool after diarrhea, it signifies descending spleen qi; treat with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction. If diarrhea appears green, accompanied by decreased appetite and abdominal pain, this shows liver wood overpowering earth; use Liu Jun, Mu Xiang, Sheng Ma, and Chai Hu.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Mr. Dongyuan stated: When diagnosing the right guan pulse as string-like, it indicates that wind qi is injuring the spleen; use Shao Yao Gan Cao Decoction or similar remedies. If the right guan pulse is rapid, it suggests heat qi is injuring the spleen; use San Huang Pill or similar remedies. If the right guan pulse is weak, this indicates damp qi injuring the spleen; use Ping Wei San or similar remedies. If the right guan pulse is thin, it signifies dry qi injuring the spleen; use Yigong San with added Dang Gui, or Si Jun Zi Decoction with added Shu Di Huang or similar remedies. If the right guan pulse is deep and thin, it indicates cold qi injuring the spleen; use Yi Huang San, Li Zhong Wan, or similar remedies, adding Fu Zi for severe cold. Generally, if one drinks boiling hot soup and does not feel the heat, it signifies yang qi deficiency and cold; urgently use Si Jun Zi, Gui Zhi, and Fu Zi. If one drinks ice water and does not feel the cold, it signifies excessive yang qi and heat; urgently use cooling drinks or similar remedies. Additionally, if hands and feet are both cold, it indicates deficiency cold; use Wu Wei Yi Gong San with added ginger and cinnamon; if not effective, urgently add Fu Zi. If hands and feet are not warm, it indicates deficiency heat; use Wu Wei Yi Gong San or Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. If hands and feet are warm, it indicates excess heat; use Xie Huang San, as there are often recurring cases.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p>
<h3>Mumps</h3>
<p>Mumps belongs to the Yangming stomach channel of the foot, and the occurrence of abscesses is often due to children consuming sweet and rich foods, which causes heat accumulation in the spleen and stomach. There are also cases where the nursing mother’s anger affects the child. If caused by internal heat accumulation leading to obstruction of urination, use Liangge Powder; if due to wind invasion with normal urination, use Liu Lu Decoction; if there is wind-heat in the stomach channel or simultaneous throat swelling and pain, use Sheng Ma and Fang Feng Decoction.</p>
<h3>Ear Sores</h3>
<p>If one is constitutionally yin-deficient with fire affecting the chin, resulting in sores in or on both ears, or persistent pus discharge, it is advisable to use Di Huang Pill. If caused by the nursing mother&#39;s liver fire affecting the spleen, use modified Xiao Yao San; if there is heat accumulation in the spleen channel, use modified Gui Pi Decoction; if there is accumulated heat from rich foods, use Dong Yuan’s Qing Wei Powder; for wind-heat in the spleen and stomach, use Qing Yan and Li Ge Decoction. Additionally, refer to the treatment for mouth sores.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Rashes and Toxicity</h3>
<p>If the pulse is floating, the main focus is to dispel wind. If the pulse is floating and rapid, the focus is on dispelling wind and clearing heat. If the pulse is deep and rapid, the main focus is on draining heat. If the pulse is rapid but felt as deep and solid, it indicates a need to relieve the exterior and attack the interior.</p>
<h3>Surgical Experience Formulas [Ming Dynasty, Xue Ji]</h3>
<h3>Erysipelas</h3>
<p>In children, erysipelas often appears on the head, face, and limbs, exhibiting a red and wandering nature. Use magnetic powder to draw out the toxic blood; additionally, apply Shen Gong Powder, and internally administer Jing Fang Bai Du Powder or Wu Fu Hua Du Dan. Cases with abdominal involvement are not treated.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Surgical Heart Method</strong><br>[By Ming Dynasty - Xue Yi, source supplemented from &quot;Joint Directory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Books.&quot;]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Furuncles and Abscesses</strong></p>
<p>Li states: Young children, being purely Yang, often have excessive heat, with their heart Qi being obstructed and leading to many sores and lesions. If they consume too much fetal food, they will suffer from heat toxicity. Rhinoceros horn powder is the best remedy; the rest follows the usual methods, but excessive purging may harm their stomachs.</p>
<p><strong>Standards for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br>[By Ming Dynasty - Wang Kengtang]</p>
<p><strong>Sores and Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>The treatment for furuncles and abscesses is detailed in &quot;Standards for Ulcer Medicine.&quot; In children, although their bodies are weak and delicate, their nature is still innocent, and they rarely experience the five toxins or the diagnoses of the five excesses and seven deficiencies. Before and shortly after birth, sores may appear all over the body, and treatment is often avoided. Other small boils can be treated with topical applications for resolution. However, if there is excessive cold or heat, causing distress and harming the heart and abdomen, one must seek the underlying cause for treatment. For infants under breast care, both mother and child should receive treatment, and it is essential for the physician to possess insight and clarity, rather than simply following dogmatic methods. Xue has focused on the significant aspects of treating furuncles and abscesses, adding in childcare, which is akin to adding branches to a trunk. If one delves deeply into the source, clarifies the meridians, distinguishes exterior and interior conditions, and carefully observes patterns, there will be no difference in size; specialized texts exist, so there is no need for redundancy. This compilation focuses specifically on what is pertinent to children.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>In times of utmost danger and urgency, when lives are lost in an instant, nothing is more alarming than dan toxic lesions. Therefore, they are mentioned first and detailed separately. </p>
<p>Skin ulcers arise from imbalances in the internal organs, with blocked meridians leading to their formation. They may result from congenital toxins, or from wind transforming into parasites, or from excess heat, or from shock entering the skin. The most severe cases involve stagnation in the blood vessels, manifesting as lesions on the skin. If one restricts the flow of vital energy and blood, it can easily rupture; if it becomes entangled in wind, it leads to severe itching; or if external pathogens enter, it often causes widespread itching without resolution. Food toxins can stagnate and impair the blood and vital energy, eventually transforming into pus over time. Shock-induced ulcers derive from a mental disturbance with no tangible cause, causing a blockage of blood and energy in the organs, leading to skin eruptions that spread throughout the body, particularly affecting the limbs. Wind ulcers, also widespread and characterized by very small forms, are commonly referred to as scabs and heat toxins, emerging unpredictably as blood stagnates, resulting in lesions.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Worm nests and sores commonly appear on the back of the shins, creating nests where the worms resemble lice. This is due to roundworms in the abdomen transforming with the qi. The sores may recur, sometimes resembling tinea, and can cause intense itching and the presence of stagnant blood. Simply applying medicine externally may only affect the abdomen; one must remove the worms to heal and use anti-worm medication.</p>
<p>The Inner Canon states that all pains, itching, sores, and lesions relate to heart fire. The internal fire becomes stagnant, leading to such diseases. The heart governs the blood; when the blood becomes hot, it generates wind. Severe internal heat leads to a cycle of transmission, causing fire to generate earth, while blood fills the Yangming channel, which controls inner wind heat and the conflict of heat in the blood; thus, various skin manifestations occur. When it appears yellow and purulent, it signifies the earth generating metal, the mother returning to the child. Initially, it presents mild itching and slight heat; when swelling, pain, and ulceration occur, it indicates extreme heat causing blood to congeal and transform into fluid, resulting in stagnation that turns into pus. Symptoms may include alternating chills and fever and decreased appetite, which are particularly concerning.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>It is appropriate to vent the wind-heat, cool the heart, and relieve stomach heat, using a mixture of Angelica Decoction with Huang Lian, Sheng Ma, and Gan Cao, along with ginger, scallions, and light hemp for decoction; also apply Three Relief Powder, Burdock Soup, and Mu Tong Powder, externally using Four Huang Powder and Yi Mo Jin. </p>
<p>For a newborn with a block of blood, there are no tangible symptoms or pulse. If startled, it is the fetal fright; if there is heat, it is fetal heat. The infant is essentially one with the wet nurse; if there are sores, examine the wet nurse&#39;s liver channel for heat, treating it with Modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction; if there is deficiency heat in the liver channel, use Modified Xiao Yao San; if kidney water cannot generate liver, use Di Huang Pills; for accumulated heat in the heart channel, use Chai Hu and Zhi Mu Powder; if there is deficiency heat in the heart channel, use Fu Ling Heart-Strengthening Decoction; for accumulated heat from rich foods, use Dong Yuan&#39;s Clear Stomach Powder; if there is stagnant heat in the spleen channel, use Qian&#39;s Xie Huang Powder; if there is deficiency heat in the spleen channel, use Qian&#39;s Yi Gong Powder. </p>
<p>If Rhinoceros Horn Pills or Detoxifying Pills are taken, and cold cooling medicines are applied externally, it will harm the vital energy, leading to urgency in the condition.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Heat Toxic Sores</strong></p>
<p>Children develop sores due to consuming rich and heavy foods, or due to the emotional distress of their wet-nurses. If there is swelling, pain, and stagnation of qi and blood, one should use the Immortal&#39;s Life-Preserving Drink. If there is thirst and constipation, it indicates internal heat and toxin; one should use the Four Shun Cooling Drink, supplemented with the Sacred Cake. If the swelling is hard and red, indicating a gathering of heat and toxin, one should use the Life-Preserving Drink, supplemented with garlic moxibustion. If the swelling is hot and fails to subside, threatening to form pus, use the Tuo Li Xiao Du Powder; if pus does not form or if it does form but does not rupture, indicating stagnation of qi and blood, use the Eight Treasures Decoction. If there is an opening and the flesh is red and does not heal, indicating spleen blood deficiency, use the Four Substances, ginseng, and atractylodes. If the flesh is white and does not heal, indicating spleen qi weakness, use the Four Gentlemen, chuanxiong, and angelica. If there is reduced appetite and fatigue with non-healing, indicating spleen qi deficiency, use the Six Gentlemen, angelica, and drinks of elevating herbs. Generally, with proper medication matched to the symptoms, there is nothing that cannot be cured. If one rashly attacks the toxin, resulting in a loss of vital energy, it will lead to severe conditions that are difficult to treat. In general, sores related to the bowels are easier to treat; if there is no loss of vital energy, they can heal on their own. Those associated with the organs are more difficult to treat, and if there is a loss of vital energy, they may transform into severe conditions. Misusing aggressive treatments leads to a loss of vital energy, making healing even harder; thus, it is crucial to avoid using harsh medications. Observing the teachings of Dongyuan and Danxi: when swelling and pain appear, along with signs of weak pulses, one must administer tonics; if blood and qi are not deficient, healing can be assured; however, if one uses methods to expel the evil toxins, one may inevitably encounter the dangers of deficiency.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Dandruff</strong></p>
<p>In &quot;The Treasure Mirror for Infants,&quot; the song about children&#39;s dandruff says: When the fire of red is first begun, it seems like burning flames, the heavenly fire turning the body red. The fire from the edges is dark bluish, with symptoms sprouting from the forehead. The hips along the groin area burn with dandruff, resembling a red band in fiery spurts. When the fire is strong, it reaches its peak in a day, changing unpredictably among five colors. The home fire connects to the cheeks and both armpits, while the heavenly oven affects the ankles and the lower body. The back and knees present with a red flying dandruff, and the groin&#39;s navel area invites the urinary discharge.</p>
<p>Cao Shi says: The signs of fiery dandruff come and go like a febrile illness, reddening the body and gradually increasing. He further states: The appearance of fiery dandruff is red like it is burning, with rapid bursts of eruptions. </p>
<p>In &quot;The Infant Formulas,&quot; it is stated: Fire dandruff comes and goes like febrile illnesses, reddening the body, not derived from burned fire and thus named; it resembles the sun at its rise, hence also known as solar dandruff. It is advisable to use the Qianjin Loulu Powder simultaneously.</p>
<p>The scripture states: Red and purple nodules, all stem from internal heart fire, manifesting as red as cinnabar.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The heart governs the blood and has a fiery nature. When the blood becomes hot and clashes, and yin becomes stagnant in yang, this results in the onset of toxic rash. When the heart is deficient and cold, there is itching; when the heart is full and hot, there is pain. First, use Bai Jie San to release the exterior, then take Dang Gui San with Lian Qiao and Jing Jie&#39;s decoction, along with Niu Bang Tang mixed with fried flaxseed, to help clear heat and expel toxins. Following that, Chi Ge San may be used, or initially, Hua Dan Tang is also suitable.</p>
<p>In cases where there are rashes on the body, the symptoms are similar to those described earlier, not excessively dry or itchy, but presenting as raised spots over the body, along with a state of dizziness and discomfort, known as yin toxic symptoms. First, use Chong He Yin with Nan Mu Xiang, ginger, and water to decoct and take; next, apply Dang Gui San and Xiong Huang San. Both of these symptoms do not discriminate between red and white; if it enters the abdomen or kidneys, it can cause significant harm and should not be treated lightly, as it could bring distress.</p>
<p>Generally, while there are various forms of toxic rash, the source of the illness is singular. For those with red rashes covering the body that itch, especially among young girls aged fifteen or sixteen whose menstrual flow has not yet started, rashes may develop due to wind-toxic blood; it is advisable to take Fang Ji San. </p>
<p>For children with black spots, red spots, itchy sores, or urticaria, Fang Feng Tong Sheng San should be used for treatment.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Fetal Toxin Eruption</strong></p>
<p>The eruption of fetal toxin occurs when the toxin lies hidden within. This can be caused by frequent baths in hot water, wearing heated clothing, or the nursing mother’s diet influenced by emotions, which generate internal heat, exacerbating the condition. It manifests on the head, face, and limbs, spreading to the chest and abdomen, with a red color that moves unpredictably. The ancients said: Those who experience onset from the limbs into the abdomen are all difficult to treat. One should urgently have the afflicted suck the toxic blood from the affected areas, gathering it in one place to be needled out, and then immediately take a lifesaving decoction. However, avoid needling within the hundred days, as the muscles are fragile at that time. If the eruption is caused by excessive dispersing treatments, resulting in superficial heat that does not subside, use the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Fang Feng and Bai Zhi; if it is caused by excess cooling, with injured stomach Qi and persistent heat, use the Yi Gong San with added Chai Hu and Sheng Ma; or if there are concurrent symptoms of spasms, use Si Jun, Sheng Ma, Dang Gui, and Diaoteng Gou. If one continues to use toxic purges, it will lead to further complications. For those affected on the forehead, they should lie down and receive needling treatment.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Harm from Food Leading to Rashes</strong></p>
<p>Harm from food leading to rashes occurs when the energy of the spleen and stomach is fully engaged, yet an excess of dairy and food cannot be transformed, causing heat to accumulate inside and surface on the skin. If food stagnation from dairy persists, first use Baohuan pills to disperse it; if there is constipation, increase the dosage of Da Huang to facilitate bowel movements. Once food is digested but rashes continue to appear, treat it with Qingzhong Jieyu Decoction; if the rashes persist and there is no desire for food after the heat is removed, use Wuwei Yigong Powder to nourish. If there is fever and thirst, or a reduced appetite, use Qiwwei Baizhu Powder to replenish. Generally, rashes caused by heavy or rich foods lead to a red halo that spreads slowly; however, if caused by drinking liquor or mistakenly swallowing foreign objects, the redness spreads quickly. There are also cases of sores with redness around them, where heat dissipates or pus discharges spontaneously. In all these cases, needling is to be avoided, and calming methods should be prioritized, with no aggressive treatments. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs, do not stop it, as these symptoms have a dispersing effect. For those who drink liquor, taking a cup or two of cold rice vinegar can be a miraculous remedy. In cases where mothers excessively consume roasted rich foods, drink liquor, or take spicy and drying medicines, or if liver and spleen are harmed by pent-up anger, leading to ailments in their children, one should treat it as a case of fetal heat and poisonous sores.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br><strong>Jing Dan</strong></p>
<p>Within a hundred days of a baby&#39;s birth, particularly after six months, if the eyes appear red with slight swelling, the face shows a bluish-dark hue, and the baby cries restlessly at night, or if the face resembles rouge, this indicates inner heat. There are also instances where the face does not turn red. This initially stems from the mother experiencing a severe shock during pregnancy, which harms the fetus and transmits illness, manifesting outwardly. Initially, this conditions presents widely across the face in a manner resembling chickenpox, with slightly red feet that are not inflamed, exhibiting erratic patterns of rise and fall, and extending to the neck, bright red like vermilion, known as Jing Dan. It is treated with Four Sacred Powder; first, wash the eyes; then, boil Baijie Powder combined with Wuhuo Decoction, to alleviate the shock-induced heat and toxicity. Burdock soup, Angelica Powder, Sanjie Powder, and Huangqins&#39; Four Ingredients Decoction can also be used for treatment. If Jing Dan spreads to the chest and armpits leading to phlegm and wheezing, it is urgent to dispel heat and draw out toxins to prevent internal harm. Use Wuhuo Decoction with added Shengma and raw Rehmannia, boiled with ginger and the heart of lantern, to eliminate it; continue using the aforementioned medicines without causing other issues. Alternatively, administer Wan&#39;an Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Wuse Dan</strong></p>
<p>The five-colored Dan in children arises from the changes in the Dan, manifesting inconsistently in colors like blue, yellow, white, black, and red. This is due to the heat from wind toxins, which can be intense or mild, hot or cold, leading to the occurrence of the five-colored Dan. The Kong family passes down a method of using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, prepared according to regulations, with the residue applied on the Dan for effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Bai Dan</strong><a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>White Dan refers to the presence of cold wind, which causes the color to be white. Initially, it manifests as itching and pain, with slight swelling akin to blown milk; it is neither painful nor red, but white in color.</p>
<p>Red Dan is caused by the heaviness of wind toxicity, resulting in a red color. It initially appears as large as a coin or as small as a bean, with grains forming on the flesh, resembling the color of a chicken&#39;s comb, therefore also called Zhu Yu Dan.</p>
<p>Black Dan comes from wind toxins injuring the muscles, resulting in a black color. It initially manifests as itching and pain, or it may swell slightly and appear black.</p>
<p>Heavenly Fire Dan appears in children as red spots on the flesh, with the larger ones the size of a hand. In severe cases, the entire body may break out in red and itch, hence named Heavenly Fire Dan.</p>
<p>Red Flow refers to patches of red on a child&#39;s body that resemble rouge, and it spreads gradually; this is called Dan poison, commonly known as flow. If it arises from heat, the color will be red, and if from wind, it will be white; both conditions are swollen and fevers arise. One may use a scalpel to drain the bad blood. If the poison has not entered the abdomen, it can still be treated.</p>
<p>Red areas on the body occur in children as a result of sweating, being harmed by wind and heat toxins, causing a clash with blood and energy, leading to the evaporation of heat and resulting in red and feverish flesh.</p>
<p>Wang&#39;s prohibition of Earth Ghost Dan and Snake Coiling Dan.</p>

<li>Hulou Dan: Begins with yellow swelling in the groin area; use earth from a leaking roof mixed with sheep fat for application.</li>
</ol>
<p>These ten types of toxic swellings are not to be taken lightly; if treatment is delayed, it can lead to severe consequences. Therefore, I do not hesitate to offer these methods, as identifying each one carefully and treating them accordingly will yield nearly perfect results. If treatment is not applied within three days, it can invade the internal organs and become untreatable, so prompt action is essential.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br><strong>Red and White Swelling</strong></p>
<p>Children with weak muscles are affected by the invasion of wind, toxins, and heat. When heat and toxins attack the blood and qi, the skin becomes red and swollen. The wind moves restlessly with the qi; thus, it is named &quot;swelling that travels.&quot; </p>
<p>Moreover, the appearance of this traveling swelling includes shades of green, yellow, red, and white, with no fixed color, moving between the layers of the skin, and a slight glow on the flesh. </p>
<p>To treat this traveling swelling, take a piece of raw linen, dip it in oil, ignite it with fire, and hold it over the affected area while chanting: &quot;Day moves, day moves, not knowing the grease, fire burns your head!&quot; Repeat the incantation seven times, and it will heal.</p>
<p>It is also said: In extreme cold conditions, do not exceed the use of algae. However, if there is a heat-related swelling or toxin, take the algae from the water, finely chop it, cook it, and then mash it, applying it thickly—about three-tenths of an inch—over the affected area. Change it when it dries. </p>
<p>I believe this should not be applied directly; if the toxin is on the surface, it may be dealt with, but if suppressed, it will not be released, and may enter deeper. It is essential to first take a purgative to address the internal condition before applying this.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Identifying the Signs of Scarlet Fever in Infants</strong></p>
<p>In newborn infants, the stored fetal heat may manifest as scarlet fever, which will first be observable externally, though people may not notice it. If a baby in swaddling shows excessive eye discharge without any apparent cause, this indicates a potential outbreak of scarlet fever. If there is also slight wheezing or rapid breathing, the toxic condition has worsened and is affecting the lungs. Upon noticing these signs, it is urgent to mix dragon&#39;s brain with water and give it to the child, or use medicines such as indigo root or rhinoceros horn to gradually eliminate the poison. If the body already shows red spots, then further external treatments with substances like mustard greens should be applied, following a gradual and systematic approach to treatment. In my family, both of my sons had thick eye discharge at birth and subsequently developed scarlet fever. There is also a case of a certain official&#39;s granddaughter, who at seven days old had abundant eye discharge, and later developed a small red spot like a coin in her lower abdomen, which gradually spread upward to the heart, leading to her death. This is crucial knowledge. Initially, it was believed that if scarlet fever developed within a hundred days, it would be fatal and untreatable; however, there are cases that can be treated and should not be neglected.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>Taboos</strong></p>
<p>Generally, when a child suffers from swelling and inflammation, even if the condition seems serious, one must not hastily use strong laxatives like Da Huang or Mang Xiao, for fear that toxins may invade the interior and take control, making treatment difficult. Instead, one should use mild, detoxifying herbs that regulate the internal organs, facilitating gentle movement and benefits. This approach protects the vital energy while expelling external pathogens, thereby ensuring overall well-being. There was a case of a half-year-old child with swelling, for whom a doctor improperly administered Qing Jin Dan, leading to excessive purging, retention of toxins internally, and resulting in wheezing, agitation, and death. Infants have delicate skin and are easily affected by both deficiency and excess, and they cannot tolerate many medications. Therefore, treatment must not be taken lightly, nor should one act impulsively; it all relies on meticulous care and attention to ensure safety. Many in the world do not know this, hence the need for thorough documentation and advice.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>If a young child has scarlet fever, one must anticipate that the condition may extend to the throat, neck, abdomen, and other vulnerable areas. One can apply ointment to protect those areas and use a needle to draw it towards the point of occurrence, allowing any bad blood to escape and relieve the toxicity. Some believe that it is necessary to scrape off the bad blood completely with a comb until clear, yellow fluid emerges, which is appropriate only for those with vigorous energy and hot blood. Generally, this illness varies in severity; older children with strong vital energy can endure it better, while infants under one month who contract it severely may not be suitable for this method. It is crucial to note that a child, two years old, named Zhang Kangdao, died two days after undergoing treatment with acupuncture that drew out toxic blood. It should not be ignored.</p>
<p>The “Compendium of Materia Medica” states that for adults and children suffering from scarlet fever, eating crucian carp and jellyfish (known as &quot;sea stingers&quot;) is beneficial. However, one must not overindulge in these foods, as doing so can lead to harm. Crucian carp is a type of fish that is generally safe to consume.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br><strong>Forbidden Method</strong></p>
<p>Master Song Cheng from the Namta Monastery transmitted the method of prohibiting fire for the refinement of Dan (elixir): Use five torches, as thin as chopsticks, lighting one end with fire. Hold it in your right hand, pinching the section between the second and third fingers with your thumb, and do similarly with your left hand; stand facing north, quietly envisioning the northern water of Ren and Gui, vast and boundless. Inhale completely, then blow onto the fire, imagining once more and blowing again, repeating this three times. Test the fire by bringing it towards your mouth; if it does not burn you, then use the torch fire to pass over a child once, also passing over the Dan in a cross pattern. If you test and find it burns and hurts, focus again on inhaling water. This should be practiced on New Year’s Day and the Dragon Boat Festival. </p>

<pre><code>      Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment 【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang】

           Boils
</code></pre>
<p>Boils are the most severe among all sores. They can be fatal quickly. The ancients say: there are twelve types of boils, each different; among them, thirty-six are critical, and once they reach their full count, they become incurable; there are also cases where one dies without reaching that count due to the dispersal of toxic gases. If the pox virus infects a person, appearing on the head and face or spreading all over the body, it is not of this type. In children, these often arise from the mother consuming toxic foods, the child accidentally ingesting poisonous substances, or being affected by improper seasonal climates, all of which can lead to this condition. These sores mostly appear on the head, face, and limbs, with varied shapes and colors; they may resemble small sores, blisters, be painful, itchy, or associated with numbness. External symptoms include chills and fever, vomiting, and nausea, with tightness in the limbs. The main approach is to determine if the pathogen is on the surface or internal, and promptly use the method of burning garlic as a moxibustion technique, along with detoxifying agents.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>If one does not regain consciousness, their jaw tightly clenched, one should urgently grind a life-saving pill to powder and mix it with hot wine to administer. If one consumes raw or cold substances, or if one is doused with cold water, the milder cases will struggle to recover, while the more severe cases will not be curable. Those affected in the legs often have red threads reaching the navel; those in the arms often have red threads reaching the heart; those within the lips and mouth often have red threads reaching the throat. Quickly use needles to extract the bad blood to release the poison, which can ensure safety. In remote areas where medicine is hard to reach, moxibustion has the power to revive; if harsh and drastic medicines are taken, it will only worsen the danger. Children’s muscles are delicate and they cannot express whether they feel pain, so when applying moxibustion, one must cut garlic into thin slices and place them on the skin, slightly hollowing out a space, then ignite the moxa on the garlic, first testing the heat on an adult&#39;s arm to ensure it is suitable, and then moving it to the sore; also prepare additional moxa in the same manner for testing before switching, without allowing pauses.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Seasonal Toxins</strong></p>
<p>In children, seasonal toxins arise from the improper energies of the four seasons, leading to redness and swelling of the nose, face, ears, neck, or throat, accompanied by chills, fever, and headaches. In severe cases, there may be confusion and restlessness, and a feeling of throat obstruction, resembling typhoid fever, which can be fatal within five to seven days. If the pulse is floating and rapid, the pathogen is on the surface; if the pulse is deep and slippery, the pathogen is internal. For surface ailments, one should use the Ge Gen Niu Bang Zi Decoction; for internal issues, the Zhi Zi Ren Decoction; if both surface and internal are affected, the Xi Jiao Sheng Ma Decoction is recommended. In severe cases, one should apply acupuncture and use dispersing remedies to expel the toxin, which will resolve in a matter of days. If the condition does not improve and pus begins to form, use the Tuo Li Xiao Du San; if constriction is desired, use the Tuo Li San. If swelling of the throat prevents speech or swelling of the head prevents eating, death is certain.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br><strong>Flowing Accumulation</strong></p>
<p>In young children, flowing accumulation occurs when qi flows and stagnates, blood accumulates and clots, indicating a deficiency of the vital essence. This may result from falls or injuries, from liver fire rising, from the six excesses invading internally, from spleen deficiency and food accumulation, or from congenital factors. It can manifest in the limbs and joints, causing issues in the chest, abdomen, waist, and hips. Symptoms may include nodules, swelling, or pain. All should be treated with scallion poultices, focusing on reinforcing the vital essence as the priority. For falls or injuries, use the Blood-Settling Pain Pill; for liver fire, the Nine-Flavor Aloe Pill; for food accumulation, the Four-Flavor Child&#39;s Pill. Medicines can correspond to symptoms, resolving issues before they become serious or allowing existing problems to dissipate on their own. If pus forms but does not discharge, it indicates a deficiency of the vital essence, requiring nourishment and acupuncture to prevent toxic qi from attacking internally and blood qi from collapsing. If pus discharges but the pain worsens, it indicates a deficiency of qi and blood; use the Eight Treasure Decoction. If nausea occurs with reduced appetite, it indicates stomach qi deficiency; use the Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is a desire to vomit but no appetite, or if the abdomen feels bloated, it indicates spleen qi deficiency; use the Six Gentlemen Decoction. If there are severe muscle spasms and rigidity of the mouth, it indicates extreme deficiency of qi and blood leading to a change in symptoms; use the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction. If there are signs of internal heat and afternoon heat, it indicates deficiency of yin and blood; use the Four Substances, Ginseng, Astragalus, and Atractylodes. If there is exterior heat with aversion to cold, it indicates deficiency of yang qi; use the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction. For fluctuating heat, or if symptoms appear in the daytime and disappear at night, or vice versa, it indicates deficiency heat and requires a substantial replenishment of vital essence. If there is redness and swelling with thick pus, treatment is still possible; if there is hardness without redness, or if the pus is clear, or if the pulse is large and rapid, accompanied by thirst with cold and heat, and a lack of response to nourishment, these conditions are treatable.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>Heavenly Serpent Poison</strong></p>
<p>A sore on the fingertip, commonly known as Heavenly Serpent Poison. Each of the five fingers has its own meridian: the thumb belongs to the Lung Meridian of the Hand, the index finger to the Large Intestine Meridian of the Hand, the middle finger to the Pericardium Meridian of the Hand, the ring finger to the Sanjiao Meridian of the Hand, and the little finger to the Heart Meridian of the Hand. There are also afflictions on the feet: the big toe corresponds to the Liver and Spleen Meridians, the second toe to the Gallbladder Meridian, and the little toe to the Bladder Meridian. Each should be treated according to the meridian and its cause of affliction. </p>
<p>The cause may be due to accumulated heat in the stomach, rich foods from nursing mothers, dampness and heat flowing down, or external wind and poison. Generally, it is often due to the deficiency of the Three Yin Meridians in the feet, allowing the evil to enter. </p>
<p>In the initial stages of swelling and pain, first use the Xianfang Huoming Decoction, then follow with the Toli Xiaodu Powder. If the vital energy sinks and there is heavy pain that does not rupture for a long time, use the Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. If one takes the Baidu Powder and applies cooling remedies, the sore may turn black, or flesh may protrude, or the fingers may turn black. </p>
<p>In general, the hands and feet are areas where qi and blood have difficulty reaching. The hands relate to the stomach, and the feet to the spleen; therefore, one should not damage their true qi. Danxi noted that in the buttocks, where circulation of qi and blood is rare, let alone in the extremities. Therefore, cooling and depleting medicines should be used with great caution.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br><strong>Heavenly Blisters</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly blisters appear like water bubbles and are associated with wind-heat in the lung and stomach meridians. If there is fever and pain, the pathogenic factor is at the surface, and one should use Ginseng Dispersing Toxin Powder. If there is fever and coughing, the pathogenic factor is in the lungs, and one should use a modified Xiao Feng San (Disperse Wind Powder). If there is thirst and constipation, the pathogenic factor is internal, and one should use a modified Clear Cool Drink. For skin conditions like this, toxins must be eliminated; one may use Golden Yellow Powder or apply Huangbo (Phellodendron) and earthworms. Angelica ointment is also effective. Once stable, there is no need for medication. However, if excessive attacking has led to a deficiency of vital energy and the emergence of other conditions, one should seek treatment from various schools.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br><strong>Yangmei Sores</strong></p>
<p>Yangmei sores are a seasonal poison that manifests at certain times; they can also be transmitted. Some individuals are predisposed, with evidence in the liver, hence they often arise in the lower parts of the body. Improper treatment can lead to injuries to the eyes, decay of the kidneys, and deformities of the limbs and joints. In the early stages, if there are many sores on the upper body, one should initially use Jingfang Baidu Powder; if there are many on the lower body, start with Longdan Xiegan Decoction. For constipation, begin with Dalianqiao Drink, followed by Huanzhi Xiaoduo Powder. If there are injuries to the eyes, use Jiumei Luhui Pills and Liuwai Dihuang Pills concurrently; if there are contractions in the limbs, also use Juanbi Jiedu Decoction. If it is unable to heal due to deficiency in the spleen and stomach, start with Yigong Powder, then use Huanzhi Xiaoduo Powder. If using light powders, it may often lead to adverse effects. </p>
<p>(Note: Yangmei sores primarily occur in modern times, often transmitted by unclean women involved with promiscuous men. In children, those who contract it through breastfeeding are generally mildly affected; those who inherit it from parents are severely affected. The treatment methods are similar to those for adults, but should be approached with specialized care.)<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p>
<h3>Wang Lan Chuang (King&#39;s Rot)</h3>
<p>When a child has heat in the internal organs, the heat affects the skin, and if dampness invades from the outside, sores will appear. If the heat is particularly strong, the sores will also manifest vigorously, initially appearing like small sesame seeds, and soon oozing large amounts of fluid, decaying as if burned by fire, hence named Wang Lan Chuang.</p>
<h3>Hong Si Chuang (Red Thread Sores)</h3>
<p>There is a type of sore known as Hong Si Chuang, which, although not a dan zhan (red sore), possesses a similar poison. It often appears on the knuckles of the middle fingers, more severely on the left for males and the right for females. Its appearance is that of a clear, shiny water bubble, about the size of a small chick&#39;s head, with dozens of tiny needle-like holes underneath, causing no itch or pain, posing no issue. The edge of the bubble has a red thread-like vein subtly visible beneath the skin, which moves very quickly; if it travels up to the elbow, it becomes dangerous, and if it reaches the heart, it can be fatal. For those with this symptom, urgent treatment involves puncturing the head of the sore with a needle or sealing it with chewed white plum, halting the movement of the thread.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br><strong>Evil Kernels of Scrofula</strong></p>
<p>Scrofula, an ailment, was previously called &quot;Nine Leaks&quot; by ancient sages. Its cause appears to be heat, and its manifestations are varied, merely named according to their appearance. Generally, it begins between the muscles of the neck, and if not yet suppurated, it can be alleviated by drawing out the core, using acupuncture, moxibustion, or topical applications, tailored to the underlying cause. However, young children are too weak for needles and heat, so medicinal formulations for ingestion and topical application are used instead. This disease often arises behind the ears and on both sides of the neck, initially presenting as a single bump, which then usually proliferates into multiple bumps of various sizes, encircling the neck like a string of pearls. Each bump swells first and then suppurates. Mild cases can heal, while severe ones are difficult to treat. If the kernels leak pus for many years without drying up, it is referred to as &quot;Leaky Neck.&quot; The initial occurrence of the disease results from the three Yang patterns receiving wind and heat, which clash with blood and qi. Treatment involves a formulation like Bai Jie San combined with Dang Gui San, taken as a decoction with water, ginger, scallions, and lotus heart; followed by the use of Yuan Shen drink, Burdock soup, Mu Tong powder, and Nei Xiao pills to disperse heat and transform toxins; washing with Quercus powder, applying Bai Ji powder and Er Xiang powder to promote the movement of blood and qi. Once the pus has dried up and the essence is exhausted, healing will occur. Moreover, one should avoid consuming toxic wild foods to prevent recurrence. Heat-toxicity scrofula originates from the hand-foot Shaoyang and foot Jueyin meridians due to wind and heat, or may stem from liver abscesses and dietary accumulation. Symptoms manifest in the neck, armpits, or around the ears, resembling a string of pearls, and one must discern between exterior and interior conditions of deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>If there is redness and swelling, it indicates heat toxin in the liver channel; use Shen Shen Bai Du San. For pain accompanied by cold and heat, it indicates internal liver fire; use Jia Wei Xiao Chai Hu Tang. If there is no pain but the urine is yellow, it indicates liver blood deficiency; use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. If it is hidden in the flesh without color change, it indicates internal liver sores; use Jiu Wei Lu Hui Wan. If pus forms but does not drain, or drains but does not heal, it indicates spleen qi deficiency; use Yi Qi Yang Rong Tang. </p>
<p>In general, for swelling, pain, and thirst with cold and heat, it belongs to excess disease qi and insufficient body qi; it is advisable to clear liver fire and generate liver blood. For hard swelling that does not drain, or drains but does not heal, it belongs to both deficient disease qi and body qi, and treatment should supplement kidney water and strengthen the spleen. If it is due to anger from a wet nurse, resulting in liver fire affecting the patient, treatment should be directed according to the cause.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>The convulsions caused by the wind are associated with the liver and gallbladder channels. The interaction of the wind and wood with fire shows that when wood is strong, it produces wind, leading to heat and dryness in the blood, which causes the condition of spasms and disturbances. This occurs because the wind increases the liver fire, which in turn consumes the liver blood. Insufficient blood fails to nourish the tendons, resulting in contractions and knots similar to pearls.</p>
<p>The sides of the neck are specifically related to the liver and gallbladder channels. Treatment should focus on nourishing kidney water, clearing liver fire, nurturing yin blood, and strengthening the spleen&#39;s earth aspect. When kidney water is abundant, liver fire naturally diminishes; when liver fire is cleared, yin blood is generated. The generation of yin blood calms the fire, and when the fire is calmed, it does not harm the original qi, preventing diseases from fire overpowering the earth.</p>
<p>Regarding congenital toxins causing scrofula, this arises from stagnation of liver and gallbladder fire. The liver and gallbladder channels travel along the side of the body, and if affected by liver fire, it manifests in that area. Therefore, one must carefully analyze the cause and apply the right medication. If it results from the anger of the wet nurse or from blood deficiency leading to internal heat, one must adjust the mother’s condition accordingly, avoiding harsh medications for fear of damaging the original qi.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br><strong>Ulcers and Scabs</strong></p>
<p>Children’s meridians store heat, causing ulcers to form on the head, face, and body. For treatment, use the Four Noble Herbs, adding half a coin&#39;s worth of Trichosanthes root and Platycodon root, and decoct for consumption. When children have skin ulcers in warm weather, frequent washing and changing clothes is helpful, referred to as external dispelling. It is not advisable to take medicine unless absolutely necessary, as this is a purging method. If proper nourishment is maintained, no illness can invade. Breastfeeding should be regulated, avoiding overfeeding, which is the principle of health preservation. </p>
<p>Toxin-based ulcers and scabs arise from inherited fetal heat or food toxins consumed by the mother during pregnancy, along with emotional heat. Initially resembling dry eczema, they later produce pus and water, possibly forming patches. They may occur between the eyebrows or around the ears, corresponding to the Shaoyang channel; if on limbs, it relates to the Spleen and Stomach channel; on the sides, it relates to the Liver channel; on the forehead, to the Heart channel; on the brain, to the Bladder channel; and on the chin and cheeks, to the Kidney channel. Treatment should align with the corresponding channels and the balance of the five organs, considering factors like the mother&#39;s diet and emotions. Care must be taken not to hastily use detoxifying methods or medicines such as rhinoceros horn, as this may further harm the vitality and complicate the condition, making it difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Heat toxin-based ulcers and scabs are caused by premature breastfeeding, a preference for rich and fatty foods leading to accumulation of heat in the organs, or by heavy, rich food consumed by the mother, or excessive emotional heat. It is essential to identify the organ-related causes of the condition, assess its deficiency or excess, and regulate the blood and qi to harmonize defiance. For excess heat in the Liver channel, use Chai Hu Qing Gan San; for deficiency heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For excess heat in the Heart channel, use Dao Chi San; for deficiency heat, use Bu Xin Tang.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>For excess heat in the spleen channel, use Xie Huang San; for deficiency heat, use Bu Zhong Tang. For excess heat in the lung channel, use Xie Bai San; for deficiency heat, use Wu Wei Yi Gong San. For kidney heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. Generally, cold hands and feet are considered to be deficiency cold, while hot hands and feet are considered to be excess heat. If the pulse is deep, rapid, and strong, with thirst for cold drinks, and dry, hard stools, it indicates internal evil, which should be expelled internally; if the pulse is floating, rapid, and strong, with thirst for cold drinks, it indicates evil on the surface, which should be dispersed. If the pulse is floating, large, and weak when pressed, or if there is thirst for broth, with reduced appetite for milk and food, this indicates deficiency of qi leading to heat. Regulating the spleen and stomach will lead to recovery; avoid using cold and cool remedies to prevent harming the true qi. For infants, treatment should focus on adjusting the diet of the nursing mother.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Various sores and skin diseases occur due to the deficiency of the spleen and stomach, leading to the loss of bodily fluids and the uncontrolled movement of empty heat. This may also result from the six evils and seven emotions affecting the wet nurse, as well as improper diet and lifestyle affecting the child, causing illness. It is important to identify the causes, examine the patterns, and bring balance. </p>
<p>For symptoms like a pale complexion with a mix of cold and heat, or white spots obstructing vision, these indicate liver dysfunction; a red face with fever or thirst and palpitations suggests heart dysfunction; a yellow face with thin body or thirst and diarrhea points to spleen dysfunction; a pale face with coughing or sores in the nose relates to lung dysfunction; and a dark complexion with thin body or preference for sleeping on damp ground signifies kidney dysfunction. Infants should be treated by regulating their wet nurse.</p>
<p>If the five organs&#39; strengths and weaknesses are not assessed correctly, and if the symptoms of empty and full conditions are not understood, rash treatments can worsen the situation and lead to dire consequences.</p>
<p>For treating skin lesions: for immersed sores, apply a bitter gourd powder; for dry eczema, use the squeezed juice of goat’s hoof root mixed with fine powder; for wet eczema, use blue gold powder as a patch.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br><strong>Rashes</strong></p>
<p>Jie Gu said: The disease of rashes occurs when there is swelling on the outside, which belongs to the fire of the lesser yang, referred to as &quot;spots;&quot; small red patches hidden beneath the skin belong to the fire of the lesser yin, referred to as &quot;rashes.&quot; When both spots and rashes appear, it is difficult for young children to endure. However, neither should be purged. Generally, there are more medicines for calming and fewer for dispersing. If urination is constipated, slightly relieve it. If the body feels warm, treat it normally; if cool, treat it in reverse. It is paramount to avoid applying cold externally and using dispersive internal medications; without these two, one can be assured of safety.</p>
<p><strong>Sticky Sores with Yellow Fluid</strong></p>
<p>In the case of children&#39;s sticky sores with yellow fluid, this is due to accumulated wind-heat from the liver and spleen meridians. If the pathogen is on the surface causing pain and itching, if mild, use the rhinoceros horn disinfecting powder; if severe, use the lianqiao and fangfeng decoction. If the pathogen is internal leading to constipation, if mild, use the nine-flavored detox powder; if severe, use the great lianqiao drink. If there is head and eye discomfort, aversion to cold and strong heat, thirst, and constipation, then there is a pestilence inside and out; add a modified cooling drink. If fever and aversion to cold arise from taking purging medicines, it indicates lung qi injury; use the four gentlemen&#39;s formula, plus zhike and chaihu. For fever with vomiting indicating stomach qi damage, use the yigong powder. For fever with diarrhea indicating spleen qi deficiency, use the six gentlemen&#39;s decoction, plus chaihu and shengma. The rest should be adjusted according to the symptoms.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br><strong>Head and Face Sores</strong></p>
<p>The Yang energies of the human body converge at the head and accumulate on the face. When there are sores, it is due to disharmony among the internal organs, causing blood and Qi to stagnate in the Yang meridians. This may result from a deficiency of kidney Yin and liver fire, or from maternal toxicity during pregnancy, or from the six excesses and seven emotions experienced by the wet nurse, or from the consumption of rich food and strong alcohol, or from overindulgence in sweet and heavy food by the child. The causes differ, thus each condition must be assessed in terms of its meridians, examining the specific cause for treatment.</p>
<p>If the sores appear at the inner corners of the eyes, in front of the ears, on the upper cheeks near the nose, and at the inner corners of the eyes, these are linked to the small intestine meridian. If they occur on the crown of the head, at the lower cheeks, behind the ears, and on both sides of the brain, these belong to the gallbladder meridian. Sores in front of the cheeks near the nostrils, or on either side of the philtrum, relate to the large intestine meridian. Sores on the sides of the nose, beneath the lips, at the承浆 (Chengjiang), behind the ears, on the cheekbones, in front of the ears, and at the hairline on the forehead belong to the stomach meridian. Finally, sores at the inner corners of the eyes, on the forehead, and extending to the back of the head and neck are associated with the bladder meridian. After identifying the meridians, differentiated treatment should be applied.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>If there is excess kidney fire, use Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill; for fetal toxins, use Rhinoceros Horn Detoxification Pill; for food accumulation causing diarrhea, use Four Flavor Fat Baby Pill; for nursing mothers with rich food, use Dongyuan Stomach Clearing Powder. As for diseases affecting the various organs, they must also involve the internal organs; hence, if there is a condition in the forehead related to the heart channel with fever from drinking cold, it is real heat, use Daochi Powder; if fever from drinking soup, it is empty heat, use Nourishing Heart Decoction. The left cheek pertains to the liver channel; if there is stiffness in the neck, it is real heat, use Chaihu Clear Liver Powder; if there is teeth grinding and irritability, it is empty heat, use Six Flavor Rehmannia Pill. The right cheek concerns the lung channel; if there is coughing with drinking cold, it is real heat, use Xie Bai Powder; if there is fever and cough, it is fire harming metal, use Ginseng Lung Calming Powder. The nose corresponds to the stomach channel; if there is fever from drinking cold and yellow hard stool, it is real heat, use Xie Huang Powder; if there is fever from drinking soup and clear white stool, it is empty heat, use Yigong Powder. If there is a condition at the chin and ear rim, it pertains to the bladder channel; if the kidney is not in excess, use Rehmannia Pill. If the sore has already festered and not healed over time, one must carefully examine the interactions of the organ energies and the transmission of pathogenic factors, focusing on tonifying the spleen and stomach. If the illness is caused by heat left by the nursing mother, treat the mother first, and the child will naturally recover.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br><strong>Head Sores</strong></p>
<p>Head sores in children are caused by the six yang energies being attacked by toxic heat, leading to sores on the head. If the sores spread in patches, often causing dryness and itching, and there is sparse hair with a resemblance to white flakes, this is due to accumulated heat attacking upward, known as bald sores. Although the sores occur on the head, people only know to apply external medicine for healing. However, within a short month, the sores reappear. Why is this so? It is because the head is the meeting place of the yang energies. In the &quot;Hong Fan,&quot; the five elements state that fire rises, and when toxic heat attacks upward, the two yangs scorch each other, which is why sores develop on the head. The treatment should focus on resolving the accumulated heat of the Chen Gao and alleviating the restlessness of the heart channel; then, it can be effective. Additionally, use Fangfeng Tongsheng Powder mixed with wine, separately grind the Dahuang into a powder, then mix with wine to dry before grinding into a powder. Prepare a decoction using one qian and take four to five doses daily, expecting noticeable results after thirty applications.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br><strong>Facial Sores</strong></p>
<p>To treat facial sores in children, when the face is sore and the skin is entirely broken, with pus oozing out, apply aged lard or unsalted pig fat; it is remarkably effective.</p>
<p><strong>Eyebrow Sores</strong></p>
<p>Eyebrow sores refer to sores that develop between a child&#39;s eyebrows resembling scabies. One should seek the cause and treat it accordingly. The eyebrows relate to the gallbladder meridian; if there is inherent heat in the liver and gallbladder or if the wet nurse has heat in her liver and gallbladder, use a decoction of Bupleurum and Gardenia; if the wet nurse consumes rich food and strong alcohol, use a modified Clear Stomach Decoction; if the wet nurse is emotionally distressed, use a modified Xiao Yao San. Both the wet nurse and child should take this, with the child consuming a small amount, considering the previous symptoms. For treating eyebrow sores, apply Qingjin powder; if there is no improvement, burn wheat until charred, grind finely, and mix with good wine for application.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Pus</strong></p>
<p>According to Tang’s writings: There are five types of ear conditions, with constant yellow pus being referred to as &quot;ear fullness,&quot; red pus as &quot;ear pus,&quot; white pus as &quot;entangled ear,&quot; foul-smelling pus as &quot;five ears,&quot; and internal ringing with green pus as &quot;trembling ear.&quot; Although there are five types of symptoms, they all stem from the same source. They result from wind and water entering the ear, causing heat accumulation and obstruction. If not treated early, it may lead to deafness. It is recommended to use lipstick ointment for treatment, along with medications to clear phlegm and reduce heat, to achieve recovery.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>Mouth Ulcers</p>
<p>Mouth ulcers present differently in form and name, hence the treatment varies. They may arise before illness or occur after an illness has developed. Generally, this ailment does not depend on thinness or leanness; those with excess blood and qi, or those who have been too warm in their nourishment, may experience this. It can also be due to heat in the heart and spleen channels, or heat accumulating in the stomach, which heats and forces upwards to cause ulcers. This is a condition of excess, and treatments should focus on dispelling heat and extracting toxins to eliminate inflammation, resulting in natural recovery.</p>
<p>One may use Danggui powder with additions of Shengma, Gancao, Huangqin, Shengjiang, green onions, and prepared as a decoction; also consider Burdock root soup, Detoxifying drink, and Mutong powder, applied with nitrate yellow powder.</p>
<p>If the ulcers present as white sores on the tongue and there are external ulcers on the lips, characterized by few but large sores, with little pain and often fluid discharge, this is due to internal heat vaporizing from spleen deficiency. The internal ailment manifests externally, so it is advisable to use Baijiesan to disperse and release the exterior; Danggui powder with water, ginger, and jujube boiled together can harmonize the stomach qi and regulate internal heat. Following that, one may use Burdock root soup and Sanjiesan, applying it with Lüpao powder for immediate effect. Drinking Huangjin powder or using Tianzhuhuang powder or Dihuang paste can also help.</p>
<p>If the ulcer forms at the corners of the mouth, it indicates excessive heat in the spleen, causing dryness and pain upon opening the mouth, making eating and drinking difficult.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>If there is an external wind blowing, it may cause tearing and slight bleeding, known as Yanwen sore. The treatment is the same as previously mentioned herbal remedies; in mild cases, apply the steam from boiling liquid using a steamer cover, which is also effective. </p>
<p>If small red patches appear on the lips, this is due to greasy and unclean foods. Since infants have delicate and tender skin, exposure can lead to sores, especially with the invasion of wind-heat, called Chengjiang sore, also referred to as Gan Shi sore; the cause is the same. The treatment follows the same internal herbal remedies as previously mentioned.</p>
<p>If there is an unexplained bad breath with decay that does not form sores, or if cooling agents or powdered medicines do not heal it, this is named Yuan Jiao. Therefore, Shu He in &quot;Pulse Treatise&quot; states: when there is a frail heat in the spleen along with bad breath, this indicates that the spleen has empty heat rising to the mouth, so one should take the Hui Yang powder. For older children, use black tin pill before meals with slightly salted water mixed and swallow to restore the original qi, along with Shen Ling Bai Zhu powder and Tiao Yuan powder to achieve immediate effects; apply golden powder to the decayed areas, or mix honey with warm water, place it on the tongue to let it dissolve and swallow without harm. Avoid toxic substances.</p>
<p>Various types of Gan mouth sores are caused by improper nursing, or excessive heat accumulated by the mother&#39;s rich diet, or by the emotional stresses affecting the wet nurse.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>If the tongue, lips, teeth, and gums appear ulcerated, and if there is thirst for cold drinks with a red hue on the forehead, along with a rapid and strong pulse on the left wrist, this pertains to the heart meridian. First, use Dao Chi San to clear the heart fire, then follow up with Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water. If there are alternating chills and fever, with a bluish-red left cheek and a wiry and strong pulse on the left guan, this is associated with the liver meridian. First, use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San to clear liver fire, and then apply Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish liver blood. If both cheeks are yellow-red, there is decaying gums, foul-smelling stools, and a rapid pulse on the right guan that feels slack upon pressure, this belongs to the spleen meridian. Treat with Si Wei Fei Er Wan for spleen fire, and supplement spleen qi with Wu Wei Yi Gong San. If there is fever and cough, a red right cheek, and a rapid pulse on the right cun that feels rough upon pressure, this relates to the lung meridian. First, use Qing Fei Yin to treat lung fire, and then use Wu Wei Yi Gong San to supplement spleen and stomach. If there is fever and thirst, with dark coloration on both chins and a rapid left chi pulse, this indicates kidney deficiency. First, apply Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to generate kidney water, and then use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to generate lung qi. Additionally, for conditions like &quot;Zou Ma Gan,&quot; which arise from injury to spleen and stomach qi and blood due to illness, with deficiency fire rising, or from the residual toxins of pox and rash, treatments should be immediate with Tong Lu San and Da Wu Yi Tang. In mild cases, there may be decaying gums or swelling of the lips and cheeks; in severe cases, the gums may erode, exposing the teeth, and the cheeks may show signs of severe decay.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>If food and drink do not enter, and there is rapid, labored breathing with much phlegm, this indicates deficiency of the spleen and stomach, and failing of lung energy; if the cheeks and jaw are red and rotting with no pain, this indicates extreme deficiency of stomach energy resulting in flesh death, and cannot be treated. The classics say: the hand shaoyin channel connects to the tongue, and the foot taiyang channel connects to the mouth; thus, when there is heat in the heart and spleen channels, sores arise in the mouth and tongue. One should examine the facial features, differentiate between the channels&#39; fullness and emptiness, and prescribe accordingly. If vital energy is not depleted but there is an acute illness, with white flakes forming in the mouth or a heavy tongue, use chaotic hair wrapped around fingers dipped in well water to wipe it; or prick to release toxic blood and apply a willow flower powder. If there is swelling or blisters on the hard palate, one should prick and drain it, apply the front powder, or use indigo to rub on it. If it recurs after pricking, prick again. If the lips and mouth are cracked, apply a combination of angelica and willow flower powder.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>If the vital energy is deficient, or if one has taken cold and cooling medicines and experiences nausea and reduced appetite, this is a case of virtual heat. Use the Five-Flavored Different Functional Powder with added Sheng Ma and Chai Hu. If there is diarrhea and thirst, this indicates weak spleen and stomach; use the Seven-Flavored Bai Zhu Powder. If there is abdominal pain and aversion to cold, this suggests a cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach; use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with ginger and cinnamon. If caused by maternal consumption of alcohol and fried foods, use the Clear Stomach Powder. If caused by maternal overexertion in diet and labor, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; for liver and spleen blood deficiency, use the Enhanced Xiao Yao Powder; if there is internal heat due to pent-up anger, use the Enhanced Gui Pi Decoction, taken by both mother and child. Should there be mud-like symptoms indicating a need to reduce heat, it will inevitably transform into a sluggish spleen wind; still, assist by treating the tongue with methods to expel it. For oral ulcers that do not heal with cooling medicines, this indicates insufficient qi in the middle burner, with virtual fire surging upwards; it is advisable to use the Fu Zi Li Zhong Decoction.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br><strong>Mumps Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Mumps belongs to the Yangming stomach meridian. The occurrence of abscesses is often due to children consuming sweet, rich foods, leading to heat accumulation in the spleen and stomach. It can also result from a wet nurse&#39;s anger affecting the child. If the abscess is caused by internal heat and accompanied by difficulty in urination and defecation, use Qingge San. If a wind pathogen is present and urination is normal, use Loulu Tang. For wind-heat in the stomach meridian, or if there is also swelling and pain in the throat, use Shengma Fangfeng Tang. If there is a constitution with yin deficiency and fire, resulting in sores in the chin area or inside the ears, or persistent pus, use Dihuang Wan. If the wet nurse has liver fire affecting the spleen, use Jiawei Xiaoyao San; for heat stagnation in the spleen meridian, use Jiawei Guipi Tang; if there is heat from excessive rich foods, use Dongyuan Qingwei San. For wind-heat in the spleen and stomach, use Qingyan Lige Tang. Also consider treatment for oral sores.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br><strong>Arm Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The signs of an arm abscess should be differentiated by meridians and treated according to the causes underlying the condition. The upper section corresponds to the Hand Yangming meridian, the lower section to the Hand Taiyang meridian, the outer section to the Hand Shaoyang meridian, and the inner section to the Hand Jueyin meridian. The inner upper section corresponds to the Hand Taiyin meridian, and the inner lower section to the Hand Shaoyin meridian. If there is heat stagnation in the meridians, with external wind evils invading, leading to disruption of qi and blood, abscesses and toxins may arise. If there is heat in the Heart meridian, use Duozhisan with Huanglian. If there is heat in the Pericardium, use Chaihu and Zhizi powder. If there is heat in the Lung meridian, use Xiebai powder. If there is heat in the Large Intestine meridian, use Daliangqiao decoction. If there is swelling and pain, it indicates blood and qi stagnation; use Xianfang Huoming decoction. If the swelling and pain do not resolve, indicating the formation of pus, use Tori Xiaodu powder. If pus does not discharge, indicating deficiency of qi and blood, continue with Tori Xiaodu powder. If pus discharges but causes pain, indicating severe deficiency of qi and blood, and if muscles do not regenerate, indicating deficiency of Spleen and Stomach qi, use Wuwei Yigong powder. Do not apply external muscle-regenerating powder, as it may assist the evil and hinder muscle growth.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br><strong>Axillary Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Axillary abscess belongs to the pathways of the Foot Shao Yang, Hand Shao Yin, and Hand Jue Yin. In children, it is often caused by an inherent liver fire. At the initial stage, first use the Huoming Decoction, and then use the Chai Hu and Zhi Zi Powder. Within five to seven days, if pus forms and there is redness, swelling, and pain, continue to use the Huoming Decoction to diminish the major symptoms, making any rupture mild and easily manageable. If pus has already formed, use the Tuo Li Xiao Du Powder. Once it has come out, use the Tuo Li Powder. If symptoms change, treat according to the condition.</p>
<p><strong>Flank Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Flank abscess arises from the Foot Jue Yin and Shao Yang channels and is governed by the fire of the kidneys, which is the chief of wood. When the energies of the liver and gallbladder are unbalanced, the internal wind-fire collides, resulting in stagnation of blood and heat accumulation, leading to the formation of pus and swelling. It can also stem from an inherent heat of the liver and gallbladder caused by anger and rage. At the onset of redness, swelling, and pain, it is advisable to use the Chai Hu and Zhi Zi Powder; if it has not resolved, use the Xian Fang Huoming Decoction. If the heat has been diminished but the swelling has not subsided, pus must form, so then use the Tuo Li Xiao Du Powder. If pus has formed, it should be released with a substitutive ointment, while still using the Tuo Li Powder to aid healing. If pus is discharged and pain ceases, there is no need for medication.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>Abdominal Abscess</strong></p>
<p>An abdominal abscess occurs below the navel, usually about two inches from it, associated with the spleen channel; nearby the flank, it pertains to the gallbladder channel. It arises from deficiency of the spleen channel, leading to stagnation of qi and coagulation of blood, or due to spleen deficiency resulting from an accumulation of heat from food and drink. If there is swelling and pain, use the She Huang San (Yellow Powder). For hard, swollen, and painful areas, use the Qing Wei San (Clear the Stomach Powder). If swelling and pain are accompanied by constipation, use the Qing Liang Yin (Cooling Drink). If pain persists, it indicates blood stasis, and the Huo Ming Yin (Revive Life Drink) should be administered. If this medicine does not alleviate the condition, it suggests the formation of pus, for which you should use the Tuo Li Xiao Du San (Wash and Detoxify Powder). If pus is discharged but the pain does not diminish, it indicates that the toxin is not yet resolved; the previous medicine should also be continued. If pus is discharged but the pain increases and the pus is clear and thin, it indicates deficiency of qi and blood; use the Shen Qi Tuo Li San (Ginseng and Astragalus Wash and Detoxify Powder). If there is decreased appetite and fatigue, it indicates spleen qi deficiency; use the Wu Wei Yi Gong San (Five Flavor Beneficial Powder) with added Dang Gui (Angelica) and Chai Hu (Bupleurum). If there is a fever in the afternoon, it suggests spleen blood deficiency; use the Si Jun, Dang Gui, and Dan Pi (Four Gentlemen, Dang Gui, and Moutan). If other symptoms are present, treat according to those specific symptoms.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>Buttock Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Buttock abscess is attributed to damp-heat in the bladder meridian, or a yin deficiency constitution. If there is swelling and hardness with pain, use the internal formula Qianghuo Decoction; if there is slight swelling and mild pain, use the Tori Dispersing Detoxification Powder. If there is severe pain at the onset, or if it seems to neither resolve nor rupture within five days, first use the Xianfang Huoming Decoction, followed by the Tori Dispersing Detoxification Powder. If it has already ruptured, with poor appetite, fatigue, and non-healing sores, and if the spleen and stomach are weak, use the Wumei Yigong Powder with added Chaihu and Shengma. For those with a yin deficiency and frequent urination that does not restrain, use the modified Eight Flavor Pill. If there is qi deficiency and it has not healed for a long time, use the Douzhi Cake and the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction to nourish the vital energy. If using heat-clearing and toxin-purging or applying cold agents, the qi and blood will be harmed, and it will definitely lead to a failed outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Leg Abscess</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of leg abscess are associated with different meridians, and thus the treatment methods are also different. Abscesses arising on the inner side belong to the liver and spleen meridians; those on the outer side belong to the gallbladder and stomach meridians. If there is extensive swelling that is hard, it indicates a weakness of vital energy; use the internal formula Huangqi Decoction. If the swelling is intense, it indicates that the vital energy is not yet depleted; use the internal formula Chaihu Huangqi Decoction, combined with the external application of garlic poultice. If there is stagnant blood that does not resolve or form pus, use the Huoming Decoction. If the blood and qi are weak and unable to rupture, leading to non-healing of muscle tissue, use the Tori Powder. This summarizes the main points.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br><strong>Lung Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Lung abscess and lung emaciation arise from the weakness of spleen and lung qi, leading to loose pores that allow external pathogens to invade. It may also occur if the mother consumes spicy and rich foods, passing heat to the child; or if the child is ill and suffers excessive sweating that depletes body fluids, resulting in deficient fire damaging the lungs; or from the administration of harsh medications that impair the spleen and stomach, preventing them from nourishing the lung metal. The symptoms include aversion to wind, coughing, nasal congestion, stiff neck, difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, slight swelling of the limbs, along with coughing up purulent blood. If fetid and foul-smelling vomit occurs, accompanied by hidden pain in the chest and a rapid, strong pulse, it indicates a lung abscess. Coughing up phlegm and saliva with a rapid and weak pulse indicates lung emaciation. An aversion to cold and wheezing reveals an internal retention of cold pathogenic factors, treated with Xiao Qing Long Tang. Coughing up purulent foul matter indicates internal perforation of the lung, treated with Jie Geng Tang. I opine that if there are symptoms of wheezing with shortness of breath, it indicates weakness in spleen and lung qi, requiring Wu Wei Yi Gong San. Coughing up purulent phlegm with a rapid but weak left pulse indicates kidney qi deficiency, treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. Coughing up purulent phlegm with a rapid but weak right pulse suggests spleen qi deficiency, treated with Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. If there is fever, wheezing, and inability to eat while coughing up pus, it signifies severe deficiency of spleen and lung, which is difficult to treat. The primary approach is to tonify the spleen and lung, nourish kidney essence, and observe the interactions among the five organs while considering the emotions of the nursing mother. Follow similar principles for subsequent symptoms.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br><strong>Intestinal Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Zhongjing said: The symptoms of intestinal abscess arise from dietary heat accumulation, or from a mother’s consumption of spicy and hot foods. When pressing the lower abdomen, there is pain; urination is frequent and resembles dysuria; there is abdominal urgency and a dislike of cold; the skin feels tight, and there may be spontaneous sweating and aversion to cold. If the pulse is slow and tight and there is no pus present, use Xianfang Huoming Decoction to dispel the poison; if the pulse is surging and rapid and pus is present, take Taiyi Ointment to expel the pus. If there is abdominal pain and difficulty urinating, it indicates pus stagnation, which can be addressed by Mudanpi Powder. I secretly believe that the texts state: Intestinal abscess is a disease that should not cause alarm, for fright can lead to rupture of the intestines and death. Therefore, in sitting, lying, or turning, one must move slowly and gently, occasionally drink diluted porridge, and use Eight Treasure Soup to strengthen the vital energy, allowing for calm nurturing and regulation, which may help preserve health.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>Poison from the Bowels</strong></p>
<p>This poison arises from liver fire or liver damp-heat, or it may be due to heat toxin in the liver channel. If there is initial swelling, hardness, and pain, begin with one or two doses of Longdan Xiegan Decoction; if the swelling and pain do not diminish, use two doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction. If after five to seven days the swelling remains hard and does not reduce, also use each of the previous two medicines once. If it does not resolve or becomes more painful, indicating potential pus formation, use one dose of Huo Ming Decoction and then apply Tuoli Xiaodu San with added Chaihu and Sanzi for one or two doses. </p>
<p>If pus has formed but is not draining, it&#39;s due to blood and qi deficiency; use Tuoli Xiaodu San for one or two doses. If pus has drained but pain persists, it indicates unresolved toxins; administer one dose of Huo Ming Decoction. If pus has emerged but pain recurs, it suggests blood and qi deficiency; use Neibu Huangqi Decoction. For cases where pus has drained and there are symptoms of fever and agitation, indicating qi deficiency and blood loss, use Danggui Bubai Decoction. If pus has drained and there are chills with fever, indicating both blood and qi deficiency, use Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. </p>
<p>If there are chills after pus has drained, indicating yuan qi deficiency, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction. If there is no skin regeneration after the pus has drained, this points to spleen qi deficiency; use Liu Junzi Decoction. If the patient is constitutionally weak, or if they have become ill due to diet and overwork, simply administer Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with added Shegan for self-resolution. </p>
<p>Failing to differentiate between channels, neglecting the distinctions of deficiency and excess, and broadly attacking may deplete qi and blood; thus, mild cases become hard to treat, while severe cases may develop into chronic conditions, risking significant complications.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br><strong>Abscess of the Sac</strong></p>
<p>The abscess of the sac is attributed to damp-heat in the liver channel or is caused by inherited liver heat. When it first appears with swelling and pain and bloody urine, it indicates damp-heat obstruction; initially, use Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction. If there is no improvement, use Xian Fang Huo Ming Decoction. If the swelling and pain persist for several days and there is a desire for it to rupture, use Tuo Li Xiao Du San. If the swelling has not yet ruptured and urinary passage is obstructed, this indicates toxic qi stagnation, and one should promote urination. If pus has formed but urination remains obstructed, this indicates that the toxic qi has not been resolved; one should use a needle to relieve it. If pus exits and pain returns, this is due to deficiency of qi and blood, and one should tonify. If the source qi is not deficient, even if the scrotum ruptures and the testicles are exposed, it is not harmful. If a nursing mother is angry and causes her child to suffer from this, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San; if there is deficiency of qi and blood in the liver channel, use Ba Zhen San, Jia Wei Chai Hu, and Shan Zhi, and add Lou Lu, for both mother and child to take.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>Frostbite on the toes occurs due to a deficiency of vitality and an inability to withstand cold, making it easy for cold pathogens to invade. When the qi and blood stagnate for a long time without healing, it can lead to ulceration and the formation of sores. The treatment must focus on strengthening the spleen and stomach and warming the qi and blood, allowing necrotic tissue to slough off and healthy flesh to regenerate. If there is detachment of bone and tendon, it should be urgently excised; otherwise, toxic secretions could lead to death. Indeed, at the extremities, qi and blood find it difficult to reach, and when obstructed by external pathogens, the flow of qi and blood becomes stagnant. If treated with hot water, it leads to internal death and loss of sensation; by spring, it will surely ulcerate, rot, and fall off. If the vital energy is not depleted, even if ill, there is no harm. However, if cold medications are applied externally and detoxifying agents are ingested, the vital energy may be harmed, leading to failure to heal. In cases of initial frostbite, frequent warm hand compresses are effective. In the north, if one mistakenly touches their frostbitten ear, it may fall off. Extreme cold can indeed crack the skin and cause fingers to fall off, which is true!</p>
<p>For burns and scalds, if there is fever and thirst along with red and painful urination, it indicates internal heat; use Si Wu Decoction with added Gardenia fruit, Forsythia, and Licorice. If there is pain but the flesh is not necrotic, it indicates heat toxin; apply Si Jun Zi Decoction with added Chuanxiong, Gardenia fruit, and Forsythia. If the flesh is dead but not ulcerating, there is qi and blood deficiency; use Si Jun Zi Decoction with added Angelica and Astragalus, and apply Angelica ointment externally or a mixture of cypress leaf powder and wax oil. If due to smoke it is at risk of death, irrigate with juice from fresh radish, and it will revive. If one suffers burns or scalds post-meal, resulting in fever, abdominal distension, aversion to food, and spasms, one should seek treatment for food accumulation and convulsions.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Flipping Flower Sores</strong></p>
<p>The condition of flipping flower sores arises after ulcers rupture, when wind and cold invade the affected area, or when liver fire and blood dryness generate wind, or when the milk mother&#39;s liver fire generates wind. This will inevitably lead to the ulcer edges becoming protruding like meat, resembling mushrooms, varying in size from that of a finger and differing in length. </p>
<p>If the wind evil persists, first use the Qi-preserving and Energy-reinforcing Decoction, adding Fangfeng and Tianma. If wind and cold are stagnant, first use the Shixuan Powder, adding Qianghuo and Tianma. If the child&#39;s liver fire generates wind, first use the Modified Xiaoyao Powder, adding Tianma and Qianghuo. If the mother&#39;s liver fire generates wind, first use the Modified Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, followed by the Modified Xiaoyao Powder with Luoluo and Tianma.</p>
<p>For wind evil lurking, apply a bean curd paste externally; for wind and cold stagnation, use the scallion compress method externally. Use Taiyi Ointment to protect the ulcer&#39;s opening; if the protruding meat does not diminish, apply Li Lu Ointment. If the ulcer edges do not close and there is chilling with fever, this indicates a deficiency of vital energy; use the Qi-preserving and Energy-reinforcing Decoction. </p>
<p>If there is evening heat and internal heat, indicating both Qi and blood deficiency, use the Eight Treasures Decoction, with double the amount of Ginseng and Astragalus. If appetite is poor and digestion difficult, indicating spleen Qi deficiency, use the Five Flavors Expelling Evil Powder. </p>
<p>If there is little appetite and thinking about food, irregular bowel movements, or if the muscles are emaciated and urine is clear, this suggests a combined liver and spleen deficiency; use the Nine Flavor Aloe Pills to clear liver fire and the Five Flavors Expelling Evil Powder to tonify spleen Qi, continuing the external treatment methods.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br><strong>Multiple Bone Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>Multiple bone ulcer arises from long-standing sores, depleting the spleen and stomach, causing blood and qi to fail to nourish the affected area. Evil qi invades; over time, tendons rot and bones decay, resulting in bones protruding, which is not due to congenital factors. One should nourish the spleen and stomach, strengthen vital qi, using internal remedies such as Dabu soup and Dihuang pills, and for external treatment, apply aconite cakes and onion poultices to dispel cold evil and replenish vital qi, leading to spontaneous separation of the bone and healing of the ulcer. If one uses harsh and destructive remedies, it can further harm the true qi and is rarely without danger. In infants suffering from this condition, one must adjust and supplement the nursing mother&#39;s diet and use external onion poultices to gradually alleviate the issue, particularly avoiding any aggressive corrosive drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of ulcers stem from insufficient innate qi and blood, or prolonged illness resulting in weak qi and blood, or from a child&#39;s liver and spleen being burdened by internal heat from food accumulation, which fails to produce muscle. Additionally, if the nursing mother experiences emotional imbalance, it further complicates the condition. If the spleen qi cannot consolidate, one must carefully assess the underlying causes, restore vital qi, and apply supportive remedies like Shengbing and onion poultices. Using draining and corrosive medicines, however, would only worsen the condition. I shall consult various experts on this matter.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br><strong>Leolu Decoction</strong><br>Used for treating children with heat toxins, boils, rashes, and various skin eruptions.<br>Ingredients: Leolu, Lianqiao, Baiwei, Bailian, Mangxiao (each 6 zhu), Dahuang (1 liang), Shengma, Zhishi, Mahuang, Huangqin (each 9 zhu).<br>Prepare these ten ingredients by grinding them, then add 1.5 sheng of water and boil to extract 5 he.

<p>The Toad Su Pill is renowned for its efficacy, combining ingredients such as milk, myrrh, alum, and light powder, with components like green vitriol, toad venom, cold water musk, snail, and centipede for its utility. It treats abscesses, boils on the back, brain ulcers, breast pus, and bone-related swellings, as well as various serious ailments and foul sores, whether they are painless or numb, or accompanied by vomiting. In severe cases, it can lead to stupor; but this medicine, when taken, will trigger dormant issues, alleviate pain, restore consciousness, relieve vomiting, eliminate unformed conditions, and dissolve mature ones, demonstrating true life-saving abilities—it is an invaluable elixir among grave illnesses.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Two qian of toad venom, dissolved in wine; five fen of light powder; one qian each of dry alum, calcined cold water stone, green vitriol, myrrh, frankincense, orpiment, and musk; two qian of realgar; twenty-one snails; and two qian of cinnabar. All should be finely ground and measured accurately. On the noon of the Dragon Boat Festival, in a clean room, first crush the snails, then mix with the toad venom to form a thick paste. Subsequently, add all other ingredients and thoroughly crush them together until uniform, shaping into pills the size of a broad bean. The dosage is three pills, taken with five inches of green onion, which the patient should chew thoroughly and spit out in the center of their left hand (for males) or right hand (for females), wrapping the medicine inside. Wash down with hot, ash-free wine in a teacup, and walk five to six miles to induce sweating for effect; if symptoms are serious, a second dose may be taken. During the administration period, women and animals should not be present.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>Taiyi Purple Gold Elixir</p>
<p>The Taiyi Purple Gold Elixir is made with major ingredients including the large dandelion, Cyperus tuber, and the clam, together weighing a thousand gold. The male musk and vermilion weigh a total of seven parts, with various ailments and symptoms all responding to this divine remedy. It resolves all poisons, heals various wounds, benefits passageways, and effectively treats countless diseases. This medicine genuinely has the ability to bring the dead back to life, and its formulation offers remarkable effects for helping others, which cannot be fully described. It is indispensable for those who enter and exit households, engage in major constructions, or mobilize large armies, as well as for officials from Fujian, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>To prepare, the mountain dandelion is cleaned of its skin and hair, then dried thoroughly, two taels. Five-fold gall, two taels. The musk is ground finely, three qian. The white seeds of the continued-wort, with oil removed, are cleaned, one tael. The red bud of the large dandelion from Hangzhou is considered superior; the local large dandelion from Jiangnan is second, while the northern cotton dandelion, which is white in color, is too potent and can harm the正气 (vital energy), causing those who are weak to vomit blood—this is not suitable for use. Only the superior form is chosen, with the root removed and thoroughly cleaned and dried into a powder, one tael and five qian. Vermilion that is lively and bright red in large chunks must be ground finely, three qian each for the above medicines, selecting the best quality in a clean space for preparation. </p>
<p>Wait for auspicious dates such as the Dragon Boat Festival, Qixi Festival, Chongyang Festival, or on days with celestial merit or the celestial physician, and ensure that any person entering the room for the preparation has fasted and bathed three days prior, changing into clean, new clothing and hats. On the appointed day, they should enter the room with clean hands, incense burning, and set up a spirit tablet for the medicine. The host leads others in burning incense and praying. Once completed, each of the seven ingredients is measured and placed into a large mortar, ground for hundreds of turns, then placed into a fine stone mortar, gradually adding glutinous rice and thick liquid to mix, balancing soft and hard until the mixture is pounded over a thousand times, until achieving a polished finish.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br>For each pill, take one coin’s worth. For those with more severe conditions, take two pills continuously to achieve thorough benefits, and afterwards, replenish with warm porridge. During the preparation, aside from those who are clean and diligent, others should not be present. This medicine only works in an environment of sincerity and cleanliness. It treats all sorts of dietary poisons, toxins, epidemic miasmas, harmful bacteria, pufferfish poisoning, as well as the meat of carrion from dead cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep; consumption of this can lead to confusion and immediate collapse, or strange symptoms may appear. Administer it through water grinding, resulting in either vomiting or diarrhea, and the person will surely recover. The miasma from southern hills, smoky epidemics, is particularly harmful. Upon feeling discomfort, cold or hot, with nausea that does not relieve, grinding and taking one pill will help induce vomiting and restore balance. It can also treat boils, abscesses, mouth sores, unnamed swellings, red-threaded rot, and conditions like bayberry sores, various wind rashes, longstanding hemorrhoids, by grinding it with clear, low-ash wine for internal use, and applying with water for external use on the sores, repeatedly throughout the day and night until itching diminishes and healing occurs.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br>Yin and Yang toxins, cold damage with a heavy heart, wild words and chaotic speech, chest and diaphragm stagnation, evil toxins still present, pestilence causing agitation and madness, throat constriction and wind in the throat—all should be treated with mint tea, ground and taken when cool. For dysentery, both red and white, abdominal diarrhea, urgent pain from cholera, cramping and sand-like pain in the intestines, and phlegm-related wheezing, use ginger tea, ground and taken. For men and women in acute distress with inverted conditions, shouting and rushing, ghostly interferences, ghostly energy and nightmares, losing one&#39;s mind in chaos, capitulations like a lamb or pig&#39;s convulsions, use a decoction of Acorus tatarinowii, ground and taken. For strokes and loss of vital energy, facial drooping, clenched jaws, speech difficulties, muscle and tendon contractions, joint wind and swelling, widespread pain, difficulty walking, and all kinds of wind and seizures, use warm wine, ground and taken quickly. For those who die by hanging, drowning, fright, nightmares, or ghostly confusion, if the heart is only slightly warm and not yet cold, use fresh ginger and wine for mending, ground and taken. For injuries from all kinds of venomous snakes, wind hounds, scorpions, and other vile creatures causing swelling and flooding the body—with severe cases of toxic gas causing confusion and cries for help—immediate use of wine is advised, followed by green onion eaten and covered to induce sweating and recovery. For new or recurring malaria, at the onset prepare a decoction of peach and willow branches for grounding and taking.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br>For children suffering from acute or chronic convulsions, five types of sores and dysentery, spleen disease with yellow swelling, rashes, and tumors, and when teeth are clenched, use peppermint soaked in water, ground to a paste, mixed with honey, and take it. Apply it to the swelling as well. For young children, divide a dose into several parts. For toothache, grind it and apply it to the painful area, and hold a little in the mouth for a while before swallowing. If an infant shows signs of inherited toxins, with skin peeling and spots within a hundred days of birth, or if the mouth or eyes are damaged, use clear water to grind and apply. For injuries from falls, use turpentine mixed with ashless wine to take. Those suffering from prolonged headaches or discomfort at the temples due to lingering toxicity after a rash should take a ground dose and apply it to the temples. For women with menstrual blockages, use safflower soup. In the case of widespread infectious diseases, where an epidemic has spread through streets and alleys, use peach root soup, ground to a paste, and rub it into the nostrils, also taking a small amount to ensure it reaches the sick without spreading further. This also treats wasting diseases when other medicines fail. A certain healer recommended it; take one dose every morning, and after three doses, expel harmful substances and irregular forms from the body, thus achieving relief and restoring health—countless lives have been saved this way. One woman, suffering for a long time from a wasting disease caused by parasitic worms, took a dose, and shortly afterward expelled over ten small worms. Following this, she took a soothing pill and swiftly recovered after a month of proper care. Truly, it is a precious medicine for healing and preserving life!<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br>Cool the diaphragm powder contains: Schizonepeta, Mint, Tangerine Peel, Rhubarb, Lizard Tail, Gypsum, Scrophularia, and Burdock Seed.

<p>Note: The above formula may deplete the middle qi and harm yin blood. If the patient is robust, with strong spleen and stomach, it may be used cautiously. However, children, due to their tender and delicate constitution, may not withstand this. As the classics say: &quot;Qi governs the expulsion, blood governs nourishment.&quot; Qi is the fundamental energy that harmonizes the stomach. If the stomach qi is compromised, it cannot dispel or dissipate. If pus has formed, it may not rupture; if it has ruptured, it may not regenerate flesh or converge. Therefore, it is hard to treat and may even lead to serious consequences, so caution is essential!<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br>Tori Disinfectant Powder treats weakness of the stomach pathway, which may be due to injury or depletion, leading to sores that cannot heal properly.

The Inner Canon states: If swelling comes first and then pain, this is caused by an injury to qi; if pain comes first and then swelling, this is due to an injury to the body. It also states: Disharmony among the five organs leads to obstruction of the nine orifices, and disharmony in the six directions leads to the formation of abscesses. The Essentials of Surgery states that sores that are high and soft arise from the blood vessels; swelling that is low and hard arises from the sinews; if the flesh color does not change, it arises from the bone marrow.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>There must be an internal aspect that manifests externally; hence, the sutras concerning what is experienced and the location of affliction are distinct, making it improper to universally apply external cooling medicines. Only when the spleen and stomach are intact, and blood and qi are harmonious, might they be effective. If one takes detoxifying medicines that injure the spleen and stomach, causing stagnation of blood and qi, they cannot dispel toxins. For conditions like abscesses, the intent is to expel the poison; however, if previous medicines are used again, cold will damage the muscles, and blood and qi will stagnate, leading to internal poison that is beyond remedy. The treatment must carefully consider the height and extent of swelling, color (whether red or white), the severity of pain, the ease or difficulty of pus formation, the thickness of pus output, and the speed of new tissue growth to determine its nature as yin or yang, or a mix of both. Appropriate medicines should be used to cool, heat, or harmonize as needed. One should also examine the transmission of symptoms and the interactions of the five organs, with a focus on nourishing the spleen and stomach to avoid worsening the condition.</p>

<p>Used to treat sores from burns and scalds, regardless of whether they have broken or not.

Apply until the flesh gradually turns white, indicating the poison has dissipated, and it promotes muscle regrowth swiftly. This ointment consists of Angelica Sinensis, raw Rehmannia, sesame oil, and beeswax, all known for promoting flesh regrowth, relieving pain, nourishing blood, and replenishing sinews, and is especially suitable for new flesh.</p>

<p>Acupuncture and Moxibustion</p>
<p>Wan&#39;s &quot;Jade Heart Book&quot; states: For all swellings and toxins in children, the leech needle method is to be used. Take five or six large leeches, place them on the swollen area to suck out the bad blood, which can cure red lumps and drain abscesses. Wang Kentang&#39;s &quot;Standards of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: For treating red dan毒 (toxic heat), which moves unpredictably, gather the blood in one spot, use a fine porcelain vessel to crush, take the sharp edges, split apart with chopstick ends, and tie with thread. Pinch lightly with two fingers on the chopsticks, allowing the sharp edge to focus on the blood gathering area; then use another chopstick to strike repeatedly, piercing out the toxic blood. If it is mild, let it be sucked out by mouth and apply medicine. If the condition is on the head, do not use the stone therapy; instead, use needles to lift and stimulate the affected area to draw out the toxic blood; delay can lead to the toxic blood entering the abdomen, making it difficult to expel. If the toxicity increases after stone therapy, use Shen Gong San (Divine Efficacy Powder); if mild, avoid using stone therapy afterward to prevent pain from the broken skin. For treating flowing sores and abscesses, as well as &quot;crane knee wind&quot; and similar conditions, perform moxibustion two to thirty times daily; for painful conditions, heat until the pain subsides, and for non-painful areas, continue until pain is elicited, allowing the toxin to disperse with the heat.<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br>To address the obstruction caused by fire and to dispel toxic elements, this method is essential in treatment and has the power of revival. The procedure involves taking garlic, peeling it, and slicing it into coins about three-fingers thick. Place it on the affected area and apply moxa on top of the garlic to perform three moxa treatments. Replace the garlic and continue the moxibustion; if the condition is not yet resolved, it will dissipate, and even if already developed, it will still eliminate the poison. For larger sores, mash garlic and spread it over the affected area, then apply moxa on top and burn it, replacing the garlic as needed. If there is no pain, or if pus forms, or if it does not develop, particularly for sores associated with Yin conditions, moxibustion should be performed frequently. In general, sores that do not hurt, do not produce pus, or do not develop are indicative of Qi and blood deficiency, and these should typically not be treated. However, for issues on the head and face, extensive moxibustion is not advisable. </p>
<p>For treating conditions like stream and tubercular swelling, bone abscesses, and conditions like &quot;crane knee,&quot; begin with indirect moxibustion over garlic. If residual swelling persists, apply this to aid Qi, promote blood flow, and dissipate the stagnation, yielding swift results. This method is also excellent for treating injuries from falls, relieving pain, dispersing blood, and reducing swelling. The procedure involves finely chopping and mashing green onions, frying them until cooked, and frequently applying them to the affected area, replacing them once cool. For &quot;crane knee wind,&quot; it is effective when combined with Da Fengfeng Decoction for recovery.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br><strong>Pediatric Ulcer Cases</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Records</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Ge Zhi Yu Lun&quot; states: A two-year-old child, the second son of a Jinshi from Dongyang, had sores all over his head. One day the sores unexpectedly healed, and he then suffered from phlegm and wheezing. Upon examining him, I said: &quot;This is due to maternal toxin, so be cautious not to administer purgative medicine.&quot; Everyone was stunned. I further asked: &quot;What did the mother crave during her pregnancy?&quot; Zhang replied: &quot;Spicy and hot foods were what she liked.&quot; I then prescribed a formula consisting of ginseng, forsythia, angelica, licorice, dried tangerine peel, peony, and hemp plant, boiled into a concentrated decoction, mixed with bamboo juice and given to him. After several days, he became stable. Someone asked: &quot;How did you know this?&quot; I replied: &quot;I noticed his spirit was dull and tired, the illness was deep-seated, and there was no external pathogen; what else could it be but maternal toxin?&quot;</p>
<p>My second daughter, lean and quick-tempered, had a constitution with heat. In her third month of pregnancy, during the peak of summer heat, she felt parched, craved water, and occasionally had mild fevers. I instructed her to take the Four Substances Decoction with added scutellaria, dried tangerine peel, licorice, and hemp plant. Due to her laziness in cooking, she stopped after a few doses. Later, this child, at the age of two, developed sores all over his body, which suddenly healed one day, and a few days later he developed mumps. I stated: &quot;This is maternal toxin. If the sores arise again, the disease can self-resolve.&quot; And indeed, it happened just as I said. If during her pregnancy she had strictly followed the prescribed formula, she would not have been ill!</p>
<p>Tang Shi said: The daughter of General Zhang San, aged fifteen, suffered from measles. Many physicians tried numerous remedies but were unsuccessful. She called me to see her, and with fresh Four Substances Decoction plus fangfeng and scutellaria, she recovered within a day.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br>The text from &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: A small child from the Huang family had a swollen, red face and could not open his eyes. A practitioner lightly pricked him with a (golden needle), removing the sharp points from his eyes and performing dozens of needle pricks that led to bleeding three times, after which he recovered. Many practitioners are unwilling to follow this method; they insist on treating illnesses without careful protection.</p>
<p>According to Wan&#39;s &quot;Young Child Explanation,&quot; a small child had a red rash on his face, with swollen eyes, and could not be approached. He died after three days.</p>
<p>A small child had numerous boils on his head, experiencing chills and pain during summer, with symptoms fully manifesting. First, a dose of Ren Shen Bai Du San, augmented with Huang Lian and Xiang Ru was given, which immediately relieved the pain; next, Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin was administered. Within three doses, the larger boils purged pus, while the smaller ones resolved on their own. After consuming rich food again, symptoms recurred, which required Qing Wei San and Huo Ming Yin to be taken once each to cure him.</p>
<p>A small child had swelling and pain in his head and face, which was attributed to heat toxin in the stomach channel. Initially, Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin was used, followed by Qing Wei San, leading to recovery. Later, ulcers appeared on the tongue, requiring topical application of powdered medicine, and he experienced severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and lack of appetite, with cold extremities. I diagnosed it as spleen and stomach deficiency with cold, treated with Yi Gong San augmented with Sheng Ma, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A small child, over ten days old, had a sizeable poisonous sore on his head with a red halo, and the situation was critical. During treatment, black blood was drawn with a guillotine needle, causing the child to feel secure. The following day, he developed a similar condition between his eyebrows, which also exhibited a red halo. I believed immediate treatment with the needle was necessary, but the consensus was to wait until the second day for treatment. Ultimately, the blood clotted and could not be drawn, leading to abdominal bloating and death.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a><br>A young child suffered from heat毒 (toxic heat) on the face, and after taking medicine to clear the stomach, the swelling and pain worsened. I thought the toxic energy was excessive and the blood stagnation had not subsided, so I used the Immortal Life Restoring Drink twice, and the child recovered. Later, due to food injury, experiencing morning chills and evening heat, the face again suffered this ailment. After taking fire-reducing medicine, the mouth and tongue became red and swollen, and the hands and feet were cold. I believed the stomach energy was again damaged and turned to cold, so I used the Five Flavor Distinctive Powder and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another child was born with a body covered in itchy rashes and enjoyed being rubbed and patted. I prepared a prescription: using black snake wine, soak and roast to obtain one qian (about three grams) of meat; soak and roast two qian of bitter onion wine; stir-fried sesame seeds and stir-fried white thistle, each one qian and five fen (about five grams total). I combined these into a powder, mixed the soaked snake and bitter onion wine into a paste to form pills, and administered them with licorice soup, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A five-year-old boy developed pus-filled blisters all over his body every spring, which was a fetal toxin. I advised avoiding topical medicines, fearing that powdered arsenic and sulfur toxins could enter the belly through weaknesses. Instead, I treated him with sesame seed pills and he recovered. Additionally, I applied moxibustion to Fengchi, Xuechi, Quuchi, and Sanli points, and thereafter, he never had a recurrence.</p>
<p>The daughter of the Wang family, aged four, had a lump behind her ear. When asked, I stated: it is not a sore but a phlegm nodule. There is no need for treatment, as it is not harmful. Under the misguidance of another doctor, she was treated as if it were a sore, taking excessive medicine made from the prickly pear inside, which harmed her spleen and stomach, leading to illness and death—how tragic! Another child developed swollen, hard, and painful lumps near the front of the ear, commonly known as mumps. I applied the Detoxifying Powder, and it was remarkably effective.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a><br>A child suffered from sores in the mouth, and the doctor applied various medicines such as ge gen, lian, zhi, and bo, but to no avail. I said it was caused by heat in the heart, and the bitter herbs would only aggravate that heat; hence it was ineffective. I then created a &quot;washing heart powder&quot; for them, which provided relief after one dose.</p>
<p>My nephew had sores all over his mouth, throat, lips, and tongue, prompting me to prescribe medicine. I formulated a prescription using three grams each of bo he and lian, five grams of red mercury and white alum, and three grams of dried pillbug, grinding it finely; it worked immediately, which was remarkable.</p>
<p>The &quot;Family Compilation on Smallpox&quot; by the Wan family states: After a small child&#39;s smallpox scabs fall off, the scars appear white. Someone asked me about this, and I said it indicates qi deficiency. The lungs, being the master of qi, are associated with the color white, so one should use ginseng and astragalus for a strong nourishing formula, or else there could be complications. The person responded, &quot;The smallpox has already cleared up, how could there be complications?&quot; One month later, the child suffered from severe wheezing and died.</p>
<p>The county magistrate&#39;s grandson developed smallpox. After the scabs fell off for over a month, the scars remained swollen, and now they began to discharge. Any toxic condition emerging from within is auspicious; I suggested a mixture of angelica stem, red peony, fang feng, jing jie, lian qiao, burdock seed, black ginseng, cicada shell, and sbeng ma, blended into a powder and infused with a decoction of bamboo leaves to adjust and take for relief.</p>
<p>A child had the scabs fall off, but the scars became swollen and itchy. I was consulted, and I said this was due to wind-heat. I prescribed the ginseng antidote powder added with fang feng and jing jie, and the child felt better after one dose. For others who experienced the same, using the jing jie antidote powder combined with ginseng and bathing in willow broth was effective as well.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a><br>A young child, after losing scabs, had uneven scars. When asked, I said: The family of smallpox advises against eating ginger, for fear that the marks will not be even. When inquired, it was indeed the case.</p>
<p>A young child after losing scabs developed swelling that turned into sores, which did not heal for a long time. They asked me to treat it, and I said: This is a pox toxin sore, caused by the child having picked at it, preventing it from falling off naturally, thus injuring the flesh and causing sores to reappear. I prescribed bitter herb pills, and it healed.</p>
<p>In Qishui, after the summer, a child of Nan Changzi developed boils after smallpox; they asked me to check. I saw their complexion was dark, looking tired and weak, and they had little appetite. I said: The child’s smallpox has not matured properly; the scabs were removed too soon. Now the boils are erupting, indicating a deficiency returning to the kidney, likely unable to produce pus and may lead to death. It turned out to be true.</p>
<p>Another young child developed boils after smallpox and urgently asked for treatment. I used the Ten Complete Great Nourishing Decoction, adding forsythia and honeysuckle, and treated it to recovery. Since the boils had already burst, this formula was used. Those who had burst boils have all been treated successfully with this.</p>
<p>A young child after smallpox developed boils and immediately asked for treatment. I used a detoxifying internal dispersing powder to adjust and they recovered.</p>
<p>A young child after smallpox developed a fever, and had difficulty with urination and defecation, with red scars. Other doctors said it was due to deficiency, wanting to use the Baoyuan Decoction. I said: No, this is actual heat! It was caused by eating spicy and hot foods. Indeed, after eating chicken, they suffered, but recovered after drinking a forsythia infusion.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a><br>The local magistrate, Lord Tang Xiaofeng, was twelve years old when he contracted smallpox in the first month of the Wuchen year. At that time, Tang asked me to enter the capital with him, so I invited my fourth son, Bangzhi, and my eighth son, Bangjing, to assist Han Fengqi in treating the pockmarks. Later, a red swelling appeared on his right shoulder, which was not an abscess. Han pricked it with a needle, but he could not lift his hand. At the end of March, Xiaofeng returned north and, upon reaching Shangcai, was greatly worried. I reassured him, saying, &quot;Do not worry!&quot; Upon examining him, I found that his hand was not painful but weak and powerless; he could not lift it by himself and had to use his left hand to do so. When Tang asked the reason, I said, &quot;It is due to liver heat and Qi deficiency.&quot; The liver governs the tendons, providing blood for nourishment; in cold, it contracts, and in heat, it expands. Only by replenishing Qi and nourishing blood will the illness resolve. So, I prepared a formula using ginseng, astragalus, angelica, ligusticum, white peony root, teasel root, licorice, white atractylodes, balloon flower, cardamom, coix seed, and mifang to make into pills, which he took for half a month and recovered.</p>
<p>A small child, after bathing, experienced swelling all over his face and body and asked me to treat him. I replied, &quot;This is due to water Qi.&quot; I used the Si Junzi Decoction to strengthen the spleen and remove dampness, added astragalus to bolster the exterior, and used saposhnikovia to counteract the dampness at the muscle surface and ephedra to expel the water from under the skin. After one dose, the swelling reduced. Later, I used the Qian family&#39;s Yigong Powder with additional polyporus and alisma to adjust and he recovered.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Overview&quot; states: Wu Yang, the son of Qiu Tianxiang, fell ill with chills and fever. Various physicians treated him for bone steaming fatigue, but his condition worsened over six months. A physician named Dai examined him and found that his pulse was strong and directed towards theuan (an acupoint), while the pulse at the same location was notably large. Dai stated, &quot;This is lung abscess.&quot; When he asked the boy&#39;s wet nurse if there had been any painful areas, she replied, &quot;No.&quot; Dai instructed the boy to remove his clothing and raised both of his arms, observing that the right side of his ribcage was slightly elevated. When Dai pressed on it, the boy moved to avoid the pressure, but did not react to pressure on the left rib. Dai concluded, &quot;There is an abscess in the lung, and it has already discharged pus.&quot; After treatment, the boy recovered.</p>
<p>One day, Li Shuhe asked Dong Yuan: &quot;In middle age, I had a son who developed red silk tumors after turning one year old, which were not treated. Subsequently, three or four more sons, before reaching two years old, all suffered from tumors and died. May I ask why this is?&quot; Dong Yuan replied, &quot;Let me ponder over it.&quot; The next day, he met with Shuhe and said, &quot;I have figured it out. There is concealed fire in your kidneys, and your essence contains much red silk, which is transmitted through qi, resulting in this ailment in your offspring. When disturbed, it manifests in the muscles, commonly referred to as fetal tumors.&quot; Shuhe examined this and found it was indeed as Dong Yuan described. He then took several doses of Kidney Nourishing Pill to expel the fire evil from his kidneys and to replenish the deficiency of the Heavenly True essence, while avoiding wine, meat, and pungent hot foods. His wife used Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to nourish her yin blood. After five months of pregnancy, she took a decoction made from Atractylodes and Scutellaria. Eventually, they had a son who, by the age of three, did not exhibit the previous symptoms again. Shuhe remarked, &quot;You are indeed a divine physician!&quot; and subsequently studied under him. Now, his son has grown strong.<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br>The &quot;Xue Family Medical Cases&quot; states: In the first month of the year of Bing Shen, a patient named Shichang had a red and swollen scrotum. I treated it as maternal toxicity and he recovered. Later, he suffered from fever and phlegm heat symptoms. Upon diagnosing his mother, I found stagnant fire and blood heat. I prescribed herbs to soothe the liver and cool the blood, and both mother and child recovered. By the beginning of June, he had vomiting and diarrhea, with reddish urine and twitching eyes. Treatments like ginseng and atractylodes did not respond. Some believed it to be chronic fright. I observed the pulse at the wrists and found it red, indicating wind-heat. A prescription of Chai Hu Qing Gan San with additions of Uncaria and Equisetum was given, and he was cured. In the first month of the year of Ding You, he developed a hot toxic sore on his neck that oozed pus. He caught wind and developed a fever, and his head and face swelled like a melon. Urgently, I needed to perform bloodletting, releasing about three cups of dark blood. I then used a detoxifying herbal decoction, resulting in the swelling subsiding significantly. The following day, I performed bloodletting again in various areas; the blood was less black, and I continued with the previous formula, adding cooked rehmannia, and he recovered. If the bloodletting had been done slowly, blood would have stagnated, potentially leading to tetanus and death.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a><br>A young child suffered from an external ailment that seemed mild, but internally experienced pain and blockage. This condition was located in the organs. They took a decoction of Forsythia and applied Shen Gong San, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child had issues with the buttocks, characterized by red swelling. This prompted frequent sucking, which caused the poison to accumulate in one place. Thus, black blood was drawn out, and an application of enhanced Shen Gong San was made. They used honeysuckle and licorice as powder, mixed with human milk for ingestion, and the child recovered. After more than a month, both legs were still swollen and treated as before, leading to healing. A few days later, the legs turned red again. They attempted to use rhinoceros horn to detoxify. The child had no appetite, and the abdomen was distended, once again harming the spleen and stomach. They continued applying the previous medication and took a restorative decoction with added Poria, resulting in recovery. Shen Gong San was effective but caused slight pain at the needled area; using Tai Yi Dan also helped.</p>
<p>A young child suffered in the leg, appearing as usual, eating normally. The poison was manifesting on the surface of the skin. I suggested needling to release the poison without the need for medicinal intake. However, they were skeptical, applying cold externally and taking harsh medicines internally, which led to abdominal distension and the child dying from not being able to eat. Cold and cooling agents harm the spleen&#39;s energy, while harsh medications damage the vital energy; what other outcome could there be?</p>
<p>A young child frequently experienced swelling in both legs resembling toxin, but without blisters. There was excessive phlegm and a red chin. My elder brother believed this stemmed from the kidney&#39;s deficient fire and prescribed a formula with Rehmannia root, advising both mother and child to take it, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child developed sores and scabs on both legs with a red halo that did not heal for a long time. They also used the Rehmannia root formula, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a><br>A young child had legs like clouds, moving restlessly. I first applied sesame oil to the affected area to draw out the toxic blood, which immediately dispersed the poison. Then I used a nine-ingredient detoxifying powder, and after one dose, the child was at peace.</p>
<p>Another child, due to the mother drinking wine and then nursing, was in a deep sleep and didn&#39;t wake, with their body resembling swollen red sores. I suspected that the wine&#39;s poison was transmitted to the child, so I instructed both mother and child to take kudzu root decoction to alleviate the inebriation, and they recovered.</p>
<p>A woman had a red rash like clouds, accompanied by itching and heat. This was due to heat in the blood of the liver channel. I treated her with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding raw Rehmannia, Forsythia, and Moutan, and she recovered. Generally, when a woman&#39;s menstrual cycle approaches or is irregular due to shock or anger, many exhibit this condition, which can also be treated with the aforementioned medicine.</p>
<p>A child had a swollen throat and experienced thirst, with dry and hard stool, and redness on the right cheek. This indicated excess heat in the lung and large intestine channels. I prescribed Chai Hu Decoction, and the child recovered. Later, due to food stagnation, I gave a stringent remedy, but the throat remained swollen and the abdomen bloated and painful, indicating further injury to spleen qi. I used Yi Gong San with added Sheng Ma and Angelica, and the child was cured.</p>
<p>A child suffered the previous symptoms due to maternal anger, also grinding teeth and yawning. I believed this was a sign of deficiency heat in the liver channel, so I prescribed Sweet Tangerine Decoction with additions of Chai Hu, Gardenia, and Burdock seeds, while the mother took Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, and they both recovered.</p>
<p>One child had an excessive craving for rich food, suffering from a swollen and painful throat and overflowing phlegm. After taking a purgative pill, symptoms worsened, with blood coming from the mouth and nose, sores on the lips and tongue, and unformed stools. I used Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction to clear the heat from rich food, employed Dongyuan&#39;s Anwei San to resolve the toxicity from the purgative, and additionally applied Platycodon Decoction, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a><br>A young child had swelling and pain in the throat, with the left cheek exhibiting a bluish-red color. This was due to heat in the heart and liver channels, treated successfully with Chai Hu Qing Gan San. Later, after being frightened and taking Zhi Bao Dan, the child vomited phlegm, experienced convulsions, and had cold hands and feet. This was because the liver wood was deficient and the lung metal was overpowering it, treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to strengthen the spleen and lungs, along with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver and kidney, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child presented with redness on the forehead, heat in the soles of the feet, and constant throat pain. After taking medicine to clear stomach heat and eliminate toxins, I suspected a deficiency of kidney water and excessive fire in the heart. I recommended Di Huang Wan to strengthen the water aspect to counter the yang. Not realizing, the child experienced a fiery tongue and mouth, and had painful urination, eventually leading to demise.</p>
<p>A young child presented with swelling and pain in the throat, drooling from the corners of the mouth, and warmth in the hands and feet. After using Xie Huang and Qing Wei San, both mother and child recovered. However, after the mother became very angry, the child developed a loathing for cold, fever, and resumed drooling, treated again with Chai Hu Qing Gan San plus Lou Lu, resulting in recovery for both.</p>
<p>A six-year-old girl had swelling and pain in the throat, nasal polyps, alternating chills and fevers, and frequent urination that became pale over time. This indicated liver abscess symptoms, initially treated with a modified Xiao Yao San, adding stir-fried black Xiao Long Dan. The heat and itching gradually subsided; then, the Xiao Long Dan was removed and supplemented with Si Wei Fei Er Wan, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child had itching sores and scabs around the hairline. Upon examining, it was found that the mother had liver fire. The child was treated with a modified Xiao Yao San plus Lou Lu, along with Niu Huang Jie Du Wan for detoxification, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-225p" href="#orig-225p" class="marker">[225p]</a><br>A young child had an issue at the left ear&#39;s hairline, which gradually spread upwards causing itching. This was due to heat and toxins in the liver and gallbladder meridians. The treatment used was Chaihu Qinggan San, and both mother and child took it and recovered. Later, without caution regarding rich foods, it recurred, with pus and water dripping and redness on the right cheek. This was due to heat in the stomach meridian. Initially, Qingwei San was used to clear the stomach, and then Chaihu Qinggan San was administered to treat the liver fire. Both mother and child received treatment, additionally using Lixiao San and Niuhuang Jiedu Wan, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A child experienced swelling in the jaw without color change and had constipation, indicating虚热 in the stomach meridian. The treatment was Wuwai Yigong San with added Shengma and Chaihu, leading to recovery. When the wet nurse consumed alcohol and became angry, both jaws became red and swollen, leading to increased coldness and fever. Two doses of Jiawei Qingwei San and one dose of Jiawei Xiaoyao San were used for the mother, and the child also took a few drops, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A child had swelling and pain in the jaw and chin, with pus coming from the inner ear, which had not healed for a long time. Observing the mother&#39;s face appeared green and yellow, which was due to pent-up anger, the treatment involved taking Jiawei Guipi Tang in the morning and Jiawei Xiaoyao San in the evening, leading to recovery for both mother and child.</p>
<p>A child developed a lump above the left eyebrow, initially the size of a bean, which grew to the size of a chestnut and became necrotic and painful. This indicated fire dryness in the liver meridian and a blood condition. The treatment involved Jiawei Xiaoyao San, and after about a month, the necrotic tissue fell off. Subsequently, Baizhen Tang and previous medications led to recovery.</p>
<p>A child had pus flowing from the ear, a lump in the neck, and symptoms affecting the eyes, such as being stuck or red and painful. Additionally, the child experienced itching or red urination. All these symptoms indicated wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder meridians. The treatment with Siwei Feier Wan resulted in complete recovery.<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a><br>A small child had scabs all over, with bleeding from the nose. Due to heat in the liver and spleen, they were treated with Siwei Feier Pills and recovered. Later, after consuming roasted food, the nose bled again and the scabs reappeared. They first took Qingwei Powder twice, then used Siwei Feier Pills, and after more than a month, were healed.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old girl had a polyp in her nose. After applying a toxic medicine, it turned into a sore and became swollen and painful. She was treated externally with powdered Huanglian, licorice, and Huangbo to clear the heat poison. Additionally, she took Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder to clear liver heat, combined with Siwei Feier Pills, and she recovered.</p>
<p>Another girl frequently had polyps in her nose and lower region, and she repeatedly used corrosive medicines, causing one to protrude about three inches. She was first given Longdancao Decoction as the main treatment, supplemented with Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder, and she recovered.</p>
<p>A small child was weak and had a craving for earth, charcoal, and coal ash. Later, they experienced nasal obstruction and took a heat-clearing remedy, but their body became even thinner, appetite decreased, and they suffered from extreme heat, being prone to fright and anger. Their urine turned white for a long time, and a polyp of about two inches appeared in the nose, with small nodes in the area beneath the ears and neck, hidden between muscles. I suspected this was a secondary condition due to deficiency in the liver and spleen. Not believing it, they administered internal treatments for clearing lung heat and external corrosives, leading to tissue decay in the throat. I initially used Wuwei Yigong Powder with added Shengma, Chaihu, and Wutou as the main treatment, along with Siwei Feier Pills to assist, and gradually, the spleen&#39;s qi improved. In the evening, I used Jiumei Aloe Pill as the main remedy, complemented with Wuwei Yigong Powder, and the child was healed.<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a><br>A young child suffered from smallpox for twelve days and developed a cough that did not heal for over ten days, despite taking medications to disperse the pathogen and transform phlegm. I said: This is due to deficiency of spleen and lung qi, which has further injured the true qi and led to lung abscess. Not believing me, he continued taking the prior medication, and indeed he eventually expelled pus and blood. He recovered after using Platycodon decoction.</p>
<p>Another child had recovered from smallpox, but had red, painful scars, internal heat causing thirst, and difficult urination. The late ruler used Jisheng Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction along with celery juice, leading to recovery. Later, he used Siwu Decoction and Astragalus for stability.</p>
<p>One child had white smallpox scars that occasionally itched, felt thirsty and drank soup, with thin and loose stools. The late ruler used Wumei Yigong San, adding Angelica and Astragalus, and cured him.</p>
<p>A child had white smallpox scars that sometimes itched. The late ruler believed both Qi and blood were deficient and used Eight Treasure Decoction to nourish them. Disbelieving this, he used a detoxifying remedy himself, and ultimately developed a chronic spleen wind and passed away.</p>
<p>One child had smallpox toxin corroding severely, and after applying Realgar powder and taking a modified detoxifying powder, he recovered.</p>
<p>Another child had widespread smallpox toxin leading to decay and pus oozing everywhere. After grinding frost-treated rye grass into powder and sprinkling it on the bedding, he took Jiumei detoxifying powder and recovered immediately, applying an effective Angelica ointment for healing.<a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a><br>A young child experienced swelling and pain in the knees after a smallpox infection, indicating deficiency in the spleen and kidneys leading to toxic fluid accumulation. Initially, four doses of Lifesaving Decoction were given, resulting in a significant reduction of swelling and pain. Following that, a restorative formula to replenish energy was used, along with Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill, resulting in a complete recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had swelling and ulceration in the legs, with continual discharge of pus and internal heat causing fatigue and weight loss, indicating further damage to the spleen and stomach. Six doses of the Eight-Treasure Decoction and Six-Flavor Pills were administered, and after more than three months, the child recovered.</p>
<p>A child presented with dense smallpox, first suffering from pus-filled lesions on the limbs that healed, but later developed oral thrush, affecting the gums. One dose each of Large Wormwood Decoction and Lifesaving Decoction was given, followed by Clear Stomach Powder with Rhinoceros Horn and Toad Pills for recovery. Afterward, the child experienced fever and thirst, along with mouth pain; Toad Pills were administered, and Yellow Powder was rubbed on the philtrum for comfort.</p>
<p>A child with rashes experienced pain, fever, and thirst, wishing to take a cooling drink. Upon pulse examination, it was noted that the pulse was weak and did not count distinctly, indicating that the evil was in the meridians and thus should not be treated with purgatives. Consequently, two doses of Detoxification and Wind Prevention Decoction were administered, resulting in recovery. This condition often occurs in children, requiring careful examination to distinguish between surface and internal ailments and the severity of the evil for treatment. Wang Haizang stated: &quot;Why should both the beginning and end not be purged?&quot; The answer is: &quot;The beginning should not be purged because the rash has not yet appeared on the surface, and purging would prevent the evils from fully manifesting. This pulse condition shows a presence at the surface without internal conditions, so purging the beginning is prohibited. The end should not be purged because the rash toxins are already evident externally, with no roots or solid foundation internally; if the bowel movement is not substantial and there are no other internal conditions, purging would cause the rash to sink, thus it is forbidden to purge at the end.&quot;<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a><br>A child experiences itching and fever. A dose of disinfected rhinoceros horn is given, causing vomiting and diarrhea. This expels the pathogenic Qi both up and down, and the poison resolves on its own. After a while, both vomiting and diarrhea cease, and the rash dissipates. After the vomiting and diarrhea, the pulse shows seven beats—this is the pulse of a peaceful child, indicating the evil has been eradicated, and there is no need for further treatment to cure the rash. </p>
<p>Jie Gu states: In the case of rashes and spots, the symptoms vary. If there is redness and swelling on the surface, it belongs to the lesser yang and the triple burner’s fire, referred to as “spots.” If there are small red dots beneath the skin that do not surface, this pertains to the lesser yin and the imperial fire, called “rashes.” In general, for evident spot conditions, if there is self-induced vomiting and diarrhea, one must be cautious not to treat indiscriminately, for this indicates the pathogenic Qi is expelled both up and down. </p>
<p>When spots and rashes manifest together, children are often unable to withstand this; hence, it can develop into other symptoms. The beginning and end should not be treated lightly. Generally, there are many medications that stabilize the interior and few that promote external release. It is essential to gently guide the Qi, preventing blockage, and allow it to exit in sequence, making it easier for the child to withstand. A warm body is treated with soothing methods, while a cool body requires stimulating treatment.<a id="trans-230p" href="#orig-230p" class="marker">[230p]</a><br>A young child with a completely red body was treated with acupuncture, and he immediately recovered after taking detoxifying medicine. Another child, also fully red, did not agree to acupuncture treatment, which resulted in toxic energy entering his abdomen, ultimately leading to his demise. This condition is due to venomous hot blood accumulating in the vital gate, igniting when encountering internal fire. If it resembles scattered clouds, the bad blood must be drained for recovery. If there is swelling and redness that is unstable, one should first apply fresh hemp oil to the affected area, then perform acupuncture to release the poison. Any condition that starts from the limbs and enters the abdomen should not be treated. Although there are several varieties of pills and methods of treatment, none are as effective as acupuncture. It is commonly seen that cases that are somewhat severe and do not use acupuncture methods are not cured.<a id="trans-231p" href="#orig-231p" class="marker">[231p]</a><br>A girl, thirteen years old, had a pale yellow complexion, a sore on the left side of her head, a swollen neck, alternating chills and fevers, and difficulties with bowel movements. I believed this was caused by the liver’s wood element insulting the spleen and a deficiency of vital energy. The chills and fevers were not from external pathogens, and the constipation was not due to internal heat. She did not believe me and continued to take various medications, later developing diarrhea, and her sore became infested with lice. I treated her with a formula combining Six Gentlemen Decoction with Sheng Ma, Chai Hu, and Wu Yi as the main ingredients, supplemented with the Nine-Flavored Aloe Pill. All symptoms resolved, and the swelling in her neck disappeared.</p>
<p>A boy had a pale yellow complexion, experienced pain in the heart and abdomen, occasionally wanted to vomit, and sometimes had a dribbling urination or itching on the penis. I thought it was due to wind-heat in the liver channel insulting the spleen, but he did not believe me, and later, he developed scabs all over his body and was infested with lice. I treated him with Four Flavored Infant Pill and a variation of Six Gentlemen Decoction, and he soon recovered.</p>
<p>Another boy had a long-standing arm abscess that had ruptured, suffered diarrhea after eating, felt heaviness in his lower abdomen, and had a complexion that was either withered yellow or deathly pale. His pulse was short, barely registering. This indicated a deficiency of spleen energy with cold sinking down, hindering proper transformation. I used an Eight-Flavored Pill to nourish the fire of the life-gate, supplemented with Energy Boosting Decoction to support spleen energy. After a month, he gradually improved; later, I added the Two Divine Pills, and after more than two months, the sore healed completely.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a><br>A young child had a leg ulcer that, upon breaking, caused diarrhea, poor appetite, cold hands and feet, mostly occurring in the early morning and late at night. This indicates a transformation of the spleen and stomach to deficiency and cold. Treatment with the Four Divine Pill, Six Gentlemen Decoction, ginger, and cinnamon gradually yielded improvement, followed by the intermittent use of Qi Tonic Decoction leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had a long-standing anal abscess that did not heal, accompanied by diarrhea, a yellowed face, and cold hands and feet with a heavy sensation in the lower abdomen. This is a severe manifestation of weakened spleen qi and its descent. In the morning, a Qi Tonic Decoction was administered containing five qian of ginseng and two qian of white atractylodes; in the evening, a modified Yigong Powder was given with three qian of ginseng and two qian of white atractylodes. Additionally, ginseng (one liang) was decocted in place of tea. After more than two months, the child recovered. At seventeen, after marriage, the child suffered from anal abscess and diarrhea, with cold hands and feet—nearly life-threatening. I diagnosed it as weakened fire at the mingmen, treating it with Eight Flavor Pill and Qi Tonic Decoction leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child had flowing sores that, after breaking, caused diarrhea and difficulty in digesting food. I attributed it to weak spleen qi and treated it with Six Gentlemen Decoction, leading to recovery. However, after resuming food, diarrhea persisted, and cold hands and feet were noted. Using Six Gentlemen Decoction along with ginger and cinnamon was ineffective, so I used one liang of ginseng and five qian of aconite in several doses, leading to a gradual reduction of symptoms. Then, a month of using Ginseng Decoction resulted in complete recovery.</p>
<p>A young child had scrofula and diarrhea, with a cyanotic face and abdominal bloating. Close examination revealed that the mother&#39;s nipple and breast were painful, indicating that the breast belongs to the stomach and the nipple to the liver. This indicates that the liver wood was overpowering the spleen earth. The child’s illness was directly related to this condition, indicating a shared affliction with the mother. In the morning, Qi Tonic Decoction was used; in the evening, Six Gentlemen Decoction along with licorice and Bupleurum served as the main treatment, supplemented by Four Ingredients Tonic Pill. Both mother and child took the medicine together and recovered.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a><br>A young child suffered from tuberculosis and, after taking a toxic medicine, experienced fever, anxiety, thirst, and vomiting. This indicated further damage to the vital energy. I used Ba Zhen Decoction, increasing the doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes, which gradually brought relief; I also used Si Jun Decoction, angelica, and Cimicifuga to help stabilize the condition.</p>
<p>Another child had tuberculosis with diarrhea, and after taking a purgative, had difficulty urinating, a yellow face, and poor appetite. I diagnosed this as due to deficiency of the spleen and lungs, which were unable to distribute energy to the organs. In the morning, I used an energy-boosting decoction, and in the evening, I used Yi Gong Powder, which resolved all symptoms.</p>
<p>In another case, a young child had tuberculosis accompanied by diarrhea, a pale face, and abdominal distension. This was due to spleen deficiency and liver transgression. I primarily used Yi Gong Powder, with Si Wei Fat Child Pills as a supplement, and the symptoms gradually improved; ultimately, I switched to using Fat Child Pills as the main treatment, with Yi Gong Powder as a supplement, which led to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had a persistent sore on the buttocks that had not healed for a long time, accompanied by diarrhea, irregular urination, fever, and thirst. I suspected that the kidneys, which open to the two lower orifices, were the cause of the urinary irregularity, resulting from deficiency of kidney energy leading to heat. I used local treatments such as Di Huang Pill and energy-boosting decoction, which gradually alleviated the main symptoms, helped the flesh grow back, and the sore healed itself.</p>
<p>In yet another case, a young child had tuberculosis combined with diarrhea, appearing thin and weak. This was a case of liver and spleen deficiency. After giving three doses of Yi Gong Powder and one dose of Kema Pills, the child recovered within a month.<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a><br>A young boy of fifteen had developed an interest in women but suffered from an ailment. He took Xuan San for a long time without improvement. I suggested he should strongly replenish his vital energy, but he did not believe me, resulting in severe chills and fever, occasional thirst with phlegm, dizziness, and warmth in his extremities. Afterward, both his urine and stools caused him pain, and his body became stiff. I attributed this to a deficiency of essence and blood, leading to loss. I treated him with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan, and advised him to take two taels of ginseng brewed as tea instead of water daily. He recovered in three months.</p>
<p>Another boy, aged nine, complained of leg pain. I applied a scallion compress and administered a large dose of Fang Feng Tang. As swelling and redness developed, I alternated between Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, which gradually reduced the swelling. I also used Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang in alternation with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. Every two to three days, I applied a scallion compress, and after more than two months, the swelling completely subsided.</p>
<p>A different boy suffered from a non-stop ulcer, experienced fatigue, had a reduced appetite, felt dry and feverish, especially worsening in the afternoon. This indicated severe deficiency of the spleen qi. I administered five doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to replenish his vital energy and added one dose of Da Fang Feng Tang to treat his ulcer. After more than a month, all symptoms disappeared, and I then used Shi Quan Da Bu Tang combined with Da Fang Feng Tang to aid recovery.</p>
<p>Another boy had a non-healing ulcer, intermittent chills and fevers, and reddish, painful urination, indicative of blood and qi deficiency. I used Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, adding Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, and all symptoms rapidly receded. I then removed the cinnamon and advised him to take it regularly, supplemented with He Qi Ding Tong Wan until he was cured.<a id="trans-235p" href="#orig-235p" class="marker">[235p]</a><br>A woman suffers from pain in her left leg, taking remedies like Liuqi drink; her left knee is swollen and hard, with phlegm and coughing. I believe this to be &quot;crane knee wind.&quot; Her pulse is taut and rapid with little strength, indicating a deficiency in the liver, spleen, and kidney channels. Both the physical and energetic aspects are deficient; thus, we should primarily nourish the spleen and stomach. If one doubts this and continues to expel the pathogenic qi, various symptoms will arise. Initially, I used Wuwei Yigong San with added Shengma, Ganjiang, and Rougui to strengthen the spleen qi a bit; then I used Yigong San and Bajian Tang, which led to an improvement; finally, I intermittently took Dafengfeng Tang and Dihuang Wan, resulting in a complete recovery.</p>
<p>A child experiences gradual swelling in both knees, treated with detoxifying medicines, but his legs and shins are red and swollen. This indicates a deficiency of the father&#39;s kidney qi; I utilized Dihuang Bajian Tang to alleviate the swelling. If detoxifying and pest-repelling medicines are used, it will certainly lead to a worsening condition.</p>
<p>Another child, aged fifteen, had a leg abscess that was healing but then developed diarrhea. I prescribed Buzhong Yiqi Tang and Liu Junzi Tang, and he recovered. Later, due to overexertion and irregular eating, the diarrhea returned. I believed his stomach qi had not yet recovered and continued the previous treatment. If one doubts this and instead takes diarrhea-inducing medicine, the diarrhea will not cease and may lead to demise. The stomach qi must be harmonious; when food enters the stomach, the essence is transported to the spleen and then rises to the lungs, circulating through the hundred vessels to create nourishment and defense. If food intake is improper and daily routines are mismanaged, it damages the stomach qi, causing the essence to descend and resulting in diarrhea. Without uplifting yang and replenishing qi, a cure is impossible.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a><br>A young child suffered from ulcers, was irritable, and had convulsions. Six Flavor Rehmannia Pills were brewed and taken to nourish the kidneys and liver. Five Flavor Adaptation Powder was used to tonify the spleen and lungs, leading to gradual improvement; later, Ba Zhen Decoction was administered, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had a rash, took sweat-inducing medicine, and became thirsty and irritable. Initially, Dang Gui Blood Nourishing Decoction and Dong Yuan Sheng Yu Decoction were used, gradually stabilizing the symptoms; subsequently, Ba Zhen Decoction was given with the addition of Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>One child experienced tidal fevers from the late afternoon until midnight, had a rash all over resembling scabies, suffered from constipation and red, painful urine, and had a craving for cold drinks. This was due to excessive heat in the spleen and stomach affecting the lungs and large intestine. Four doses of Cool Decoction were first administered, beginning to alleviate the heat; then, Si Wu Decoction was used with the addition of Chai Hu and Huang Lian for several doses, resulting in gradual healing. Seeking a quicker effect, another remedy similar to Huai Jiao Pills was used, but symptoms worsened. The parents then requested the chief physician for treatment, who also used the previous medicines, only adding Tao Ren and Chi Shao, resulting in a cure after a hundred doses.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials of Ulcers and Lumps&quot; states: A child suffered from a skin condition on the entire body resembling an epidemic, sometimes itchy and painful, with emaciation, experiencing fever day and night, dry mouth and thirst, and irregular bowel movements for over a year. This was due to accumulation of food and stagnant heat in the liver and spleen. Aloe Vera Pills were used, leading to recovery within a month.<a id="trans-237p" href="#orig-237p" class="marker">[237p]</a><br>A child had a buildup of food and took a remedy to alleviate stagnation, resulting in sores on his body similar to scabies. After consuming detoxifying medicine, he developed bumps that were red and itchy, with pus soaking through. I initially used a modified Wuwei Yigong powder with Chaihu and Shan Zhi to nourish the spleen and stomach and pacify the liver, which gradually reduced the redness and itching. I also treated him with the Sihui Feier Wan and continued with the Wuwei Yigong powder, leading to the resolution of the food stagnation.</p>
<p>Another child had sores all over, irregular urination, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, and his eyes were suffering from a cross-eyed condition. After administering a wind-dispelling remedy, his eyebrows fell out. I diagnosed this as a sign of wind-heat attacking the liver channel and first used a large dose of Aloe Vera pills, followed by Sihui Feier Wan, resulting in gradual improvement. Later, due to food stagnation and fever, his sores reappeared. I treated him with Da Wuzi decoction and Sihui Feier Wan, leading to full recovery. From then on, whenever he ceased eating, he developed red, itchy eruptions, but taking Sihui Feier Wan resolved them.</p>
<p>A child presented with widespread sores resembling scabies, experiencing itching, weight loss, fever, swollen gums, thirst, and loose stools, indicating a condition of the kidney and liver. I started treatment with Di Huang Wan and then used Da Wuzi decoction, which resulted in recovery. However, due to dietary harm, his sores flared up again, and I first used Sihui Feier Wan followed by Da Wuzi decoction, which led to healing.</p>
<p>One child had sores all over his body resembling scabies, experiencing either itchiness or pain, with pus oozing, eyebrows falling out, foul-smelling stools, and clear white urine. I diagnosed it as a condition of liver and spleen, treating him initially with a large dose of Aloe Vera pills, followed by Sihui Feier Wan, which gradually improved his symptoms.

I first used Chai Hu and Zhi Zi, then employed Da Luohui Wan and Si Wei Fei Er Wan, leading to slight improvement; subsequently, I used Xia Ma Wan and Si Wu Fei Er Wan, which resulted in a complete recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child presented with facial swelling and body lesions resembling ringworm. After six months, these transformed into lumps, appearing purple and itchy. Applying medicines like Ba Dou caused the skin to break and ooze, accompanied by pain, itching, cold, heat, and hard stools, with a full and rapid pulse in the spleen and lungs. Initially, I used Fang Feng Tong Sheng San to resolve both exterior and interior issues and to promote harmony. Later, I employed Si Wu Tang with the addition of Jing Fang, Huang Qin, Chai Hu, Zao Jiao Ci, and Gan Cao Jie to cool the blood and dispel toxins, leading to gradual improvement. Furthermore, I administered Ba Zhen Tang with Bai Zhu, Jing, Fang, Zao Jiao Ci, and Wu Jia Pi until full recovery.</p>
<p>However, after neglecting dietary restrictions, the child developed sores all over, resembling a contagion, with extremely foul-smelling stools, a distended abdomen with visible veins, and hair that became frizzy. Initially, I used Fei Er Wan for over a month, then prescribed Da Wu Yi Tang several times, followed by Da Luohui Wan and Si Wei Fei Er Wan, which ultimately resulted in a return to health.<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a><br>A girl, twelve years old, had a tendency to anger, which caused her entire body to itch and emit fluid.

After half a year, red marks appeared all over her body, and at times she experienced dizziness and chills. I said: This is also due to excessive liver fire, causing her blood to become heated and act recklessly. That night, she indeed experienced a menstrual flow. Later, due to dryness in the liver meridian, sores developed, accompanied by heat and itching, and she scratched until they leaked fluid and lost facial hair. Using Daluohui pills and Siwu Erlian Decoction, the heat subsided; and with Wuwu Yigong powder and Siwei Feier pills, the sores healed.<a id="trans-240p" href="#orig-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a><br>A young boy had sores all over his body, with blood in his stool, fever, thirst, a distended abdomen with visible veins, and gradually falling eyebrows.

<p>Another boy, aged fifteen, had a body that appeared to be infested with scabies but was not, with pus and water seeping, evening fevers, and a dry mouth, looking emaciated for four years. This was a sign of kidney deficiency. I used Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, and he recovered. Later, he experienced itching in the genitals, clear white urine, and sores resembling scabies like a strong wind. I used the major aloe vera pill and the Four Flavor Fat Child pill, and all symptoms gradually improved; then I used the Da Wuyi Decoction, resulting in recovery. Later, he had a cessation of food, vomiting, diarrhea, and didn&#39;t eat, with a flush (appearing red).

By brewing Shengma Decoction to accompany the Qingwan Pill, the child gradually recovers, and birch bark powder is used for further healing.</p>
<p>Another young child exhibits all-over itching with red rashes that eventually lead to persistent pus. Initially, two doses of Guipi Decoction are administered, followed by sesame powder, leading to recovery. Later, due to shock accompanied by eating, fever arises with red rashes.

<p>Han&#39;s son, aged fourteen, early lost his innocence, with a red, swollen face resembling wind symptoms, occasionally experiencing twitching. He mistakenly took medications for epidemic wind, leading to internal deficiency and fever with dry mouth and thirst. In the winter of the Year of the Rabbit, upon requesting treatment, it was noted: this is a case of internal injury due to deficiency, where shadowy fire rises, resembling red wandering wind symptoms. The treatment should nourish Yin to lower the fire; strengthening the root will cause the symptoms to subside. Forty doses of Si Jun Decoction, enhanced with ginseng and astragalus, were used, and this was formed into pills for oral intake. Within two months, the condition improved.

<p>One child suffered from itchy rashes and restlessness due to fever and was treated with Xiaofeng powder. Another child presented similar symptoms, coughed and vomited, and was healed by drinking a soup made of Gegeng and orange peel.</p>
<p>A child had several blisters on the neck, face, chest, and abdomen, which turned into sores. This was due to wind evil invading the skin and is termed &quot;boil sores.&quot; The child was treated with Jingfang Baidu powder and an application of burnt cow dung, resulting in recovery. A particularly severe case of boil sores, resembling the size of millet, often occurs on fingers, and if it opens and bleeds, one should apply powdered Nanjing star, Banxia, and Baizhi. In more severe cases, the bone may be visible, and symptoms may include delirium and agitation.</p>
<p>A child with white sores on the head had smooth skin and showed no response to various medications; this is named &quot;brain sores,&quot; formed from fetal toxins combined with wind heat. Treatment included taking Longdancao pills and blowing aloe powder into the nose, along with applying detoxifying powder, resulting in healing. In severe cases, there was firm swelling like a grain ear, and heat in the brain like fire, with sweating all over the body, swelling of the cheeks, and elevated chest; in such cases, this medicine should particularly be administered.<a id="trans-244p" href="#orig-244p" class="marker">[244p]</a><br>A child had several sores on the head and face that were itchy and weeping, and where the fluid flowed, sores developed, known as impetigo. A powder made of mung bean flour and pine resin was applied with sesame oil; the child was given a decoction of Jingfang Baidu San, and recovered.</p>
<p>Another child had a sore outside the nose, which was rubbed frequently, affecting both ears. Various medicines were ineffective until Aloe Vera pills were taken, along with the application of pine resin and leaf bean powder, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A child had several sores on the head and face that were itchy, with crusts accumulating, referred to as sticky sores. A powder made of dry white alum and yellow lead was mixed with sesame oil for application; the child also drank Baidu San and recovered.</p>
<p>One child, after recovering from smallpox, had several pockmarks on the leg that became concave ulcers. A mixture of realgar and verdigris powder was applied. Additionally, the child took honeysuckle powder several times and recovered. If the condition spread all over, use silkworm cocoons, fill them with powdered white alum, burn them until the juice dries, remove and powder it, then place it on the ground, covering with a bowl for a long time to extract the poison from the fire, applying it effectively.</p>
<p>A child had itching after smallpox, scratching it open into sores with pus and water oozing out. I used frost-dried grass as powder for application and also laid it on the bedding, along with the consumption of honeysuckle powder, leading to recovery. Using mung bean or talc powder for application is also possible, but it is not as quick acting as the grass.<a id="trans-245p" href="#orig-245p" class="marker">[245p]</a><br>A child has a cough with wheezing, strong fever and chills, skin resembling millet, itchy nose with running mucus, sore throat, mouth sores with red vomit, abdominal bloating with burned fur, and diarrhea, which is called lung sore. It was treated with a drink of Rehmannia to clear the lungs and a pill for expelling parasites, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A three-year-old child suffers from painful toxic swelling in the arm; after taking detox pills and applying a special powder, it subsides. For constipation or irritability, taking the Five Blessings detox pill is also effective. If pus has formed, it should be urgently punctured. Use a paper twist dipped in sesame oil to apply to the wound, then cover with a plaster. If the child is calm, there is no need for medication; wait for the pus to be removed and continue with the dressing. </p>
<p>For children whose sores do not heal or recur, it is often due to the mother consuming roasted, spicy foods, or because there is heat in the body. It is advisable to treat the mother&#39;s heat first by adding licorice decoction to her medicine, which will also help the child&#39;s sores heal. If the child cannot take medicine due to the previous symptoms, add licorice to the medicine and have the mother take it, which will also help the child&#39;s sores.</p>
<p>A child suffers from variola and has discomfort; upon pressing, the symptoms recur. This is due to swelling and pain from the pus. It is then punctured to remove the pus, leading to healing. After variola, if the limbs and joints swell without redness, administer honeysuckle powder; also apply a mixture of ground raw soybeans and hot water for dressing, keeping it moist. If after six or seven days the swelling does not subside and pus has formed, it should be urgently punctured, and the pus-removing medicine must be taken.<a id="trans-246p" href="#orig-246p" class="marker">[246p]</a><br>The &quot;Essential Experience Manual&quot; states: A young child with a foot injury feels pain, but the flesh color remains unchanged, indicating that the injury is in the bone. Regularly applying fried scallions relieves it, and at dawn, taking the Blood-Regulating Pain-Reducing Pills helps alleviate the pain. During the day, taking tonics for the spleen and stomach to promote qi and blood is beneficial. After several days, taking Di Huang Pills leads to recovery in over three months.</p>
<p>A young child had a dislocated arm bone that became swollen, painful, and hot. Taking medications for qi flow proves very helpful, but there was little appetite. I applied scallions to relieve the pain immediately; then treated it with Liu Jun Zi Decoction, Astragalus, Bupleurum, Platycodon, Dipsacus, and Fracture Bone to help digestion and reduce swelling. Afterward, I used a formula to tonify the middle and enhance qi, adding wheat and five flavors, which harmonized qi and blood, causing the heat to retreat and resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A young child suffered a sprain, with swollen legs and ankles, feeling weak and timid. I wanted to primarily treat it with tonics for qi and blood, supplemented by dispersing agents. However, he insisted on taking the qi flow drink internally and applying cooling herbs externally, which caused a tiring combination of cold and heat. I stated that the intense chills and fever, along with a very broad pulse, indicated severe qi and blood deficiency, leading to ineffective treatment. Eventually, he lost all yang qi and blood due to internal depletion.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A young child had red rashes on the arm; upon using a stone to draw out the toxic blood, he recovered. Confused by others&#39; words, he took Hu Xin Powder to prevent future issues. After taking it, he experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal bloating, while the affected area turned red again, with cold hands and feet. I diagnosed this as weakness in the spleen and stomach, compounded by the previous medicine&#39;s harm. A single dose of Liu Jun Zi Decoction immediately cured him; I then added herbs from the Yi Gong San with Cimicifuga and Bupleurum for a complete recovery.<a id="trans-247p" href="#orig-247p" class="marker">[247p]</a><br>A child suffered from this condition, with difficulty in urination and defecation, both the scrotum and abdomen swollen. Urgently, the needle method was employed, using a life-saving drink with herbs like leolu, mutong, and dahuang ground into powder, taken with hot wine. After some time, both urination and defecation were resolved, and all symptoms instantly retreated; then the three herbs were removed, and the child continued to recover.</p>
<p>Another child suffered similarly, with difficulty in urination and defecation, abdominal distension, and cough. A life-saving drink with leolu, mutong, and mahhuang was used, taken frequently with hot wine. Urination and defecation followed, the child sweated all over, and all symptoms receded. The child’s breath seemed weak, lacking energy, occasionally becoming agitated. As the pathogenic energy left, the original energy was deficient. Urgently, a Danggui blood-replenishing soup was used, and the child recovered.</p>
<p>A different child had this condition all over their body and was cured after taking Niuhuang Jiedu Wan, except for scabs on the head that itched and oozed. This was due to deficient kidney energy with internal heat, treated with Dihuang Wan to resolve toxicity, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child experienced itching on the hairline, and examination of the mother revealed liver fire. A modified Xiaoyao San with leolu, along with Niuhuang Jiedu Wan and detoxifying powders, was used, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A child had itching at the left ear near the hairline, extending up to the head. This was due to heat and toxicity in the liver and gallbladder meridians. Chaihu Qinggan San was administered, and both mother and child took it, resulting in recovery. However, after indulging in rich food again, the symptoms recurred: pus and fluid oozed from the right cheek, which indicated heat in the stomach meridian. First, a Qingsan for the stomach was used, then Chaihu Qinggan San to treat the liver fire, taken by both mother and child. Additionally, Liyou San and Niuhuang Jiedu Wan were used for recovery.<a id="trans-248p" href="#orig-248p" class="marker">[248p]</a><br>A young child suffered from a condition affecting both eyebrows, which spread to the entire body and limbs, causing oozing pus and alternating chills and fevers. This was attributed to excess heat in the liver and spleen. Treatments with Clear Stomach Powder, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, and Immediate Effect Powder resulted in recovery. Subsequently, the child had a recurrence between the eyebrows, with the eyes connected and cloudy urine. Treatment with Four Ingredients for Children Pills and Nine Ingredients Aloe Vera Pills led to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child suffered because the wet nurse did not avoid strong emotions and rich flavors, leading to a prolonged ailment. The mother used Clear Stomach and Free and Easy Wanderer powders, and the child took Niu Huang Detox Pills, resulting in recovery. Later, due to the child consuming sweet flavors, sores appeared between the eyebrows, accompanied by itching and painful eyes. Treatment with Four Ingredients for Children Pills as the main remedy, supplemented by Enhanced Free and Easy Wanderer Powder and Clear Stomach Powder, led to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had the condition affecting the whole body, with severe symptoms in both sides. The child was treated with Four Ingredients for Children Pills and Immediate Effect Powder, while the mother used Chai Hu and Zhi Zi Powder, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>One child experienced this condition between the ribs, with chills and fever resembling malaria, and frequent urination. This was due to liver fire. Initially, Chai Hu Clear Liver Powder was used, followed by Enhanced Free and Easy Wanderer Powder, leading to recovery. Afterwards, due to the wet nurse&#39;s liver fire being stirred up, it recurred. They used Enhanced Free and Easy Wanderer Powder along with Eight Treasures Decoction, adding peony root and gardenia, and both mother and child recovered.</p>
<p>A child had this condition in the abdomen, experiencing fever, bloody stools, a pale face, little appetite, occasional vomiting or diarrhea, cold hands and feet, and a tense right pulse. This was due to weakness in the spleen and excess liver fire. Treatment began with Five Flavors Different Efficacy Powder, supplemented with Sheng Ma, Chai Hu, and Gardenia to benefit liver qi and clear liver fire. Later, Di Huang Pills nourished kidney water to generate liver blood, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-249p" href="#orig-249p" class="marker">[249p]</a><br>A boy had a condition on the inner thigh, with redness that wouldn&#39;t heal, accompanied by fever and a face that occasionally appeared bluish. This was due to insufficient kidney yin and excessive wood and fire. Initially, Chai Hu Zhi Zi San was used to clear the liver and heart, followed by Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver and kidneys, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another boy experienced symptoms between the elbow, feeling thirsty for cold drinks, with a rapid yet weak pulse at the right cun point. This heat accumulated in the stomach channel and transmitted to the lung channel. First, Xie Huang and Xie Bai powders were gradually used, followed by Wu Wei Yi Gong San and Si Wei Fei Er Wan for recovery.</p>
<p>A boy who indulged in rich and sweet foods first developed symptoms on his back and then experienced profuse sweating all over. This was due to heat from diet injuring the spleen&#39;s blood. Initially, Qing Wei and Xie Huang powders were used to heal; however, given his weak physique, Wu Wei Yi Gong San was administered to restore his vital energy.</p>
<p>A boy had a poison on the inner front side of the thigh, which after ulceration became swollen and hard with a dark color, and the pus was clear and uncontained, while his complexion appeared bluish-yellow. This condition stemmed from spleen deficiency and liver excess with cold evil invading the affected area. The focus was to strengthen the vital energy. Initially, Yi Gong San with added Chai Hu, Sheng Ma, and scallion poultices were used. As the spleen&#39;s energy gradually recovered, the affected area began to heal. Additionally, Ba Zhen Tang and Dou Chi cakes were used for further recovery.</p>
<p>A boy had pain and swelling on the outer side of the leg, with normal flesh color. After administering Tuo Li Xiao Du San in two doses, the swelling initially turned red. After four more doses, the swelling and redness subsided, and after six doses it ulcerated, producing thin pus. He experienced reduced appetite and fatigue. Yi Gong San was then combined with Chuan Xiong and Gui to continue using Tuo Li San, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-250p" href="#orig-250p" class="marker">[250p]</a><br>A child had a small swelling that was hard and did not change color; this was due to a deficiency of vital energy that could not produce pus. Use Tori San and Ru Sheng Bing to treat it. If the swelling was red, use Tori Xiao Du San to help it matter and then needle it, gradually recovering with Ba Zhen Tang plus cinnamon. Due to eating injuries causing diarrhea, the affected area was pale, and the child had little appetite or thought about food. First use Liu Jun and dried ginger, followed by Ba Zhen Tang and scallion compresses to heal.</p>
<p>Another child suffered from this for a long time, with clear and thin pus, a sallow complexion, and a large abdomen with visible veins. This was due to a deficiency of spleen energy being bullied by the liver. In the morning, provide Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and in the evening, use Wu Wei Yi Gong San. The original energy gradually recovered; then, combine it with Si Wei Fei Er Wan and scallion compresses. After more than two months, the child healed.</p>
<p>A child had a swelling on the outside of the leg; taking detoxifying medicine significantly increased the swelling, and the child was emaciated with reduced appetite. Pain worsened. I said: If swelling occurs first followed by pain, it’s a structural injury affecting energy; if pain occurs first and then swelling, it’s energy injuring the structure. One should replenish the Yang energy. If you don’t believe this and continue to use laxative medicine, the result may be fatal. &quot;Essentials&quot; state: When the Qi of nourishment and defense is full but unable to move, it stagnates, causing blockage of Qi and blood, and rotting into abscesses—this should be released to neutralize the heat. If a person has poor appetite, weak spirit, and weak vital energy with thin muscles, the Qi of nourishment and defense becomes constricted and stagnated; therefore, cold can penetrate the pores and cause abscesses, which should be treated by strengthening the weak energy. Indeed, this is true.<a id="trans-251p" href="#orig-251p" class="marker">[251p]</a><br>Wuwei, the official Zai Fangzi, completed his term and was to return home, but passed away three days later. When inquired about the cause, he claimed there was no illness, only that he had a blister on the middle finger of his left hand, not knowing it was a red thread sore.</p>
<p>Additionally, Wei Tihua&#39;s lovely person mentioned that a neighbor&#39;s daughter suddenly developed a blister on her middle finger, which was extremely clear with a bottom full of tiny holes, distinctly countable, and a red thread was present beside it. The whole family laughed. Suddenly, an old woman came and exclaimed, &quot;This is a red thread sore; it will endanger your life!&quot; She quickly burned mugwort several times over the blister and pricked the thread in several places, thus saving her.</p>
<p>A young boy had five sores on his neck after falling into the grass. Upon examination, his mother was often very angry and frequently had chills and fever, with pains in her chest and slight swelling in her sides, all indicating liver and gallbladder problems. He first used Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Dong Quai and Peony, and the chills and fever immediately subsided. Subsequently, he applied a modified version of the Xiao Yao San, and after two months of treatment for the mother, the child also recovered.</p>
<p>Another child suffered due to the heat in his wet nurse&#39;s liver channel, having issues in front of and behind his ears. After treating the mother with a modified Xiao Yao San, the child also recovered.<a id="trans-252p" href="#orig-252p" class="marker">[252p]</a><br>A young child had a lump beneath each ear for three years. After taking disinfectant medicine for a long time, the condition worsened, and their vital energy diminished. The mother, whose liver and spleen blood were deficient and had heat due to pent-up anger, was treated with a modified Gui Pi decoction as the primary remedy, supplemented with a modified Xiao Yao powder. The mother&#39;s heat gradually subsided; the child was given several spoonfuls daily, and after more than two months, the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another child, since infancy, had four lumps on the neck. By age five, there were lumps in front of and behind the ears, with extremely deficient vital energy, alternating cold and heat, and trouble drinking milk. This was attributed to stagnation in the liver and gallbladder channels. Eight Treasure Decoction and Xiao Yao powder were used, both commonly taken by robust women, and the child drank their milk. After half a year, the child gradually became stronger, and the lumps began to dissipate. The child also took Di Huang pills and Xiao Yao powder and was completely healed.</p>
<p>A child had three lumps on the neck, and the intention was to apply medicine, but the condition extended to the front of the ears. I believed this was caused by issues in the liver and gallbladder channels. Examining the mother, her liver and gallbladder pulses were still strong and rapid. I concluded that the mother and child were connected, and by treating the mother, the child would naturally heal. Doubting me, they took a specific remedy that resulted in vomiting and diarrhea, leading to death by morning.</p>
<p>Another child had oozing pus and unabsorbed lumps, with increased fever and chill. This indicated deficiency of qi and blood in the liver with accompanying heat. The primary remedy was a Yin-replenishing Eight Treasure Decoction, interspersed with a Clear Liver and Nourish Flourishing Decoction, leading to recovery. Afterward, the child developed new lumps, and the urination was reddish and painful, experiencing evening fevers and thirst. The primary treatment was Shen Zhu Zi Ling Decoction, supplemented by Liu Wei Di Huang Wan combined with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, and Si Wei Fei Er Wan, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-253p" href="#orig-253p" class="marker">[253p]</a><br>A young boy, fifteen years old, suffered from this condition, experienced fever and thirst, had red cheeks in the evening, and exhibited a weak, rapid pulse, indicating Yin deficiency with heat. I used the Eight Precious Decoction with additional ginseng and astragalus for fifty doses, followed by another twenty doses, after which it burst forth. However, the pus was clear and watery, and the flesh did not regenerate, indicating weak spleen Qi. I primarily used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes, assisted by peony, cooked rehmannia, ophiopogon, and schisandra, which restored Qi and blood. Consequently, I administered the Must-Effect Powder once, expelling the toxins and achieving recovery.</p>
<p>Another young boy presented with similar issues and, after taking the medicine administered for treatment, developed chills, fever, and abdominal distension, indicating liver and spleen deficiency syndrome. I first utilized the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder with added bupleurum and ephedra and supplemented it with the Nine-Flavored Aloe Vera Pill, gradually improving the condition. I then employed the Four-Flavored Nourishing Pills and the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder to reduce the symptoms.</p>
<p>A nine-year-old boy suffered from this condition, having a constant greenish complexion, with hard swellings that did not burst, and unchanged flesh color. This indicated liver Qi stagnation transforming into phlegm. I advised that we only need to regulate and nourish the liver and spleen. Doubting my words, the pathology of deficiency surged; he sought my treatment again, still wanting to attack the liver. I remarked: A greenish face indicates liver deficiency, revealing its original color; a whiter complexion signifies lung deficiency; phlegm rising indicates spleen deficiency, which fails to contain it; two tightly closed eyes suggest liver blood deficiency leading to wind. The classic states: the stomach is the root of the five organs; we must first rescue the stomach Qi. I proceeded with the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder, adding ephedra and bupleurum, slightly recuperating the vital energy. In the morning, I administered the Middle-Boosting and Qi-Increasing Decoction, and in the evening, the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder with supplementation from the Nine-Flavored Aloe Vera Pill. Gradually, the complexion began to turn yellow, and the lumps started to dissipate. I then alternated administering the Four-Flavored Nourishing Pills with cooked rehmannia pills until he recovered.<a id="trans-254p" href="#orig-254p" class="marker">[254p]</a><br>A young child, just a year old, had a lump on his neck, arms stretched out, asking for medicine to dispel toxins. I believed this to be related to dryness of liver blood, as he had previously suffered from convulsions and had taken medicine like realgar. I therefore provided him with Liuwei Dihuang Wan to nourish his liver blood, and after several doses, he recovered.</p>
<p>Another child had a lump on the side of his neck, with excessive phlegm causing convulsions, and he took a medicinal formula that dries up phlegm, resulting in cramps in his hands and feet. This was a sign of renewed injury to the liver blood, indicating an urgent convulsion. I thus used a modified Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Gua Lou, Gardenia, Chuanxiong, and Donggui, and after adding Wuwei and Maidong to Liuwei Wan, he recovered.</p>
<p>A child every time frightened would have a lump on his neck, fever, decreased appetite, and slight twitches in his limbs while sleeping; this indicated that the liver wood was harming the spleen earth. I used Wuwei Yigong San with added Chaihu, Shengma, and Gua Lou which led to recovery. After the marriage, he developed lumps between his legs and arms after mistakenly using qi-moving and blood-breaking medicine, resulting in cramps and emaciation, resembling tuberculosis. I examined the situation upon arrival in the capital, used Dihuang Wan to nourish liver and kidney blood, and supplemented with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to replenish spleen and lung qi, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A child had lumps in front of and behind his ears; upon being startled would produce excessive phlegm, grind his teeth, and have convulsions, shaking his head. He took a drying medicine, which led to chronic fright and eventual death.</p>
<p>A child with smallpox healed as expected, but the scars were red like ochre. I believed the wet nurse had heat in her body. Upon examination, there was indeed stagnation of liver and spleen fire. I first used a modified Xiaoyao San in four doses, administered to the mother, with the child drinking a little, and they both recovered.<a id="trans-255p" href="#orig-255p" class="marker">[255p]</a><br>A young child has red and painful pockmarks, experiences heat and thirst and prefers cold, with difficulty in bowel movements. First, administer a decoction of Qianhu and Zhike to relieve thirst and facilitate bowel movements; then use Shengji Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction for stabilization; finally, apply celery juice for improvement.</p>
<p>A sixteen-year-old child has white pockmarks. Use several pounds of Dushen Decoction, and the color gradually returns to normal; additionally, use Rehmannia Pills and a Great Tonifying Decoction for stabilization.</p>
<p>A child has a sore throat with strong heat, red pockmarks, and slightly warm hands. This indicates lingering toxicity. Use Chaihu and Mai Dong Powder for stabilization. After seven days, there is renewed heat; initially, the fingers feel warm to the touch, but upon prolonged contact, they feel cold. This indicates spleen deficiency. Use Wuwu Yigong Powder for recovery.</p>
<p>A child has swelling and pain in the throat, with signs of fright and thirst; medications for dispelling fright and reducing fire only worsen the condition, and there is still a desire to expel phlegm and wind. I say: fright and thirst indicate a deficiency in the heart. The stomach is the root of the five organs; first, use Wuwu Yigong Powder to nourish the stomach, adding Platycodon and Licorice to eliminate toxins, thereby alleviating all symptoms. Later, administer Burdock Seed Decoction with Chaihu for recovery.</p>
<p>A child has a fever, prefers cold drinks, has yellow stools, and heat in both hands and feet, unable to suckle. Upon inspection, there are no visible issues in the mouth, but palpating the throat causes crying. This sore throat is due to excess heat in the spleen and stomach. Administer one dose each of Xiahuang and Qingwei Powders, to be taken by both mother and child for recovery. Later, due to the wet nurse consuming alcohol, the child becomes restless, and the previous two powders are administered again for recovery.<a id="trans-256p" href="#orig-256p" class="marker">[256p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　翻花疮之证，由疮疡溃后，风寒袭于患处，或肝火血燥生风，或乳母肝火生风，必致疮口努肉，突出如菌，或如指大小，长短不同。如风邪承袭者，先用补中益气汤加防风、天麻。风寒凝滞者，先用十宣散加羌活、天麻。儿肝火生风者，先用加味逍遥散加天麻、羌活。母肝火生风者，先用加味小柴胡汤，次用加味逍遥散加漏芦、天麻。其风邪所乘，外用豆豉饼；风寒所凝，外用熨葱法。更用太乙膏护疮口；突肉不消，更以黎芦膏涂之。如疮口不敛而恶寒发热者，元气虚也，用补中益气汤。晡热内热者，气血俱虚也，用八珍汤，倍加参、芪。食少难化者，脾气虚也，用五味异功散。若饮食少思，大便不调，或肌肉消瘦，小便澄白者，此兼肝脾疳证也，用九味芦荟丸以清肝火，用五味异功散以补脾气，外仍用熨治之法。<a id="orig-86p" href="#trans-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>　　　　　多骨疽</p>
<p>　　多骨疽，由疮疡久溃，脾胃损亏，血气不能荣于患处，邪气陷袭，久则筋烂骨腐，故骨脱出，非禀胎所有也。当补脾胃，壮元气，内用大补汤地黄丸，外以附子饼、葱熨法，祛散寒邪，补接元气，则骨自脱，疮自敛。若用克伐之剂，复伤真气，鲜有不危。婴儿患此，当调补乳母，外用葱熨，以岁月除之，尤不可用追蚀之药。<br>　　　　　漏疮</p>
<p>　　漏疮之证，因禀气血不足，或久病血气虚弱，或儿肝脾食积内热，不能生肌，或乳母七情不和。脾气不能收敛，当审其所因，调补元气，佐以如圣饼、葱熨之类为善。若用流气破血追蚀等药，反为败证矣。余当参各门主之。<a id="orig-87p" href="#trans-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>　　　　方</p>

<p><strong>Dan Liu (Red Bumps)</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of Dan Liu are caused by heat toxins invading the pores, clashing with qi and blood, and manifesting on the skin. One should apply Baiyu San (White Jade Powder). </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The aforementioned symptoms may be due to congenital toxins, clashes of wind and heat, frequent baths in hot water, frequent contact with warm clothing, food injuries leading to fever, or a wet and rich diet from the wet nurse. Emotional stress can also generate heat. The red, moving lesions are blood driven by wind and heat. If it is due to congenital toxins, use Hua Du Dan (Detoxification Pill); for wind-heat, use Bai Du San (Dispelling Toxins Powder); for frequent baths and warm clothing, use Si Wu Decoction, Lian Qiao (Forsythia), and Shan Zhi Zi (Gardenia); for food-related fevers, use Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction), Chai Hu (Bupleurum), and Shen Qu (Malt); if the wet nurse eats rich foods, add Qing Wei San (Clearing the Stomach Powder); if the wet nurse has stagnant heat, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San (Modified Happy Wanderer Powder). All should include Lou Lu (Reed) for both mother and child to take. Baiyu San has a very cold nature and can relieve heat toxins; it is suitable for lighter toxicity appearing on the limbs. If the condition extends to the chest, back, and abdomen, it is serious and requires Huo Ming Yin (Reviving Life Drink); one must encourage the patient to exert effort to expel toxic blood concentrated in one area. If the abdomen is distended and there is difficulty with urination and defecation, toxins have entered internally, and Da Lian Qiao Yin (Major Forsythia Drink) may also produce recovery.</strong> </p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a child suffers from this red rash, it is due to toxins accumulated from the mother’s womb, hence it manifests on the skin and varies in location. If it arises from the abdomen and spreads to the limbs, it is mild; if it starts from the limbs and collects in the abdomen, it is severe. Urgent treatment can save the child. The child’s red rash is indeed caused by accumulated heat, known as fetal toxins. </p>
<p>This may occur when the mother during pregnancy indulges in spicy and toxic foods, bathes in hot water, or uses charcoal in winter, causing heat to enter the womb due to excessive desires. Sometimes, the child is born into a heated environment, either from warm bedding or heated clothing, leading to an offensive heat and toxin attacking from within and without. Around six months of age, all children show symptoms. </p>
<p>At first, there is a fever; upon inspection, the skin appears red, and the child cries incessantly, the rash seeming to shift locations. Rashes on the limbs are survivable, while those on the waist and abdomen predict danger. Urgently use a special magnet or needle to draw out the toxic blood from below upwards, allowing the poisoned blood to flow out. Do not apply the needle in reverse; instead, use powdered frankincense, mixing it with egg white for a uniform paste to apply where needed, and occasionally use juice from banana roots for application. </p>
<p>Internally, take a detoxifying pill made with vermilion, mixing it with honey, and subsequently take a drink made from water-ground gold bars. </p>
<p>If the rash appears on the head, how should one treat it? The child must sleep on a bed with one end raised using bricks, allowing the toxic vapors to flow out from the head. Use magnetic needles to expel both the toxic gases and blood from the crown. If a wet nurse holds the child while applying needles, the toxins will descend, possibly obstructing the throat, making survival difficult. </p>
<p>Careful observation of fellow practitioners shows many fail in their techniques and cause harm to children. Hence, I do not shy away from reiterating these details and additionally provide ten formulas for detoxification.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Feizao Dan</strong>: It begins with swelling from the crown of the head, gradually becoming red and swollen, with swelling in the neck and red eyes. Take a bundle of fresh green onions, crush it to extract the juice, and apply it to the affected area. Another remedy involves mixing five taels of (shibu) saltpeter and two taels of realgar powder, then combining it with banana juice. Use a broken brush to apply the mixture, ensuring the patient lies down so that the juice seeps from below to the crown, allowing the poison to exit through the Baihui point. If applied incorrectly from below, the toxic vapors could invade the throat, making it difficult to treat.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Jizhao Dan</strong>: It presents as swelling and pain on the forehead. Apply a paste made of red adzuki bean powder mixed with egg white. This previous remedy is also effective.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Matters of Filial Piety in Confucianism</strong><br><strong>By Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Second Degree Fire</strong></p>
<p>In the case of children suffering from ailments such as sores, hives, and pox, especially during a time when fire energies are predominant or when the wandering star brings chaos, one should not hastily use Shengma Decoction to resolve them. Shengma Decoction possesses a spicy and warm flavor. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that heat is produced by accumulated warmth, which is termed heavy fire; it should only be treated with cooling herbs that are spicy in nature. If encountered at normal times, spicy warmth may be applied, as there is usually no urgent issue.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to carefully examine the state of the illness; in severe cases, spicy warmth is also unsuitable. After a dispersal, one should use Liangge Powder combined with Angelica and Baihu Decoction, or Huadan Decoction, or Yulu Powder for decoction. For even more severe cases, detoxifying decoctions and regulating stomach powders should be applied. The ancients said: &quot;Rashes and sores, both at the beginning and end, should not be purged,&quot; which is erroneous. Do we not know that pouring water to stop boiling is inferior to removing the firewood from beneath the pot? The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: “In the years of the fifth yin and the fifth shen, this illness occurs frequently, primarily due to the yang fire of Shaoyang.” Furthermore, it is noted that when Shaoyang&#39;s external energy prevails, hives and rashes manifest on the exterior. Additionally, all pain-related ailments and sores are attributed to heart fire. Wang Taifu further stated that all maladies stem from the heart. How can one rashly apply spicy warmth to disperse? If the heat intensifies, it may lead to internal toxins and blood loss, resulting in severe symptoms such as grinding teeth and convulsions; this indicates significant heat.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Like the white tiger combined with ginseng, and the Cooling the Diaphragm Powder added with Angelica and Platycodon, do not ask about autumn and winter; just see the sores and rashes, it works effectively. For children with sores, hives, grain rashes, red swellings, and blotch toxins, if there is internal poison leading to bleeding. The Inner Canon states: if the minor yang&#39;s guest qi prevails, then the red swellings and rashes appear externally. This is because residual heat has not been resolved, thus leading to internal poison and bleeding. Treat it with Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, White Tiger Decoction, and Cooling the Diaphragm Powder, selecting according to the clinical presentation. The so-called white tiger is traditionally said not to be used in autumn and winter, but that is a mistake. It can be used whenever there is this symptom, for it belongs to the fire of the corresponding organs.</p>
<p>For children with red swollen tumors with toxic heat spreading throughout the body, it indicates the poison of pathogenic heat. You can use magnet pieces to draw out the purple blood, and the illness will immediately improve. If it does not heal, later use Cooling the Diaphragm Powder combined with Rhubarb and Glauber&#39;s Salt for a good effect; next, use the Poison Cleansing Powder to wash out three to five times for guaranteed recovery. The classic says: red swellings and tumors of the fire color are governed by the fire of the corresponding organs.</p>
<p>For children with sudden red swellings, you can first use Niuhuang Tongge Wan to purge it, then apply Yangqishi San for the swelling and poison to dissipate by itself; if it does not, you can use a (Jinfei) needle to puncture, letting blood flow out to ensure recovery.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>For children with ulcers, scabies, or skin lesions, you can use a mixture of realgar powder with a little bit of mirabilite, mixed with oil for application.

<p><strong>Boils and Tumors</strong></p>
<p>When children experience red tumors and swellings that cause continuous pain, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states that all pains and itchy sores are due to heart fire, and a specific incantation can be used to suppress it. The method involves a mental focus, and the incantation goes as follows: &quot;Dragon spirits flow, all toxic swellings; sores with pus and blood are causing pain; forget the mind, recite the Great Compassion Mantra, and the toxins will dissipate.&quot; </p>
<p>Repeat the incantation three times, while facing the sun, moon, or a light source, take a breath, and blow it onto the swollen tumors. With the right hand, make a gentle gathering and compressing motion over the sores three times, while keeping the left hand still. Each breath should be followed by three gentle gathers and compresses, with no taboos to worry about. When using this method, ensure your mind is focused. This method comes from my ancestor, Han, and has been passed down for over a hundred years, successfully helping countless people. If the patient does not consume meat or alcohol, the method becomes even more effective. Those suffering from sores and swellings should avoid warm and moving foods like chicken, pork, fish, and rabbit. This method should not be treated lightly; it can be applied where no medicines are available.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Red Sores</strong></p>
<p>Red sores should be treated with fresh rehmannia, mutong, and the bitter herbs such as dogbane, along with balsam oil applied to the affected area. Children often suffer from stasis of the heart qi leading to sores and abscesses, which result from excessive intake while in the womb. This is a principle that must be addressed. Children, before they are able to see or think, have no means to feel such stasis in their hearts. Ancient sages stated that infants often have much dampness and heat due to prenatal excess; also, when the fetus is being formed, the parents’ qi and blood may be imbalanced in cold and heat, leading to numerous illnesses in their offspring. In particular, as their bodies are not yet sturdy and their membranes are delicate, any slight disturbance should be addressed rigorously. </p>
<p>I once saw a person who had suffered from long-term cough illness. After recovery, he had a son who, at three months old, developed a fever and a boil appeared under the right armpit between the yangming and shaoyang areas. As this abscess healed, another one formed under the left armpit, oozing pus and blood with no signs of recovery. The physician Wang Shoufu treated him with Siwu Decoction and Baidu San, adding ginseng, using xiangfu to assist and rhinoceros horn as the main ingredient, feeding the mother for two months, after which the child was stable. </p>
<p>After three months, he suddenly developed abdominal swelling and a red rash resembling clouds. Juices from cut grass were mixed with silkworm droppings and applied to it, leading to gradual disappearance. Half a month later, the swelling moved into the capsule, becoming a lump that looked concerning. After two days, the capsule burst, revealing two masses that discharged clear fluid. Using perilla leaves to hold fine charcoal powder, it took about ten days for the condition to heal. It must be understood that the prolonged illness of the father likely caused the mother to have worries and anger, exacerbating the remaining heat and toxins from the cough, leading to this situation. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Eyebrow Refinement</strong></p>
<p>The refinement of the eyebrow in children is called eyebrow refinement on the face, it is referred to as zjier in the ears, and as shoe itch in the feet. These three names are all erroneous. The <em>Inner Canon</em> states that all pain, itch, sores, and ulcers are attributed to the heart fire; it is the result of excessive heat from the heart fire. One can use a (non-metal) needle to prick it and cause bleeding; if it does not heal with one prick, it must be pricked again, as a second prick will surely lead to healing. The <em>Inner Canon</em> states that when there is excess blood, it should be drained. To drain means to break the blood. For eyebrow refinement, one must not apply medication externally. If the sores are very itchy, it will lead to scratching; if the medicine enters the eye, it will surely cause damage.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Poison</strong></p>
<p>Children with red dan poison, although there are ten types, are all caused by the internal exuberance of heart fire, where heat collides with blood. It may arise from the hands and feet or manifest on the head, face, chest, and back, wandering up and down. Its heat is like fire, with pain that is indescribable, and red like cinnabar, hence it is named dan poison. If it emerges from the abdomen to the limbs, it is easy to treat; if it goes from the limbs into the abdomen, it is difficult to treat. The method to treat this condition must first use exterior medications to resolve heat poison before applying topical treatments. If medications are applied hastily, causing the qi to be trapped without release, they might harm the internal organs. Dan poison in children is easy to treat for those over one year old, but difficult for those under one year old. The ten types of dan tumors in children are: 1. Flying stove dan, 2. Walking stove dan, 3. Ghost fire dan, 4. Heavenly fire dan, 5. Heavenly escape dan, 6. Water dan, 7. Gourd dan, 8. Wild fire dan, 9. Smoke fire dan, 10.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Children suffering from red rashes and dan disease may originate from ten causes. It is all due to excessive heat in the heart, fluctuating up and down. Its color is murky like cinnabar, hence the name “dan disease.” The treatment methods are clearly laid out in medical texts, depending on the practitioner&#39;s understanding.</p>
<p>In children, dan is the most toxic, manifesting differently in ten forms. From above to below, it may not reach the chest; from below to the kidneys, it can cause great distress. Within half a cycle, it should not be seen; a full cycle indicates the need for intervention. The use of qīzhēn (a kind of needle) is effective both internally and externally.</p>
<p>For internal relief, one uses red peony, qinghao, and protective wind herbs. Sheng ma, licorice, and rehmannia are combined, while bamboo leaves and original ginseng are boiled for use. Externally, Yiyuan is pasted on, and cold water is similarly employed. Within three to five days, urgent measures should be taken, for surprises may arise akin to dreams.</p>
<p>The treatment of dan follows a certain order, starting from the head and laying out each step. Dissolving the exterior and using detoxifying agents comes first, followed by inserting qīzhēn. If qīzhēn is inconvenient, one should urgently use acupuncture needles. Then apply medicinal ointments to save the child, a method established by predecessors.</p>
<p>The swift method requires detoxification first, or employing purgative medicines to relieve blockage. At the onset, do not aggressively attack; poisons lurking within must be expelled. The treasure of detoxification is unparalleled, along with decoctions of protective wind and sheng ma. Effective medicinal substances possess divine power, depending entirely on the skill of the healer.</p>
<p>Experienced methods for treating dan are now shared for future generations. First, cleanse and purify the sick body, then apply soothing treatments. Bashed field snails can be prepared for application, or water can be mixed with heating methods. Moreover, use nansheng and rhubarb in moderation, with mang xiao ground and soaked in water.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Fetal Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>Fetal toxicity refers to the fiery poison within the essence and blood, specifically the poison of the Fire of the Vital Gate. The Vital Gate is where men store their essence and women maintain their womb. Observing the discussions by Dongyuan on red tumors and Danxi on fetal toxicity, the treatment methods can be discerned. Ancient formulas exist for detoxification, such as the Huanglian Gancao method, and there are also elixirs for nurturing infants and detoxification, which are both good methods. </p>
<p>I have recently established a new formula using Danxi&#39;s Sanbu Pill recipe, with Qinxian, Huanglian, and Hainang half-cooked and stir-fried in half wine, and Gancao half-cooked and half-roasted, each blended into powder in equal portions. Forming them into pills the size of sesame seeds with a coating of vermilion and realgar, I named it the Shengshu Jiedu Pill. Administering this to children daily is beneficial.</p>
<p>Those born with fetal toxicity exhibit issues such as scabies, moist sores, abscesses, hard lumps, heavy or aberrant tongues, and oral sores, as well as feelings of heat or cold, jaundice, and fright associated with fetal conditions. Many newborns are afflicted by fetal toxicity-related ailments. For instance, issues such as umbilical wind or stubborn phlegm coughs can be difficult to treat; if a child has true convulsions at six months, that is ominous, while those with sores before a week are likely to die. Moreover, newborns have delicate stomachs and intestines, their blood and qi are insufficient, making it hard to introduce herbs or stones, and their defenses are weak with underdeveloped meridians, making acupuncture challenging. Practitioners should exercise caution!</p>
<p>When asked about the concept of fetal toxicity, I replied: the wise have discussed it thoroughly. After all, humans are born in a state of tranquility, which is the essence of nature. They are stirred by stimuli, which is the nature of the fetus. Desire is akin to fire.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

The fire of the five desires lies hidden within the maternal blood, and this is poison. In the act of sexual union, when the essence凝结, poison is also attached, which is the origin of the fetal poison. It is said that when a child is in the mother&#39;s womb, if hungry, it consumes the mother’s blood, and if thirsty, it drinks the mother’s blood. Once it breaks free from the womb, if there is residual blood in its mouth that is not cleaned properly and is swallowed into the belly, this is called fetal poison. Such words, once proposed by one person, are echoed by many, and none have sought to argue against them, which shows the unreliability of this text.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Although it is said that men store essence and women bind the womb, there is hidden fire in the gate of life of parents. At the beginning of the embryo, the child receives this fire. After birth, this fire must manifest as abscesses, sores, rashes, scabies, and all kinds of vicious sores, which are termed &quot;fetal poison.&quot; The ancients established laws for newborns, including methods to cleanse the mouth and formulas of yellow root, licorice, and vermilion honey, all devised to detoxify. Later generations combined these three methods, using the umbilical cord and medicines, naming it &quot;Infant Nurturing Longevity Detoxification Pill.&quot;</p>

<p>Red tumors in children, the most severe fetal poison, are the red fibrous tumors, also known as &quot;dragon binding fire belt,&quot; a dire disease in children. Those above two years can be treated; those under a year or half a year are difficult to cure, with very few exceptions.

<p><strong>Dan Poison</strong></p>
<p>When a child experiences spasms due to Dan Poison, the illness is located in the Shaoyang, and the Shaoyang pertains to the fire of the gallbladder. If spasms occur before the appearance of Dan tumors, this indicates that the toxic fire is emanating from within and can be treated. Conversely, if the tumors appear before the spasms, the poison has entered from the outside and is fatal. For those where the poison is from within, which is a residual fire, it is advisable to disperse and detoxify by using methods such as Feng Tong Sheng San, or employing a modified version of Sheng Ma Ge Gen Decoction.</p>
<p>For sores and abscesses causing spasms, this indicates prenatal poison. Infants may develop parasitic skin conditions, causing itching and pain, not knowing what medication to use. Internal detoxifying medicine and external applications of arsenious sulfur drugs may lead to a quick relief of sores, or in some cases, the sores may resolve without application. Signs of abdominal distension and constipation, lack of blood color in the skin, and inability to open the eyes while having spasms indicate a severe condition, necessitating urgent detoxifying medicine. The emergence of sores is necessary; failure to do so, coupled with difficulty breathing, leads to death. The main remedy is Xiong Huang Detoxicating Pill.</p>
<p>For infants under one year of age, regardless of whether it is sores, abscesses, or Dan tumors, if spasms occur, it is all difficult to treat, as their spleen and stomach are delicate, their digestive qi is not yet fully developed, making it hard to administer medicinal attacks.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Scabies and Eruptive Skin Conditions</strong> </p>
<p>In cases of dry scabies, treatment is possible with sesame seed pills as the main remedy. However, if the condition has become soaked and ulcerated, with no intact skin and the child crying day and night, treatment should not be attempted. It is absolutely forbidden to use arsenic, sulfur powder, or mercury as topical medications, as these toxic substances can enter the body through weakened areas and cause convulsions and difficulty breathing, leading to death. For children suffering from sores and scabies, it is advisable to use detoxification soup derived from the mother&#39;s milk as the main remedy. </p>
<p><strong>Erythema and Edema</strong> </p>
<p>Zhong Yang said: The heat and toxic energy become trapped in the pores, clash with the blood, and present as red spots on the skin. This results from the combination of heat toxins and blood, which allows wind energy to invade, causing red, swollen, and migrating rashes over the body. This condition often occurs when the wet nurse excessively consumes alcohol or fried foods, and when clothing is put on the child without allowing it to cool down. The rash may appear on the head, face, chest, or back, making the child irritable, bloated, and feeling like fire, causing indescribable pain. If it enters the abdomen or kidneys, the situation becomes irreparable. Additionally, within the first week of a child&#39;s life, their skin, muscles, bones, and internal organs are not yet firm; they are tender and weak, resembling the sprouting of grass and trees, unexposed to the elements. Thus, the newborn is referred to as a &quot;bud.&quot; During this first week, frequent bathing should be avoided, as it may cause the accumulation of damp heat that cannot easily dissipate.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

There are also various types of boils, which may start as spots and later expose bone; the smaller ones are like millet or beans, while the more severe ones resemble plums or lichis, with colors ranging from red to black, green to white, changing frequently. They may appear in the mouth, around the navel, or on the arms and buttocks, without any specific location, often seen between the fingers. The roots penetrate deeply into the flesh, spreading in the arms and causing swelling, with toxic blood flowing through the tendons, leading to decaying flesh and exposed bones, resulting in excessive bleeding. This can drive individuals to madness, causing irritability, restlessness, and discomfort, all due to toxic energy attacking the heart. Applying powdered southern star, pinellia, and white atractylodes is advised. It is best to wash the area before applying the medicine.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Malignant Neoplasm</h3>
<p>Chao said: A malignant neoplasm in children occurs when wind, heat, and toxic energy clash with blood energy, leading to the formation of stubborn knots that manifest in the neck. If exposed to wind and cold, they do not dissipate but turn into lymphatic nodes, which eventually ulcerate and become sores. For this condition, it is advisable to take cooling herbal decoctions such as Qingliang Yinzi and Shengma Decoction. There are various effective formulas for treating malignant neoplasms according to Tang&#39;s methods. Qianjin Lianqiao Pill and Longdan Decoction can both be taken.</p>
<h3>Rashes</h3>
<p>Rashes have two types: those caused by warm toxins and those resulting from gastric decay. The rashes due to warm toxins happen during warm winter months when individuals are exposed to an adverse atmosphere. If not immediately manifested as illness, they may be triggered in the spring by accumulated cold, preventing the release of toxic energy. As the weather warms, these warm toxins manifest, causing the muscles to rot and resulting in rashes resembling brocade patterns. The appropriate treatments include Ge Gen and Ju Pi Decoctions, and Huang Lian and Ju Pi Decoctions as primary remedies. </p>
<p>On the other hand, rashes resulting from gastric decay may appear before or shortly after an attack of illness. This is due to improper purging, allowing heat to invade the stomach; when purging is needed but not done, gastric heat fails to dissipate, resulting in rashes. In such cases, surface medicines should not be used, as the surface is weak while the interior is strong. If sweating is induced, it could aggravate the problem and worsen the rashes due to the surface weakness. The recommended treatments include Hei Shen Shengma Decoction and Huaban Decoction. </p>
<p>Rashes from a febrile illness indicate that heat is within the organs, attacking the intestines and stomach, resulting in internal sores before appearing externally. Red rashes are easier to treat, while black rashes are harder, due to the deeper invasion of toxic energy into the stomach. Qiang Huo Powder with Ciban is also suitable for treating rashes.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Skin Sores and Itches</strong></p>
<p>Tang states: When children are affected by dampness, stagnation of blood and qi can lead to sores. This often arises from parents and wet nurses not maintaining cleanliness, infrequent changing and washing of clothing and bedding, or neglecting to wash urine and feces for several days, which can also cause sores to develop. In mild weather, frequent bathing and changing of clothes, referred to as external cleansing, is sufficient, and there is no need for medicine. If a child must resort to medication, this is the last resort. Proper nurturing can prevent any ailment. Additionally, feeding should be regulated to avoid over-filling; the child&#39;s body should be like a well-cared-for plant, which is the principle of nourishment. </p>
<p>For bathing methods: in spring, use willow twigs and schizonepeta; in summer, use jujube leaves and locust branches; in autumn and winter, use bitter bush. Frequent bathing keeps the body comfortable, ensuring external cleansing and preventing illness. Jin Hua powder and other prescriptions for sores and itches may also be applied. Applying Mo Feng ointment to sores and itches is highly effective, alongside taking Qiang Huo powder with additions of Fang Feng and Schizonepeta, as well as recipes like Da Lian Qiao drink and Sheng Ma decoction.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　　Childhood Residual Toxicity and Ulcerative Spots</p>
<p>Residual toxicity refers to the remnants received in utero before birth. This occurs when parents suffer from conditions like yang mei sores, leaving behind lingering toxins that affect the essence and blood during conception. After birth, if the child is bathed in hot water and heated clothing is applied, the external heat will provoke the internal toxins to surface on the skin. Initially, red dots appear, followed by ulcerative spots; in severe cases, the corners of the mouth, genital area, eyes, and facial skin might all deteriorate, hindering breastfeeding and causing restlessness and crying. Early treatment is essential; administer a mixture of tu fu ling (smilax) powder and yellow essence in the mouth several times a day, about four to five portions. Externally apply the detoxifying Zi Jin Dan (Purple Gold Powder) to the affected areas. Those that respond effectively may have a survival rate of three or four out of ten; however, if treatment is delayed and the toxic condition worsens with widespread ulcerations, the chance of survival may drop to one or two out of a hundred. This is due to the depth of the toxin&#39;s roots.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Childhood Scarlet Fever</strong></p>
<p>Scarlet fever is contracted before birth, but symptoms appear after birth. While in the womb, a child relies on the father&#39;s essence and the mother&#39;s blood for nourishment. If the parents cannot control their desires, excessive heat can harm the fetus; moreover, they cannot avoid rich flavors or the warmth from coal and heavy bedding, which often causes heat to accumulate in the child. Once born, bathing in hot water, exposure to heated clothing, and the activation of internal toxins can trigger the disease. </p>
<p>When symptoms arise, the child first experiences fever, crying, and spasms; next, rashes appear that are red, swollen, bright, and hot, often moving quickly and unpredictably. If the rash starts on the forehead, it is named &quot;Heavenly Covering Powder,&quot; to be treated with a decoction of Rhubarb and Kudzu that both mother and child should consume. If the rash begins from the belly and back, spreading to the limbs, it is mild; if it originates in the limbs and spreads to the chest and belly, it is severe. </p>
<p>The treatment focuses initially on blood-letting to remove toxic blood. After blood-letting, slices of fatty pork should be placed on the affected area for a while, and then replaced with a golden powder mixed with juice from water banana roots. For severe cases, this should be changed twice a day. Internally, one can use a decoction of Lonicera japonica, a detoxifying mixture with rhinoceros horn, or a five-fruit detoxification pill. If toxicity leads to a hard, swollen belly without milk production, one should administer “Purple Snow Powder.” </p>
<p>Three days later, if the body gradually cools, the area where blood was drawn becomes soft and active, with clear sounds and normal milk production, then the recovery is on track; otherwise, it may be a sign of deterioration.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Sores and Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>The treatment for furuncles and abscesses is detailed in &quot;Standards for Ulcer Medicine.&quot; In children, although their bodies are weak and delicate, their nature is still innocent, and they rarely experience the five toxins or the diagnoses of the five excesses and seven deficiencies. Before and shortly after birth, sores may appear all over the body, and treatment is often avoided. Other small boils can be treated with topical applications for resolution. However, if there is excessive cold or heat, causing distress and harming the heart and abdomen, one must seek the underlying cause for treatment. For infants under breast care, both mother and child should receive treatment, and it is essential for the physician to possess insight and clarity, rather than simply following dogmatic methods. Xue has focused on the significant aspects of treating furuncles and abscesses, adding in childcare, which is akin to adding branches to a trunk.

<p>Skin ulcers arise from imbalances in the internal organs, with blocked meridians leading to their formation. They may result from congenital toxins, or from wind transforming into parasites, or from excess heat, or from shock entering the skin. The most severe cases involve stagnation in the blood vessels, manifesting as lesions on the skin. If one restricts the flow of vital energy and blood, it can easily rupture; if it becomes entangled in wind, it leads to severe itching; or if external pathogens enter, it often causes widespread itching without resolution. Food toxins can stagnate and impair the blood and vital energy, eventually transforming into pus over time. Shock-induced ulcers derive from a mental disturbance with no tangible cause, causing a blockage of blood and energy in the organs, leading to skin eruptions that spread throughout the body, particularly affecting the limbs. Wind ulcers, also widespread and characterized by very small forms, are commonly referred to as scabs and heat toxins, emerging unpredictably as blood stagnates, resulting in lesions.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Inner Canon states that all pains, itching, sores, and lesions relate to heart fire. The internal fire becomes stagnant, leading to such diseases. The heart governs the blood; when the blood becomes hot, it generates wind. Severe internal heat leads to a cycle of transmission, causing fire to generate earth, while blood fills the Yangming channel, which controls inner wind heat and the conflict of heat in the blood; thus, various skin manifestations occur. When it appears yellow and purulent, it signifies the earth generating metal, the mother returning to the child. Initially, it presents mild itching and slight heat; when swelling, pain, and ulceration occur, it indicates extreme heat causing blood to congeal and transform into fluid, resulting in stagnation that turns into pus.

If there is thirst and constipation, it indicates internal heat and toxin; one should use the Four Shun Cooling Drink, supplemented with the Sacred Cake. If the swelling is hard and red, indicating a gathering of heat and toxin, one should use the Life-Preserving Drink, supplemented with garlic moxibustion. If the swelling is hot and fails to subside, threatening to form pus, use the Tuo Li Xiao Du Powder; if pus does not form or if it does form but does not rupture, indicating stagnation of qi and blood, use the Eight Treasures Decoction. If there is an opening and the flesh is red and does not heal, indicating spleen blood deficiency, use the Four Substances, ginseng, and atractylodes. If the flesh is white and does not heal, indicating spleen qi weakness, use the Four Gentlemen, chuanxiong, and angelica. If there is reduced appetite and fatigue with non-healing, indicating spleen qi deficiency, use the Six Gentlemen, angelica, and drinks of elevating herbs. Generally, with proper medication matched to the symptoms, there is nothing that cannot be cured. If one rashly attacks the toxin, resulting in a loss of vital energy, it will lead to severe conditions that are difficult to treat. In general, sores related to the bowels are easier to treat; if there is no loss of vital energy, they can heal on their own. Those associated with the organs are more difficult to treat, and if there is a loss of vital energy, they may transform into severe conditions. Misusing aggressive treatments leads to a loss of vital energy, making healing even harder; thus, it is crucial to avoid using harsh medications. Observing the teachings of Dongyuan and Danxi: when swelling and pain appear, along with signs of weak pulses, one must administer tonics; if blood and qi are not deficient, healing can be assured; however, if one uses methods to expel the evil toxins, one may inevitably encounter the dangers of deficiency.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

<p>In &quot;The Treasure Mirror for Infants,&quot; the song about children&#39;s dandruff says: When the fire of red is first begun, it seems like burning flames, the heavenly fire turning the body red. The fire from the edges is dark bluish, with symptoms sprouting from the forehead. The hips along the groin area burn with dandruff, resembling a red band in fiery spurts. When the fire is strong, it reaches its peak in a day, changing unpredictably among five colors. The home fire connects to the cheeks and both armpits, while the heavenly oven affects the ankles and the lower body. The back and knees present with a red flying dandruff, and the groin&#39;s navel area invites the urinary discharge.</p>
<p>Cao Shi says: The signs of fiery dandruff come and go like a febrile illness, reddening the body and gradually increasing. He further states: The appearance of fiery dandruff is red like it is burning, with rapid bursts of eruptions. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The heart governs the blood and has a fiery nature. When the blood becomes hot and clashes, and yin becomes stagnant in yang, this results in the onset of toxic rash. When the heart is deficient and cold, there is itching; when the heart is full and hot, there is pain. First, use Bai Jie San to release the exterior, then take Dang Gui San with Lian Qiao and Jing Jie&#39;s decoction, along with Niu Bang Tang mixed with fried flaxseed, to help clear heat and expel toxins. Following that, Chi Ge San may be used, or initially, Hua Dan Tang is also suitable.</p>
<p>In cases where there are rashes on the body, the symptoms are similar to those described earlier, not excessively dry or itchy, but presenting as raised spots over the body, along with a state of dizziness and discomfort, known as yin toxic symptoms. First, use Chong He Yin with Nan Mu Xiang, ginger, and water to decoct and take; next, apply Dang Gui San and Xiong Huang San. Both of these symptoms do not discriminate between red and white; if it enters the abdomen or kidneys, it can cause significant harm and should not be treated lightly, as it could bring distress.</p>
<p>Generally, while there are various forms of toxic rash, the source of the illness is singular. For those with red rashes covering the body that itch, especially among young girls aged fifteen or sixteen whose menstrual flow has not yet started, rashes may develop due to wind-toxic blood; it is advisable to take Fang Ji San. </p>

<p>The eruption of fetal toxin occurs when the toxin lies hidden within. This can be caused by frequent baths in hot water, wearing heated clothing, or the nursing mother’s diet influenced by emotions, which generate internal heat, exacerbating the condition. It manifests on the head, face, and limbs, spreading to the chest and abdomen, with a red color that moves unpredictably. The ancients said: Those who experience onset from the limbs into the abdomen are all difficult to treat. One should urgently have the afflicted suck the toxic blood from the affected areas, gathering it in one place to be needled out, and then immediately take a lifesaving decoction. However, avoid needling within the hundred days, as the muscles are fragile at that time. If the eruption is caused by excessive dispersing treatments, resulting in superficial heat that does not subside, use the Bai Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Fang Feng and Bai Zhi; if it is caused by excess cooling, with injured stomach Qi and persistent heat, use the Yi Gong San with added Chai Hu and Sheng Ma; or if there are concurrent symptoms of spasms, use Si Jun, Sheng Ma, Dang Gui, and Diaoteng Gou.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Harm from Food Leading to Rashes</strong></p>
<p>Harm from food leading to rashes occurs when the energy of the spleen and stomach is fully engaged, yet an excess of dairy and food cannot be transformed, causing heat to accumulate inside and surface on the skin. If food stagnation from dairy persists, first use Baohuan pills to disperse it; if there is constipation, increase the dosage of Da Huang to facilitate bowel movements. Once food is digested but rashes continue to appear, treat it with Qingzhong Jieyu Decoction; if the rashes persist and there is no desire for food after the heat is removed, use Wuwei Yigong Powder to nourish. If there is fever and thirst, or a reduced appetite, use Qiwwei Baizhu Powder to replenish. Generally, rashes caused by heavy or rich foods lead to a red halo that spreads slowly; however, if caused by drinking liquor or mistakenly swallowing foreign objects, the redness spreads quickly. There are also cases of sores with redness around them, where heat dissipates or pus discharges spontaneously. In all these cases, needling is to be avoided, and calming methods should be prioritized, with no aggressive treatments. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs, do not stop it, as these symptoms have a dispersing effect. For those who drink liquor, taking a cup or two of cold rice vinegar can be a miraculous remedy. In cases where mothers excessively consume roasted rich foods, drink liquor, or take spicy and drying medicines, or if liver and spleen are harmed by pent-up anger, leading to ailments in their children, one should treat it as a case of fetal heat and poisonous sores.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

<p>Within a hundred days of a baby&#39;s birth, particularly after six months, if the eyes appear red with slight swelling, the face shows a bluish-dark hue, and the baby cries restlessly at night, or if the face resembles rouge, this indicates inner heat. There are also instances where the face does not turn red. This initially stems from the mother experiencing a severe shock during pregnancy, which harms the fetus and transmits illness, manifesting outwardly. Initially, this conditions presents widely across the face in a manner resembling chickenpox, with slightly red feet that are not inflamed, exhibiting erratic patterns of rise and fall, and extending to the neck, bright red like vermilion, known as Jing Dan. It is treated with Four Sacred Powder; first, wash the eyes; then, boil Baijie Powder combined with Wuhuo Decoction, to alleviate the shock-induced heat and toxicity. Burdock soup, Angelica Powder, Sanjie Powder, and Huangqins&#39; Four Ingredients Decoction can also be used for treatment. If Jing Dan spreads to the chest and armpits leading to phlegm and wheezing, it is urgent to dispel heat and draw out toxins to prevent internal harm. Use Wuhuo Decoction with added Shengma and raw Rehmannia, boiled with ginger and the heart of lantern, to eliminate it; continue using the aforementioned medicines without causing other issues. Alternatively, administer Wan&#39;an Decoction.</p>
<p><strong>Wuse Dan</strong></p>
<p>The five-colored Dan in children arises from the changes in the Dan, manifesting inconsistently in colors like blue, yellow, white, black, and red. This is due to the heat from wind toxins, which can be intense or mild, hot or cold, leading to the occurrence of the five-colored Dan. The Kong family passes down a method of using Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, prepared according to regulations, with the residue applied on the Dan for effectiveness.</p>

<p>Red Dan is caused by the heaviness of wind toxicity, resulting in a red color. It initially appears as large as a coin or as small as a bean, with grains forming on the flesh, resembling the color of a chicken&#39;s comb, therefore also called Zhu Yu Dan.</p>

<p>Heavenly Fire Dan appears in children as red spots on the flesh, with the larger ones the size of a hand. In severe cases, the entire body may break out in red and itch, hence named Heavenly Fire Dan.</p>
<p>Red Flow refers to patches of red on a child&#39;s body that resemble rouge, and it spreads gradually; this is called Dan poison, commonly known as flow. If it arises from heat, the color will be red, and if from wind, it will be white; both conditions are swollen and fevers arise. One may use a scalpel to drain the bad blood. If the poison has not entered the abdomen, it can still be treated.</p>

<p>Children with weak muscles are affected by the invasion of wind, toxins, and heat. When heat and toxins attack the blood and qi, the skin becomes red and swollen. The wind moves restlessly with the qi; thus, it is named &quot;swelling that travels.&quot; </p>
<p>Moreover, the appearance of this traveling swelling includes shades of green, yellow, red, and white, with no fixed color, moving between the layers of the skin, and a slight glow on the flesh. </p>
<p>To treat this traveling swelling, take a piece of raw linen, dip it in oil, ignite it with fire, and hold it over the affected area while chanting: &quot;Day moves, day moves, not knowing the grease, fire burns your head!&quot; Repeat the incantation seven times, and it will heal.</p>
<p>It is also said: In extreme cold conditions, do not exceed the use of algae. However, if there is a heat-related swelling or toxin, take the algae from the water, finely chop it, cook it, and then mash it, applying it thickly—about three-tenths of an inch—over the affected area. Change it when it dries. </p>
<p>I believe this should not be applied directly; if the toxin is on the surface, it may be dealt with, but if suppressed, it will not be released, and may enter deeper.

<p>In newborn infants, the stored fetal heat may manifest as scarlet fever, which will first be observable externally, though people may not notice it. If a baby in swaddling shows excessive eye discharge without any apparent cause, this indicates a potential outbreak of scarlet fever. If there is also slight wheezing or rapid breathing, the toxic condition has worsened and is affecting the lungs. Upon noticing these signs, it is urgent to mix dragon&#39;s brain with water and give it to the child, or use medicines such as indigo root or rhinoceros horn to gradually eliminate the poison. If the body already shows red spots, then further external treatments with substances like mustard greens should be applied, following a gradual and systematic approach to treatment. In my family, both of my sons had thick eye discharge at birth and subsequently developed scarlet fever. There is also a case of a certain official&#39;s granddaughter, who at seven days old had abundant eye discharge, and later developed a small red spot like a coin in her lower abdomen, which gradually spread upward to the heart, leading to her death. This is crucial knowledge. Initially, it was believed that if scarlet fever developed within a hundred days, it would be fatal and untreatable; however, there are cases that can be treated and should not be neglected.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<p>Generally, when a child suffers from swelling and inflammation, even if the condition seems serious, one must not hastily use strong laxatives like Da Huang or Mang Xiao, for fear that toxins may invade the interior and take control, making treatment difficult. Instead, one should use mild, detoxifying herbs that regulate the internal organs, facilitating gentle movement and benefits. This approach protects the vital energy while expelling external pathogens, thereby ensuring overall well-being. There was a case of a half-year-old child with swelling, for whom a doctor improperly administered Qing Jin Dan, leading to excessive purging, retention of toxins internally, and resulting in wheezing, agitation, and death. Infants have delicate skin and are easily affected by both deficiency and excess, and they cannot tolerate many medications. Therefore, treatment must not be taken lightly, nor should one act impulsively; it all relies on meticulous care and attention to ensure safety. Many in the world do not know this, hence the need for thorough documentation and advice.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a young child has scarlet fever, one must anticipate that the condition may extend to the throat, neck, abdomen, and other vulnerable areas. One can apply ointment to protect those areas and use a needle to draw it towards the point of occurrence, allowing any bad blood to escape and relieve the toxicity. Some believe that it is necessary to scrape off the bad blood completely with a comb until clear, yellow fluid emerges, which is appropriate only for those with vigorous energy and hot blood. Generally, this illness varies in severity; older children with strong vital energy can endure it better, while infants under one month who contract it severely may not be suitable for this method. It is crucial to note that a child, two years old, named Zhang Kangdao, died two days after undergoing treatment with acupuncture that drew out toxic blood. It should not be ignored.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Boils are the most severe among all sores. They can be fatal quickly. The ancients say: there are twelve types of boils, each different; among them, thirty-six are critical, and once they reach their full count, they become incurable; there are also cases where one dies without reaching that count due to the dispersal of toxic gases. If the pox virus infects a person, appearing on the head and face or spreading all over the body, it is not of this type. In children, these often arise from the mother consuming toxic foods, the child accidentally ingesting poisonous substances, or being affected by improper seasonal climates, all of which can lead to this condition. These sores mostly appear on the head, face, and limbs, with varied shapes and colors; they may resemble small sores, blisters, be painful, itchy, or associated with numbness. External symptoms include chills and fever, vomiting, and nausea, with tightness in the limbs. The main approach is to determine if the pathogen is on the surface or internal, and promptly use the method of burning garlic as a moxibustion technique, along with detoxifying agents.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

If one consumes raw or cold substances, or if one is doused with cold water, the milder cases will struggle to recover, while the more severe cases will not be curable. Those affected in the legs often have red threads reaching the navel; those in the arms often have red threads reaching the heart; those within the lips and mouth often have red threads reaching the throat. Quickly use needles to extract the bad blood to release the poison, which can ensure safety. In remote areas where medicine is hard to reach, moxibustion has the power to revive; if harsh and drastic medicines are taken, it will only worsen the danger. Children’s muscles are delicate and they cannot express whether they feel pain, so when applying moxibustion, one must cut garlic into thin slices and place them on the skin, slightly hollowing out a space, then ignite the moxa on the garlic, first testing the heat on an adult&#39;s arm to ensure it is suitable, and then moving it to the sore; also prepare additional moxa in the same manner for testing before switching, without allowing pauses.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

Medicines can correspond to symptoms, resolving issues before they become serious or allowing existing problems to dissipate on their own. If pus forms but does not discharge, it indicates a deficiency of the vital essence, requiring nourishment and acupuncture to prevent toxic qi from attacking internally and blood qi from collapsing. If pus discharges but the pain worsens, it indicates a deficiency of qi and blood; use the Eight Treasure Decoction. If nausea occurs with reduced appetite, it indicates stomach qi deficiency; use the Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is a desire to vomit but no appetite, or if the abdomen feels bloated, it indicates spleen qi deficiency; use the Six Gentlemen Decoction. If there are severe muscle spasms and rigidity of the mouth, it indicates extreme deficiency of qi and blood leading to a change in symptoms; use the Ten Complete Great Supplement Decoction.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Wang Lan Chuang (King&#39;s Rot)</h3>
<p>When a child has heat in the internal organs, the heat affects the skin, and if dampness invades from the outside, sores will appear. If the heat is particularly strong, the sores will also manifest vigorously, initially appearing like small sesame seeds, and soon oozing large amounts of fluid, decaying as if burned by fire, hence named Wang Lan Chuang.</p>
<h3>Hong Si Chuang (Red Thread Sores)</h3>
<p>There is a type of sore known as Hong Si Chuang, which, although not a dan zhan (red sore), possesses a similar poison. It often appears on the knuckles of the middle fingers, more severely on the left for males and the right for females. Its appearance is that of a clear, shiny water bubble, about the size of a small chick&#39;s head, with dozens of tiny needle-like holes underneath, causing no itch or pain, posing no issue. The edge of the bubble has a red thread-like vein subtly visible beneath the skin, which moves very quickly; if it travels up to the elbow, it becomes dangerous, and if it reaches the heart, it can be fatal. For those with this symptom, urgent treatment involves puncturing the head of the sore with a needle or sealing it with chewed white plum, halting the movement of the thread.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Evil Kernels of Scrofula</strong></p>
<p>Scrofula, an ailment, was previously called &quot;Nine Leaks&quot; by ancient sages. Its cause appears to be heat, and its manifestations are varied, merely named according to their appearance. Generally, it begins between the muscles of the neck, and if not yet suppurated, it can be alleviated by drawing out the core, using acupuncture, moxibustion, or topical applications, tailored to the underlying cause. However, young children are too weak for needles and heat, so medicinal formulations for ingestion and topical application are used instead. This disease often arises behind the ears and on both sides of the neck, initially presenting as a single bump, which then usually proliferates into multiple bumps of various sizes, encircling the neck like a string of pearls. Each bump swells first and then suppurates. Mild cases can heal, while severe ones are difficult to treat. If the kernels leak pus for many years without drying up, it is referred to as &quot;Leaky Neck.&quot; The initial occurrence of the disease results from the three Yang patterns receiving wind and heat, which clash with blood and qi. Treatment involves a formulation like Bai Jie San combined with Dang Gui San, taken as a decoction with water, ginger, scallions, and lotus heart; followed by the use of Yuan Shen drink, Burdock soup, Mu Tong powder, and Nei Xiao pills to disperse heat and transform toxins; washing with Quercus powder, applying Bai Ji powder and Er Xiang powder to promote the movement of blood and qi. Once the pus has dried up and the essence is exhausted, healing will occur. Moreover, one should avoid consuming toxic wild foods to prevent recurrence. Heat-toxicity scrofula originates from the hand-foot Shaoyang and foot Jueyin meridians due to wind and heat, or may stem from liver abscesses and dietary accumulation. Symptoms manifest in the neck, armpits, or around the ears, resembling a string of pearls, and one must discern between exterior and interior conditions of deficiency and excess.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The convulsions caused by the wind are associated with the liver and gallbladder channels. The interaction of the wind and wood with fire shows that when wood is strong, it produces wind, leading to heat and dryness in the blood, which causes the condition of spasms and disturbances. This occurs because the wind increases the liver fire, which in turn consumes the liver blood. Insufficient blood fails to nourish the tendons, resulting in contractions and knots similar to pearls.</p>
<p>The sides of the neck are specifically related to the liver and gallbladder channels. Treatment should focus on nourishing kidney water, clearing liver fire, nurturing yin blood, and strengthening the spleen&#39;s earth aspect. When kidney water is abundant, liver fire naturally diminishes; when liver fire is cleared, yin blood is generated. The generation of yin blood calms the fire, and when the fire is calmed, it does not harm the original qi, preventing diseases from fire overpowering the earth.</p>
<p>Regarding congenital toxins causing scrofula, this arises from stagnation of liver and gallbladder fire. The liver and gallbladder channels travel along the side of the body, and if affected by liver fire, it manifests in that area. Therefore, one must carefully analyze the cause and apply the right medication. If it results from the anger of the wet nurse or from blood deficiency leading to internal heat, one must adjust the mother’s condition accordingly, avoiding harsh medications for fear of damaging the original qi.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Ulcers and Scabs</strong></p>
<p>Children’s meridians store heat, causing ulcers to form on the head, face, and body. For treatment, use the Four Noble Herbs, adding half a coin&#39;s worth of Trichosanthes root and Platycodon root, and decoct for consumption. When children have skin ulcers in warm weather, frequent washing and changing clothes is helpful, referred to as external dispelling. It is not advisable to take medicine unless absolutely necessary, as this is a purging method. If proper nourishment is maintained, no illness can invade. Breastfeeding should be regulated, avoiding overfeeding, which is the principle of health preservation. </p>
<p>Toxin-based ulcers and scabs arise from inherited fetal heat or food toxins consumed by the mother during pregnancy, along with emotional heat. Initially resembling dry eczema, they later produce pus and water, possibly forming patches. They may occur between the eyebrows or around the ears, corresponding to the Shaoyang channel; if on limbs, it relates to the Spleen and Stomach channel; on the sides, it relates to the Liver channel; on the forehead, to the Heart channel; on the brain, to the Bladder channel; and on the chin and cheeks, to the Kidney channel. Treatment should align with the corresponding channels and the balance of the five organs, considering factors like the mother&#39;s diet and emotions. Care must be taken not to hastily use detoxifying methods or medicines such as rhinoceros horn, as this may further harm the vitality and complicate the condition, making it difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Heat toxin-based ulcers and scabs are caused by premature breastfeeding, a preference for rich and fatty foods leading to accumulation of heat in the organs, or by heavy, rich food consumed by the mother, or excessive emotional heat. It is essential to identify the organ-related causes of the condition, assess its deficiency or excess, and regulate the blood and qi to harmonize defiance. For excess heat in the Liver channel, use Chai Hu Qing Gan San; for deficiency heat, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For excess heat in the Heart channel, use Dao Chi San; for deficiency heat, use Bu Xin Tang.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Yang energies of the human body converge at the head and accumulate on the face. When there are sores, it is due to disharmony among the internal organs, causing blood and Qi to stagnate in the Yang meridians. This may result from a deficiency of kidney Yin and liver fire, or from maternal toxicity during pregnancy, or from the six excesses and seven emotions experienced by the wet nurse, or from the consumption of rich food and strong alcohol, or from overindulgence in sweet and heavy food by the child. The causes differ, thus each condition must be assessed in terms of its meridians, examining the specific cause for treatment.</p>
<p>If the sores appear at the inner corners of the eyes, in front of the ears, on the upper cheeks near the nose, and at the inner corners of the eyes, these are linked to the small intestine meridian. If they occur on the crown of the head, at the lower cheeks, behind the ears, and on both sides of the brain, these belong to the gallbladder meridian. Sores in front of the cheeks near the nostrils, or on either side of the philtrum, relate to the large intestine meridian. Sores on the sides of the nose, beneath the lips, at the承浆 (Chengjiang), behind the ears, on the cheekbones, in front of the ears, and at the hairline on the forehead belong to the stomach meridian. Finally, sores at the inner corners of the eyes, on the forehead, and extending to the back of the head and neck are associated with the bladder meridian.

<p>To treat facial sores in children, when the face is sore and the skin is entirely broken, with pus oozing out, apply aged lard or unsalted pig fat; it is remarkably effective.</p>
<p><strong>Eyebrow Sores</strong></p>
<p>Eyebrow sores refer to sores that develop between a child&#39;s eyebrows resembling scabies. One should seek the cause and treat it accordingly. The eyebrows relate to the gallbladder meridian; if there is inherent heat in the liver and gallbladder or if the wet nurse has heat in her liver and gallbladder, use a decoction of Bupleurum and Gardenia; if the wet nurse consumes rich food and strong alcohol, use a modified Clear Stomach Decoction; if the wet nurse is emotionally distressed, use a modified Xiao Yao San. Both the wet nurse and child should take this, with the child consuming a small amount, considering the previous symptoms. For treating eyebrow sores, apply Qingjin powder; if there is no improvement, burn wheat until charred, grind finely, and mix with good wine for application.</p>
<p><strong>Ear Pus</strong></p>
<p>According to Tang’s writings: There are five types of ear conditions, with constant yellow pus being referred to as &quot;ear fullness,&quot; red pus as &quot;ear pus,&quot; white pus as &quot;entangled ear,&quot; foul-smelling pus as &quot;five ears,&quot; and internal ringing with green pus as &quot;trembling ear.&quot; Although there are five types of symptoms, they all stem from the same source. They result from wind and water entering the ear, causing heat accumulation and obstruction. If not treated early, it may lead to deafness. It is recommended to use lipstick ointment for treatment, along with medications to clear phlegm and reduce heat, to achieve recovery.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mouth Ulcers</p>
<p>Mouth ulcers present differently in form and name, hence the treatment varies. They may arise before illness or occur after an illness has developed. Generally, this ailment does not depend on thinness or leanness; those with excess blood and qi, or those who have been too warm in their nourishment, may experience this. It can also be due to heat in the heart and spleen channels, or heat accumulating in the stomach, which heats and forces upwards to cause ulcers. This is a condition of excess, and treatments should focus on dispelling heat and extracting toxins to eliminate inflammation, resulting in natural recovery.</p>
<p>One may use Danggui powder with additions of Shengma, Gancao, Huangqin, Shengjiang, green onions, and prepared as a decoction; also consider Burdock root soup, Detoxifying drink, and Mutong powder, applied with nitrate yellow powder.</p>
<p>If the ulcers present as white sores on the tongue and there are external ulcers on the lips, characterized by few but large sores, with little pain and often fluid discharge, this is due to internal heat vaporizing from spleen deficiency. The internal ailment manifests externally, so it is advisable to use Baijiesan to disperse and release the exterior; Danggui powder with water, ginger, and jujube boiled together can harmonize the stomach qi and regulate internal heat. Following that, one may use Burdock root soup and Sanjiesan, applying it with Lüpao powder for immediate effect. Drinking Huangjin powder or using Tianzhuhuang powder or Dihuang paste can also help.</p>
<p>If the ulcer forms at the corners of the mouth, it indicates excessive heat in the spleen, causing dryness and pain upon opening the mouth, making eating and drinking difficult.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a></p></div>

<p>If there is an unexplained bad breath with decay that does not form sores, or if cooling agents or powdered medicines do not heal it, this is named Yuan Jiao. Therefore, Shu He in &quot;Pulse Treatise&quot; states: when there is a frail heat in the spleen along with bad breath, this indicates that the spleen has empty heat rising to the mouth, so one should take the Hui Yang powder.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Lung Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Lung abscess and lung emaciation arise from the weakness of spleen and lung qi, leading to loose pores that allow external pathogens to invade. It may also occur if the mother consumes spicy and rich foods, passing heat to the child; or if the child is ill and suffers excessive sweating that depletes body fluids, resulting in deficient fire damaging the lungs; or from the administration of harsh medications that impair the spleen and stomach, preventing them from nourishing the lung metal. The symptoms include aversion to wind, coughing, nasal congestion, stiff neck, difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, slight swelling of the limbs, along with coughing up purulent blood. If fetid and foul-smelling vomit occurs, accompanied by hidden pain in the chest and a rapid, strong pulse, it indicates a lung abscess. Coughing up phlegm and saliva with a rapid and weak pulse indicates lung emaciation. An aversion to cold and wheezing reveals an internal retention of cold pathogenic factors, treated with Xiao Qing Long Tang. Coughing up purulent foul matter indicates internal perforation of the lung, treated with Jie Geng Tang. I opine that if there are symptoms of wheezing with shortness of breath, it indicates weakness in spleen and lung qi, requiring Wu Wei Yi Gong San. Coughing up purulent phlegm with a rapid but weak left pulse indicates kidney qi deficiency, treated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. Coughing up purulent phlegm with a rapid but weak right pulse suggests spleen qi deficiency, treated with Qi Wei Bai Zhu San. If there is fever, wheezing, and inability to eat while coughing up pus, it signifies severe deficiency of spleen and lung, which is difficult to treat. The primary approach is to tonify the spleen and lung, nourish kidney essence, and observe the interactions among the five organs while considering the emotions of the nursing mother. Follow similar principles for subsequent symptoms.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Intestinal Abscess</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Zhongjing said: The symptoms of intestinal abscess arise from dietary heat accumulation, or from a mother’s consumption of spicy and hot foods. When pressing the lower abdomen, there is pain; urination is frequent and resembles dysuria; there is abdominal urgency and a dislike of cold; the skin feels tight, and there may be spontaneous sweating and aversion to cold. If the pulse is slow and tight and there is no pus present, use Xianfang Huoming Decoction to dispel the poison; if the pulse is surging and rapid and pus is present, take Taiyi Ointment to expel the pus. If there is abdominal pain and difficulty urinating, it indicates pus stagnation, which can be addressed by Mudanpi Powder. I secretly believe that the texts state: Intestinal abscess is a disease that should not cause alarm, for fright can lead to rupture of the intestines and death. Therefore, in sitting, lying, or turning, one must move slowly and gently, occasionally drink diluted porridge, and use Eight Treasure Soup to strengthen the vital energy, allowing for calm nurturing and regulation, which may help preserve health.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Poison from the Bowels</strong></p>
<p>This poison arises from liver fire or liver damp-heat, or it may be due to heat toxin in the liver channel. If there is initial swelling, hardness, and pain, begin with one or two doses of Longdan Xiegan Decoction; if the swelling and pain do not diminish, use two doses of Xianfang Huo Ming Decoction. If after five to seven days the swelling remains hard and does not reduce, also use each of the previous two medicines once. If it does not resolve or becomes more painful, indicating potential pus formation, use one dose of Huo Ming Decoction and then apply Tuoli Xiaodu San with added Chaihu and Sanzi for one or two doses. </p>
<p>If pus has formed but is not draining, it&#39;s due to blood and qi deficiency; use Tuoli Xiaodu San for one or two doses. If pus has drained but pain persists, it indicates unresolved toxins; administer one dose of Huo Ming Decoction. If pus has emerged but pain recurs, it suggests blood and qi deficiency; use Neibu Huangqi Decoction. For cases where pus has drained and there are symptoms of fever and agitation, indicating qi deficiency and blood loss, use Danggui Bubai Decoction. If pus has drained and there are chills with fever, indicating both blood and qi deficiency, use Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction. </p>
<p>If there are chills after pus has drained, indicating yuan qi deficiency, use Buzhong Yiqi Decoction.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Frostbite on the toes occurs due to a deficiency of vitality and an inability to withstand cold, making it easy for cold pathogens to invade. When the qi and blood stagnate for a long time without healing, it can lead to ulceration and the formation of sores. The treatment must focus on strengthening the spleen and stomach and warming the qi and blood, allowing necrotic tissue to slough off and healthy flesh to regenerate. If there is detachment of bone and tendon, it should be urgently excised; otherwise, toxic secretions could lead to death. Indeed, at the extremities, qi and blood find it difficult to reach, and when obstructed by external pathogens, the flow of qi and blood becomes stagnant. If treated with hot water, it leads to internal death and loss of sensation; by spring, it will surely ulcerate, rot, and fall off. If the vital energy is not depleted, even if ill, there is no harm. However, if cold medications are applied externally and detoxifying agents are ingested, the vital energy may be harmed, leading to failure to heal. In cases of initial frostbite, frequent warm hand compresses are effective. In the north, if one mistakenly touches their frostbitten ear, it may fall off. Extreme cold can indeed crack the skin and cause fingers to fall off, which is true!</p>
<p>For burns and scalds, if there is fever and thirst along with red and painful urination, it indicates internal heat; use Si Wu Decoction with added Gardenia fruit, Forsythia, and Licorice. If there is pain but the flesh is not necrotic, it indicates heat toxin; apply Si Jun Zi Decoction with added Chuanxiong, Gardenia fruit, and Forsythia. If the flesh is dead but not ulcerating, there is qi and blood deficiency; use Si Jun Zi Decoction with added Angelica and Astragalus, and apply Angelica ointment externally or a mixture of cypress leaf powder and wax oil. If due to smoke it is at risk of death, irrigate with juice from fresh radish, and it will revive. If one suffers burns or scalds post-meal, resulting in fever, abdominal distension, aversion to food, and spasms, one should seek treatment for food accumulation and convulsions.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Flipping Flower Sores</strong></p>
<p>The condition of flipping flower sores arises after ulcers rupture, when wind and cold invade the affected area, or when liver fire and blood dryness generate wind, or when the milk mother&#39;s liver fire generates wind. This will inevitably lead to the ulcer edges becoming protruding like meat, resembling mushrooms, varying in size from that of a finger and differing in length. </p>
<p>If the wind evil persists, first use the Qi-preserving and Energy-reinforcing Decoction, adding Fangfeng and Tianma.

<p>For wind evil lurking, apply a bean curd paste externally; for wind and cold stagnation, use the scallion compress method externally. Use Taiyi Ointment to protect the ulcer&#39;s opening; if the protruding meat does not diminish, apply Li Lu Ointment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Multiple Bone Ulcer</strong></p>
<p>Multiple bone ulcer arises from long-standing sores, depleting the spleen and stomach, causing blood and qi to fail to nourish the affected area. Evil qi invades; over time, tendons rot and bones decay, resulting in bones protruding, which is not due to congenital factors. One should nourish the spleen and stomach, strengthen vital qi, using internal remedies such as Dabu soup and Dihuang pills, and for external treatment, apply aconite cakes and onion poultices to dispel cold evil and replenish vital qi, leading to spontaneous separation of the bone and healing of the ulcer. If one uses harsh and destructive remedies, it can further harm the true qi and is rarely without danger. In infants suffering from this condition, one must adjust and supplement the nursing mother&#39;s diet and use external onion poultices to gradually alleviate the issue, particularly avoiding any aggressive corrosive drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of ulcers stem from insufficient innate qi and blood, or prolonged illness resulting in weak qi and blood, or from a child&#39;s liver and spleen being burdened by internal heat from food accumulation, which fails to produce muscle. Additionally, if the nursing mother experiences emotional imbalance, it further complicates the condition. If the spleen qi cannot consolidate, one must carefully assess the underlying causes, restore vital qi, and apply supportive remedies like Shengbing and onion poultices. Using draining and corrosive medicines, however, would only worsen the condition. I shall consult various experts on this matter.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a></p></div>

<p>For conditions involving redness, swelling, pain, and fever that have not turned into pus, as well as during hot summer months, apply a mixture of tea and honey. If there is slight heat and swelling or if large sores have already formed pus, use a mixture of green onion broth and honey.

<p>If the disease arises from wind-heat, with symptoms of excessively hot, bright red skin that changes shape, use a mixture of honey water. For conditions such as tinea, fire blisters, red evacuation blisters, yellow water lacquer sores, and malignant blood attacks, apply a mixture of crushed great blue root leaves with honey. For burns with broken skin, use sesame oil for application. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Jade Red Ointment for Regeneration is truly remarkable, with a subtle flavor known to few. It combines angelica, licorice, and light powder, while the white and purple roots are particularly suitable. This ointment specifically treats carbuncles and abscesses, as well as various ulcers caused by toxins. For already ruptured sores with pus, first wash with licorice decoction, then rinse the affected area with pig&#39;s foot soup. Clean it with soft silk, then take some ointment in the palm of your hand and let it melt. Apply it generously on the new decaying flesh, then cover it with Taiyi Ointment. Large sores should be washed and changed twice daily, and internally, one should also take warming medications to strengthen the spleen and stomach. The rotten flesh will easily detach, and new flesh will generate, allowing the sore to close on its own. This is indeed a miraculous remedy among external contraction medicines.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Five qian of angelica, one liang and two qian of licorice, two liang of angelica root, four qian each of blood gall and light powder, two liang of white silk, two qian of purple root, and one jin of sesame oil. First, combine four ingredients—angelica, licorice, purple root, and angelica root—and soak them in oil for three days. Then, slowly simmer in a ladle over low heat until the color slightly darkens; filter through fine silk, then return the oil to the ladle and bring to a boil. Add the blood gall until completely dissolved, then add the white silk and let it melt over low heat. Prepare four cups with water, divide the ointment into four portions, and pour it into the cups. After a while, add finely ground light powder, one qian to each cup, and stir evenly. Allow it to set for a brief time before removing. Do not alter the recipe, as it may lead to ineffectiveness.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Toad Su Pill is renowned for its efficacy, combining ingredients such as milk, myrrh, alum, and light powder, with components like green vitriol, toad venom, cold water musk, snail, and centipede for its utility. It treats abscesses, boils on the back, brain ulcers, breast pus, and bone-related swellings, as well as various serious ailments and foul sores, whether they are painless or numb, or accompanied by vomiting. In severe cases, it can lead to stupor; but this medicine, when taken, will trigger dormant issues, alleviate pain, restore consciousness, relieve vomiting, eliminate unformed conditions, and dissolve mature ones, demonstrating true life-saving abilities—it is an invaluable elixir among grave illnesses.</p>
<p>Ingredients: Two qian of toad venom, dissolved in wine; five fen of light powder; one qian each of dry alum, calcined cold water stone, green vitriol, myrrh, frankincense, orpiment, and musk; two qian of realgar; twenty-one snails; and two qian of cinnabar. All should be finely ground and measured accurately. On the noon of the Dragon Boat Festival, in a clean room, first crush the snails, then mix with the toad venom to form a thick paste. Subsequently, add all other ingredients and thoroughly crush them together until uniform, shaping into pills the size of a broad bean. The dosage is three pills, taken with five inches of green onion, which the patient should chew thoroughly and spit out in the center of their left hand (for males) or right hand (for females), wrapping the medicine inside. Wash down with hot, ash-free wine in a teacup, and walk five to six miles to induce sweating for effect; if symptoms are serious, a second dose may be taken. During the administration period, women and animals should not be present.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Taiyi Purple Gold Elixir</p>
<p>The Taiyi Purple Gold Elixir is made with major ingredients including the large dandelion, Cyperus tuber, and the clam, together weighing a thousand gold. The male musk and vermilion weigh a total of seven parts, with various ailments and symptoms all responding to this divine remedy. It resolves all poisons, heals various wounds, benefits passageways, and effectively treats countless diseases. This medicine genuinely has the ability to bring the dead back to life, and its formulation offers remarkable effects for helping others, which cannot be fully described. It is indispensable for those who enter and exit households, engage in major constructions, or mobilize large armies, as well as for officials from Fujian, Guangxi, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>To prepare, the mountain dandelion is cleaned of its skin and hair, then dried thoroughly, two taels. Five-fold gall, two taels. The musk is ground finely, three qian. The white seeds of the continued-wort, with oil removed, are cleaned, one tael. The red bud of the large dandelion from Hangzhou is considered superior; the local large dandelion from Jiangnan is second, while the northern cotton dandelion, which is white in color, is too potent and can harm the正气 (vital energy), causing those who are weak to vomit blood—this is not suitable for use. Only the superior form is chosen, with the root removed and thoroughly cleaned and dried into a powder, one tael and five qian. Vermilion that is lively and bright red in large chunks must be ground finely, three qian each for the above medicines, selecting the best quality in a clean space for preparation. </p>
<p>Wait for auspicious dates such as the Dragon Boat Festival, Qixi Festival, Chongyang Festival, or on days with celestial merit or the celestial physician, and ensure that any person entering the room for the preparation has fasted and bathed three days prior, changing into clean, new clothing and hats. On the appointed day, they should enter the room with clean hands, incense burning, and set up a spirit tablet for the medicine. The host leads others in burning incense and praying. Once completed, each of the seven ingredients is measured and placed into a large mortar, ground for hundreds of turns, then placed into a fine stone mortar, gradually adding glutinous rice and thick liquid to mix, balancing soft and hard until the mixture is pounded over a thousand times, until achieving a polished finish.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p></div>

It treats all sorts of dietary poisons, toxins, epidemic miasmas, harmful bacteria, pufferfish poisoning, as well as the meat of carrion from dead cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep; consumption of this can lead to confusion and immediate collapse, or strange symptoms may appear. Administer it through water grinding, resulting in either vomiting or diarrhea, and the person will surely recover. The miasma from southern hills, smoky epidemics, is particularly harmful. Upon feeling discomfort, cold or hot, with nausea that does not relieve, grinding and taking one pill will help induce vomiting and restore balance. It can also treat boils, abscesses, mouth sores, unnamed swellings, red-threaded rot, and conditions like bayberry sores, various wind rashes, longstanding hemorrhoids, by grinding it with clear, low-ash wine for internal use, and applying with water for external use on the sores, repeatedly throughout the day and night until itching diminishes and healing occurs.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

Apply it to the swelling as well. For young children, divide a dose into several parts. For toothache, grind it and apply it to the painful area, and hold a little in the mouth for a while before swallowing. If an infant shows signs of inherited toxins, with skin peeling and spots within a hundred days of birth, or if the mouth or eyes are damaged, use clear water to grind and apply. For injuries from falls, use turpentine mixed with ashless wine to take. Those suffering from prolonged headaches or discomfort at the temples due to lingering toxicity after a rash should take a ground dose and apply it to the temples. For women with menstrual blockages, use safflower soup. In the case of widespread infectious diseases, where an epidemic has spread through streets and alleys, use peach root soup, ground to a paste, and rub it into the nostrils, also taking a small amount to ensure it reaches the sick without spreading further. This also treats wasting diseases when other medicines fail. A certain healer recommended it; take one dose every morning, and after three doses, expel harmful substances and irregular forms from the body, thus achieving relief and restoring health—countless lives have been saved this way. One woman, suffering for a long time from a wasting disease caused by parasitic worms, took a dose, and shortly afterward expelled over ten small worms.

<p>Note: The above formula may deplete the middle qi and harm yin blood. If the patient is robust, with strong spleen and stomach, it may be used cautiously. However, children, due to their tender and delicate constitution, may not withstand this. As the classics say: &quot;Qi governs the expulsion, blood governs nourishment.&quot; Qi is the fundamental energy that harmonizes the stomach. If the stomach qi is compromised, it cannot dispel or dissipate. If pus has formed, it may not rupture; if it has ruptured, it may not regenerate flesh or converge. Therefore, it is hard to treat and may even lead to serious consequences, so caution is essential!<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There must be an internal aspect that manifests externally; hence, the sutras concerning what is experienced and the location of affliction are distinct, making it improper to universally apply external cooling medicines. Only when the spleen and stomach are intact, and blood and qi are harmonious, might they be effective. If one takes detoxifying medicines that injure the spleen and stomach, causing stagnation of blood and qi, they cannot dispel toxins. For conditions like abscesses, the intent is to expel the poison; however, if previous medicines are used again, cold will damage the muscles, and blood and qi will stagnate, leading to internal poison that is beyond remedy. The treatment must carefully consider the height and extent of swelling, color (whether red or white), the severity of pain, the ease or difficulty of pus formation, the thickness of pus output, and the speed of new tissue growth to determine its nature as yin or yang, or a mix of both. Appropriate medicines should be used to cool, heat, or harmonize as needed. One should also examine the transmission of symptoms and the interactions of the five organs, with a focus on nourishing the spleen and stomach to avoid worsening the condition.</p>

<p>Ingredients: Ginseng, fried Astragalus, Angelica Sinensis, Chuanxiong, fried Peony, Atractylodes, Poria, Honeysuckle, fried Angelica dings, fried Licorice, Lonicera, and Chaihu, each seven parts; Gardenia, four parts.

<p><strong>Shenxiao Angelica Ointment</strong> </p>
<p>Used to treat sores from burns and scalds, regardless of whether they have broken or not. It can heal for injuries wherein the flesh is wounded but not rotten, and for those where the flesh has already died, it can induce suppuration and promote new flesh growth. Apply until the flesh gradually turns white, indicating the poison has dissipated, and it promotes muscle regrowth swiftly. This ointment consists of Angelica Sinensis, raw Rehmannia, sesame oil, and beeswax, all known for promoting flesh regrowth, relieving pain, nourishing blood, and replenishing sinews, and is especially suitable for new flesh.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Angelica Sinensis and raw Rehmannia, each one tael; yellow beeswax, one tael; only half a tael if white beeswax is used. First, take Angelica and Rehmannia, and decoct in four taels of sesame oil until dry and residue is removed. Then melt the wax, let it cool, and mix evenly; this completes the ointment. Apply it to the affected area and cover with oil paper. Particularly effective for carbuncles and severe ulcers; when dead flesh is undergoing decay and is about to detach, only a few connections remain, use a sharp knife to cut them away. This is because dead flesh is toxic, and slow removal can damage new flesh. After all dead flesh is removed, prompt application is especially important, as new flesh is most vulnerable to wind and cold, and should not be neglected.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat children&#39;s moon disease sores, appearing with the lunar phases: mix ground fragrant powder with butter and apply; it will heal in five days.</p>
<p>To treat sores in all nine orifices due to moon disease: burn earthworm droppings to a fine powder and mix with pig fat to apply. Alternatively: mix with water and apply in powder form.</p>
<p>To treat swelling in infants&#39; hands, feet, and body: soak with warm urine; this is effective. Additionally: take fifty ba dou seeds, remove the heart and skin, boil in three liters of water to obtain one liter, then use cotton to wipe the affected area with the liquid; this will dispel the ailment. It also treats itch rashes.</p>
<p>To treat hot sores arising in newborns: take five chicken eggs, break them, discard the whites, keep the yolks, cook them, mix with loose hair to resemble the size of a yolk, and boil the two ingredients together to extract the juice for application. Furthermore, apply a powder of bitter root; this is remarkably effective. Liu Yuxi states: when I had a child in Wuling, there were hot sores appearing in the arms and legs, spreading halfway across the body. Initially using other medications proved useless, and the infant cried day and night without nursing. Upon reading the &quot;Bencao,&quot; I found that mixing loose hair with chicken yolk and boiling produces a liquid to treat children&#39;s heat-related ailments and diarrhea. It&#39;s noted to expel phlegm and heat from a hundred diseases; the chicken yolk is said in &quot;Bencao&quot; to treat hot sores. Thus, I used it and saw immediate results. Boiling method: the chicken yolks and loose hair are initially quite dry in the pot; after a while, they will char, releasing liquid. Quickly transfer this liquid into a ceramic bowl, using it entirely as needed.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a></p></div>

<p>Wan&#39;s &quot;Jade Heart Book&quot; states: For all swellings and toxins in children, the leech needle method is to be used. Take five or six large leeches, place them on the swollen area to suck out the bad blood, which can cure red lumps and drain abscesses. Wang Kentang&#39;s &quot;Standards of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: For treating red dan毒 (toxic heat), which moves unpredictably, gather the blood in one spot, use a fine porcelain vessel to crush, take the sharp edges, split apart with chopstick ends, and tie with thread. Pinch lightly with two fingers on the chopsticks, allowing the sharp edge to focus on the blood gathering area; then use another chopstick to strike repeatedly, piercing out the toxic blood. If it is mild, let it be sucked out by mouth and apply medicine. If the condition is on the head, do not use the stone therapy; instead, use needles to lift and stimulate the affected area to draw out the toxic blood; delay can lead to the toxic blood entering the abdomen, making it difficult to expel. If the toxicity increases after stone therapy, use Shen Gong San (Divine Efficacy Powder); if mild, avoid using stone therapy afterward to prevent pain from the broken skin. For treating flowing sores and abscesses, as well as &quot;crane knee wind&quot; and similar conditions, perform moxibustion two to thirty times daily; for painful conditions, heat until the pain subsides, and for non-painful areas, continue until pain is elicited, allowing the toxin to disperse with the heat.<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To address the obstruction caused by fire and to dispel toxic elements, this method is essential in treatment and has the power of revival. The procedure involves taking garlic, peeling it, and slicing it into coins about three-fingers thick. Place it on the affected area and apply moxa on top of the garlic to perform three moxa treatments. Replace the garlic and continue the moxibustion; if the condition is not yet resolved, it will dissipate, and even if already developed, it will still eliminate the poison. For larger sores, mash garlic and spread it over the affected area, then apply moxa on top and burn it, replacing the garlic as needed. If there is no pain, or if pus forms, or if it does not develop, particularly for sores associated with Yin conditions, moxibustion should be performed frequently. In general, sores that do not hurt, do not produce pus, or do not develop are indicative of Qi and blood deficiency, and these should typically not be treated. However, for issues on the head and face, extensive moxibustion is not advisable. </p>
<p>For treating conditions like stream and tubercular swelling, bone abscesses, and conditions like &quot;crane knee,&quot; begin with indirect moxibustion over garlic. If residual swelling persists, apply this to aid Qi, promote blood flow, and dissipate the stagnation, yielding swift results. This method is also excellent for treating injuries from falls, relieving pain, dispersing blood, and reducing swelling. The procedure involves finely chopping and mashing green onions, frying them until cooked, and frequently applying them to the affected area, replacing them once cool. For &quot;crane knee wind,&quot; it is effective when combined with Da Fengfeng Decoction for recovery.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a></p></div>

I further asked: &quot;What did the mother crave during her pregnancy?&quot; Zhang replied: &quot;Spicy and hot foods were what she liked.&quot; I then prescribed a formula consisting of ginseng, forsythia, angelica, licorice, dried tangerine peel, peony, and hemp plant, boiled into a concentrated decoction, mixed with bamboo juice and given to him. After several days, he became stable. Someone asked: &quot;How did you know this?&quot; I replied: &quot;I noticed his spirit was dull and tired, the illness was deep-seated, and there was no external pathogen; what else could it be but maternal toxin?&quot;</p>
<p>My second daughter, lean and quick-tempered, had a constitution with heat. In her third month of pregnancy, during the peak of summer heat, she felt parched, craved water, and occasionally had mild fevers. I instructed her to take the Four Substances Decoction with added scutellaria, dried tangerine peel, licorice, and hemp plant. Due to her laziness in cooking, she stopped after a few doses. Later, this child, at the age of two, developed sores all over his body, which suddenly healed one day, and a few days later he developed mumps. I stated: &quot;This is maternal toxin. If the sores arise again, the disease can self-resolve.&quot; And indeed, it happened just as I said. If during her pregnancy she had strictly followed the prescribed formula, she would not have been ill!</p>
<p>Tang Shi said: The daughter of General Zhang San, aged fifteen, suffered from measles. Many physicians tried numerous remedies but were unsuccessful. She called me to see her, and with fresh Four Substances Decoction plus fangfeng and scutellaria, she recovered within a day.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text from &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: A small child from the Huang family had a swollen, red face and could not open his eyes. A practitioner lightly pricked him with a (golden needle), removing the sharp points from his eyes and performing dozens of needle pricks that led to bleeding three times, after which he recovered. Many practitioners are unwilling to follow this method; they insist on treating illnesses without careful protection.</p>
<p>According to Wan&#39;s &quot;Young Child Explanation,&quot; a small child had a red rash on his face, with swollen eyes, and could not be approached. He died after three days.</p>
<p>A small child had numerous boils on his head, experiencing chills and pain during summer, with symptoms fully manifesting. First, a dose of Ren Shen Bai Du San, augmented with Huang Lian and Xiang Ru was given, which immediately relieved the pain; next, Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin was administered. Within three doses, the larger boils purged pus, while the smaller ones resolved on their own. After consuming rich food again, symptoms recurred, which required Qing Wei San and Huo Ming Yin to be taken once each to cure him.</p>
<p>A small child had swelling and pain in his head and face, which was attributed to heat toxin in the stomach channel. Initially, Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin was used, followed by Qing Wei San, leading to recovery. Later, ulcers appeared on the tongue, requiring topical application of powdered medicine, and he experienced severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and lack of appetite, with cold extremities. I diagnosed it as spleen and stomach deficiency with cold, treated with Yi Gong San augmented with Sheng Ma, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A small child, over ten days old, had a sizeable poisonous sore on his head with a red halo, and the situation was critical. During treatment, black blood was drawn with a guillotine needle, causing the child to feel secure. The following day, he developed a similar condition between his eyebrows, which also exhibited a red halo. I believed immediate treatment with the needle was necessary, but the consensus was to wait until the second day for treatment. Ultimately, the blood clotted and could not be drawn, leading to abdominal bloating and death.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suffered from heat毒 (toxic heat) on the face, and after taking medicine to clear the stomach, the swelling and pain worsened. I thought the toxic energy was excessive and the blood stagnation had not subsided, so I used the Immortal Life Restoring Drink twice, and the child recovered. Later, due to food injury, experiencing morning chills and evening heat, the face again suffered this ailment. After taking fire-reducing medicine, the mouth and tongue became red and swollen, and the hands and feet were cold. I believed the stomach energy was again damaged and turned to cold, so I used the Five Flavor Distinctive Powder and the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another child was born with a body covered in itchy rashes and enjoyed being rubbed and patted. I prepared a prescription: using black snake wine, soak and roast to obtain one qian (about three grams) of meat; soak and roast two qian of bitter onion wine; stir-fried sesame seeds and stir-fried white thistle, each one qian and five fen (about five grams total). I combined these into a powder, mixed the soaked snake and bitter onion wine into a paste to form pills, and administered them with licorice soup, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A five-year-old boy developed pus-filled blisters all over his body every spring, which was a fetal toxin. I advised avoiding topical medicines, fearing that powdered arsenic and sulfur toxins could enter the belly through weaknesses. Instead, I treated him with sesame seed pills and he recovered. Additionally, I applied moxibustion to Fengchi, Xuechi, Quuchi, and Sanli points, and thereafter, he never had a recurrence.</p>
<p>The daughter of the Wang family, aged four, had a lump behind her ear. When asked, I stated: it is not a sore but a phlegm nodule. There is no need for treatment, as it is not harmful. Under the misguidance of another doctor, she was treated as if it were a sore, taking excessive medicine made from the prickly pear inside, which harmed her spleen and stomach, leading to illness and death—how tragic! Another child developed swollen, hard, and painful lumps near the front of the ear, commonly known as mumps. I applied the Detoxifying Powder, and it was remarkably effective.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child suffered from sores in the mouth, and the doctor applied various medicines such as ge gen, lian, zhi, and bo, but to no avail. I said it was caused by heat in the heart, and the bitter herbs would only aggravate that heat; hence it was ineffective. I then created a &quot;washing heart powder&quot; for them, which provided relief after one dose.</p>
<p>My nephew had sores all over his mouth, throat, lips, and tongue, prompting me to prescribe medicine. I formulated a prescription using three grams each of bo he and lian, five grams of red mercury and white alum, and three grams of dried pillbug, grinding it finely; it worked immediately, which was remarkable.</p>
<p>The &quot;Family Compilation on Smallpox&quot; by the Wan family states: After a small child&#39;s smallpox scabs fall off, the scars appear white. Someone asked me about this, and I said it indicates qi deficiency. The lungs, being the master of qi, are associated with the color white, so one should use ginseng and astragalus for a strong nourishing formula, or else there could be complications. The person responded, &quot;The smallpox has already cleared up, how could there be complications?&quot; One month later, the child suffered from severe wheezing and died.</p>
<p>The county magistrate&#39;s grandson developed smallpox. After the scabs fell off for over a month, the scars remained swollen, and now they began to discharge. Any toxic condition emerging from within is auspicious; I suggested a mixture of angelica stem, red peony, fang feng, jing jie, lian qiao, burdock seed, black ginseng, cicada shell, and sbeng ma, blended into a powder and infused with a decoction of bamboo leaves to adjust and take for relief.</p>
<p>A child had the scabs fall off, but the scars became swollen and itchy. I was consulted, and I said this was due to wind-heat. I prescribed the ginseng antidote powder added with fang feng and jing jie, and the child felt better after one dose. For others who experienced the same, using the jing jie antidote powder combined with ginseng and bathing in willow broth was effective as well.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child, after losing scabs, had uneven scars. When asked, I said: The family of smallpox advises against eating ginger, for fear that the marks will not be even. When inquired, it was indeed the case.</p>
<p>A young child after losing scabs developed swelling that turned into sores, which did not heal for a long time. They asked me to treat it, and I said: This is a pox toxin sore, caused by the child having picked at it, preventing it from falling off naturally, thus injuring the flesh and causing sores to reappear. I prescribed bitter herb pills, and it healed.</p>
<p>In Qishui, after the summer, a child of Nan Changzi developed boils after smallpox; they asked me to check. I saw their complexion was dark, looking tired and weak, and they had little appetite. I said: The child’s smallpox has not matured properly; the scabs were removed too soon. Now the boils are erupting, indicating a deficiency returning to the kidney, likely unable to produce pus and may lead to death. It turned out to be true.</p>
<p>Another young child developed boils after smallpox and urgently asked for treatment. I used the Ten Complete Great Nourishing Decoction, adding forsythia and honeysuckle, and treated it to recovery. Since the boils had already burst, this formula was used. Those who had burst boils have all been treated successfully with this.</p>
<p>A young child after smallpox developed boils and immediately asked for treatment. I used a detoxifying internal dispersing powder to adjust and they recovered.</p>
<p>A young child after smallpox developed a fever, and had difficulty with urination and defecation, with red scars. Other doctors said it was due to deficiency, wanting to use the Baoyuan Decoction. I said: No, this is actual heat! It was caused by eating spicy and hot foods.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The local magistrate, Lord Tang Xiaofeng, was twelve years old when he contracted smallpox in the first month of the Wuchen year. At that time, Tang asked me to enter the capital with him, so I invited my fourth son, Bangzhi, and my eighth son, Bangjing, to assist Han Fengqi in treating the pockmarks. Later, a red swelling appeared on his right shoulder, which was not an abscess. Han pricked it with a needle, but he could not lift his hand. At the end of March, Xiaofeng returned north and, upon reaching Shangcai, was greatly worried. I reassured him, saying, &quot;Do not worry!&quot; Upon examining him, I found that his hand was not painful but weak and powerless; he could not lift it by himself and had to use his left hand to do so. When Tang asked the reason, I said, &quot;It is due to liver heat and Qi deficiency.&quot; The liver governs the tendons, providing blood for nourishment; in cold, it contracts, and in heat, it expands. Only by replenishing Qi and nourishing blood will the illness resolve. So, I prepared a formula using ginseng, astragalus, angelica, ligusticum, white peony root, teasel root, licorice, white atractylodes, balloon flower, cardamom, coix seed, and mifang to make into pills, which he took for half a month and recovered.</p>
<p>A small child, after bathing, experienced swelling all over his face and body and asked me to treat him. I replied, &quot;This is due to water Qi.&quot; I used the Si Junzi Decoction to strengthen the spleen and remove dampness, added astragalus to bolster the exterior, and used saposhnikovia to counteract the dampness at the muscle surface and ephedra to expel the water from under the skin. After one dose, the swelling reduced. Later, I used the Qian family&#39;s Yigong Powder with additional polyporus and alisma to adjust and he recovered.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a></p></div>

Various physicians treated him for bone steaming fatigue, but his condition worsened over six months. A physician named Dai examined him and found that his pulse was strong and directed towards theuan (an acupoint), while the pulse at the same location was notably large. Dai stated, &quot;This is lung abscess.&quot; When he asked the boy&#39;s wet nurse if there had been any painful areas, she replied, &quot;No.&quot; Dai instructed the boy to remove his clothing and raised both of his arms, observing that the right side of his ribcage was slightly elevated.

May I ask why this is?&quot; Dong Yuan replied, &quot;Let me ponder over it.&quot; The next day, he met with Shuhe and said, &quot;I have figured it out. There is concealed fire in your kidneys, and your essence contains much red silk, which is transmitted through qi, resulting in this ailment in your offspring. When disturbed, it manifests in the muscles, commonly referred to as fetal tumors.&quot; Shuhe examined this and found it was indeed as Dong Yuan described. He then took several doses of Kidney Nourishing Pill to expel the fire evil from his kidneys and to replenish the deficiency of the Heavenly True essence, while avoiding wine, meat, and pungent hot foods. His wife used Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to nourish her yin blood. After five months of pregnancy, she took a decoction made from Atractylodes and Scutellaria. Eventually, they had a son who, by the age of three, did not exhibit the previous symptoms again. Shuhe remarked, &quot;You are indeed a divine physician!&quot; and subsequently studied under him.

Treatments like ginseng and atractylodes did not respond. Some believed it to be chronic fright. I observed the pulse at the wrists and found it red, indicating wind-heat.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suffered from an external ailment that seemed mild, but internally experienced pain and blockage. This condition was located in the organs. They took a decoction of Forsythia and applied Shen Gong San, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child had issues with the buttocks, characterized by red swelling. This prompted frequent sucking, which caused the poison to accumulate in one place. Thus, black blood was drawn out, and an application of enhanced Shen Gong San was made. They used honeysuckle and licorice as powder, mixed with human milk for ingestion, and the child recovered. After more than a month, both legs were still swollen and treated as before, leading to healing. A few days later, the legs turned red again. They attempted to use rhinoceros horn to detoxify. The child had no appetite, and the abdomen was distended, once again harming the spleen and stomach. They continued applying the previous medication and took a restorative decoction with added Poria, resulting in recovery. Shen Gong San was effective but caused slight pain at the needled area; using Tai Yi Dan also helped.</p>
<p>A young child suffered in the leg, appearing as usual, eating normally. The poison was manifesting on the surface of the skin.

Cold and cooling agents harm the spleen&#39;s energy, while harsh medications damage the vital energy; what other outcome could there be?</p>
<p>A young child frequently experienced swelling in both legs resembling toxin, but without blisters. There was excessive phlegm and a red chin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child had legs like clouds, moving restlessly. I first applied sesame oil to the affected area to draw out the toxic blood, which immediately dispersed the poison. Then I used a nine-ingredient detoxifying powder, and after one dose, the child was at peace.</p>
<p>Another child, due to the mother drinking wine and then nursing, was in a deep sleep and didn&#39;t wake, with their body resembling swollen red sores. I suspected that the wine&#39;s poison was transmitted to the child, so I instructed both mother and child to take kudzu root decoction to alleviate the inebriation, and they recovered.</p>
<p>A woman had a red rash like clouds, accompanied by itching and heat. This was due to heat in the blood of the liver channel. I treated her with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding raw Rehmannia, Forsythia, and Moutan, and she recovered. Generally, when a woman&#39;s menstrual cycle approaches or is irregular due to shock or anger, many exhibit this condition, which can also be treated with the aforementioned medicine.</p>
<p>A child had a swollen throat and experienced thirst, with dry and hard stool, and redness on the right cheek. This indicated excess heat in the lung and large intestine channels. I prescribed Chai Hu Decoction, and the child recovered. Later, due to food stagnation, I gave a stringent remedy, but the throat remained swollen and the abdomen bloated and painful, indicating further injury to spleen qi. I used Yi Gong San with added Sheng Ma and Angelica, and the child was cured.</p>
<p>A child suffered the previous symptoms due to maternal anger, also grinding teeth and yawning. I believed this was a sign of deficiency heat in the liver channel, so I prescribed Sweet Tangerine Decoction with additions of Chai Hu, Gardenia, and Burdock seeds, while the mother took Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, and they both recovered.</p>
<p>One child had an excessive craving for rich food, suffering from a swollen and painful throat and overflowing phlegm. After taking a purgative pill, symptoms worsened, with blood coming from the mouth and nose, sores on the lips and tongue, and unformed stools. I used Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction to clear the heat from rich food, employed Dongyuan&#39;s Anwei San to resolve the toxicity from the purgative, and additionally applied Platycodon Decoction, leading to recovery.<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a></p></div>

This was due to heat in the heart and liver channels, treated successfully with Chai Hu Qing Gan San. Later, after being frightened and taking Zhi Bao Dan, the child vomited phlegm, experienced convulsions, and had cold hands and feet. This was because the liver wood was deficient and the lung metal was overpowering it, treated with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to strengthen the spleen and lungs, along with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish the liver and kidney, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another young child presented with redness on the forehead, heat in the soles of the feet, and constant throat pain. After taking medicine to clear stomach heat and eliminate toxins, I suspected a deficiency of kidney water and excessive fire in the heart. I recommended Di Huang Wan to strengthen the water aspect to counter the yang.

<p>A six-year-old girl had swelling and pain in the throat, nasal polyps, alternating chills and fevers, and frequent urination that became pale over time. This indicated liver abscess symptoms, initially treated with a modified Xiao Yao San, adding stir-fried black Xiao Long Dan.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child had an issue at the left ear&#39;s hairline, which gradually spread upwards causing itching. This was due to heat and toxins in the liver and gallbladder meridians. The treatment used was Chaihu Qinggan San, and both mother and child took it and recovered. Later, without caution regarding rich foods, it recurred, with pus and water dripping and redness on the right cheek. This was due to heat in the stomach meridian. Initially, Qingwei San was used to clear the stomach, and then Chaihu Qinggan San was administered to treat the liver fire. Both mother and child received treatment, additionally using Lixiao San and Niuhuang Jiedu Wan, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A child experienced swelling in the jaw without color change and had constipation, indicating虚热 in the stomach meridian. The treatment was Wuwai Yigong San with added Shengma and Chaihu, leading to recovery. When the wet nurse consumed alcohol and became angry, both jaws became red and swollen, leading to increased coldness and fever. Two doses of Jiawei Qingwei San and one dose of Jiawei Xiaoyao San were used for the mother, and the child also took a few drops, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A child had swelling and pain in the jaw and chin, with pus coming from the inner ear, which had not healed for a long time.

<p>A child developed a lump above the left eyebrow, initially the size of a bean, which grew to the size of a chestnut and became necrotic and painful. This indicated fire dryness in the liver meridian and a blood condition. The treatment involved Jiawei Xiaoyao San, and after about a month, the necrotic tissue fell off. Subsequently, Baizhen Tang and previous medications led to recovery.</p>
<p>A child had pus flowing from the ear, a lump in the neck, and symptoms affecting the eyes, such as being stuck or red and painful. Additionally, the child experienced itching or red urination.

<p>A seven-year-old girl had a polyp in her nose. After applying a toxic medicine, it turned into a sore and became swollen and painful.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child experienced swelling and pain in the knees after a smallpox infection, indicating deficiency in the spleen and kidneys leading to toxic fluid accumulation. Initially, four doses of Lifesaving Decoction were given, resulting in a significant reduction of swelling and pain. Following that, a restorative formula to replenish energy was used, along with Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill, resulting in a complete recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had swelling and ulceration in the legs, with continual discharge of pus and internal heat causing fatigue and weight loss, indicating further damage to the spleen and stomach. Six doses of the Eight-Treasure Decoction and Six-Flavor Pills were administered, and after more than three months, the child recovered.</p>
<p>A child presented with dense smallpox, first suffering from pus-filled lesions on the limbs that healed, but later developed oral thrush, affecting the gums. One dose each of Large Wormwood Decoction and Lifesaving Decoction was given, followed by Clear Stomach Powder with Rhinoceros Horn and Toad Pills for recovery. Afterward, the child experienced fever and thirst, along with mouth pain; Toad Pills were administered, and Yellow Powder was rubbed on the philtrum for comfort.</p>
<p>A child with rashes experienced pain, fever, and thirst, wishing to take a cooling drink. Upon pulse examination, it was noted that the pulse was weak and did not count distinctly, indicating that the evil was in the meridians and thus should not be treated with purgatives. Consequently, two doses of Detoxification and Wind Prevention Decoction were administered, resulting in recovery. This condition often occurs in children, requiring careful examination to distinguish between surface and internal ailments and the severity of the evil for treatment. Wang Haizang stated: &quot;Why should both the beginning and end not be purged?&quot; The answer is: &quot;The beginning should not be purged because the rash has not yet appeared on the surface, and purging would prevent the evils from fully manifesting. This pulse condition shows a presence at the surface without internal conditions, so purging the beginning is prohibited. The end should not be purged because the rash toxins are already evident externally, with no roots or solid foundation internally; if the bowel movement is not substantial and there are no other internal conditions, purging would cause the rash to sink, thus it is forbidden to purge at the end.&quot;<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A child experiences itching and fever. A dose of disinfected rhinoceros horn is given, causing vomiting and diarrhea. This expels the pathogenic Qi both up and down, and the poison resolves on its own. After a while, both vomiting and diarrhea cease, and the rash dissipates. After the vomiting and diarrhea, the pulse shows seven beats—this is the pulse of a peaceful child, indicating the evil has been eradicated, and there is no need for further treatment to cure the rash. </p>
<p>Jie Gu states: In the case of rashes and spots, the symptoms vary. If there is redness and swelling on the surface, it belongs to the lesser yang and the triple burner’s fire, referred to as “spots.” If there are small red dots beneath the skin that do not surface, this pertains to the lesser yin and the imperial fire, called “rashes.” In general, for evident spot conditions, if there is self-induced vomiting and diarrhea, one must be cautious not to treat indiscriminately, for this indicates the pathogenic Qi is expelled both up and down. </p>
<p>When spots and rashes manifest together, children are often unable to withstand this; hence, it can develop into other symptoms. The beginning and end should not be treated lightly. Generally, there are many medications that stabilize the interior and few that promote external release. It is essential to gently guide the Qi, preventing blockage, and allow it to exit in sequence, making it easier for the child to withstand. A warm body is treated with soothing methods, while a cool body requires stimulating treatment.<a id="trans-230p" href="#orig-230p" class="marker">[230p]</a></p></div>

This condition is due to venomous hot blood accumulating in the vital gate, igniting when encountering internal fire. If it resembles scattered clouds, the bad blood must be drained for recovery. If there is swelling and redness that is unstable, one should first apply fresh hemp oil to the affected area, then perform acupuncture to release the poison. Any condition that starts from the limbs and enters the abdomen should not be treated. Although there are several varieties of pills and methods of treatment, none are as effective as acupuncture.

Treatment with the Four Divine Pill, Six Gentlemen Decoction, ginger, and cinnamon gradually yielded improvement, followed by the intermittent use of Qi Tonic Decoction leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had a long-standing anal abscess that did not heal, accompanied by diarrhea, a yellowed face, and cold hands and feet with a heavy sensation in the lower abdomen. This is a severe manifestation of weakened spleen qi and its descent. In the morning, a Qi Tonic Decoction was administered containing five qian of ginseng and two qian of white atractylodes; in the evening, a modified Yigong Powder was given with three qian of ginseng and two qian of white atractylodes. Additionally, ginseng (one liang) was decocted in place of tea. After more than two months, the child recovered. At seventeen, after marriage, the child suffered from anal abscess and diarrhea, with cold hands and feet—nearly life-threatening. I diagnosed it as weakened fire at the mingmen, treating it with Eight Flavor Pill and Qi Tonic Decoction leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child had flowing sores that, after breaking, caused diarrhea and difficulty in digesting food. I attributed it to weak spleen qi and treated it with Six Gentlemen Decoction, leading to recovery. However, after resuming food, diarrhea persisted, and cold hands and feet were noted. Using Six Gentlemen Decoction along with ginger and cinnamon was ineffective, so I used one liang of ginseng and five qian of aconite in several doses, leading to a gradual reduction of symptoms. Then, a month of using Ginseng Decoction resulted in complete recovery.</p>
<p>A young child had scrofula and diarrhea, with a cyanotic face and abdominal bloating. Close examination revealed that the mother&#39;s nipple and breast were painful, indicating that the breast belongs to the stomach and the nipple to the liver. This indicates that the liver wood was overpowering the spleen earth. The child’s illness was directly related to this condition, indicating a shared affliction with the mother. In the morning, Qi Tonic Decoction was used; in the evening, Six Gentlemen Decoction along with licorice and Bupleurum served as the main treatment, supplemented by Four Ingredients Tonic Pill. Both mother and child took the medicine together and recovered.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child suffered from tuberculosis and, after taking a toxic medicine, experienced fever, anxiety, thirst, and vomiting. This indicated further damage to the vital energy. I used Ba Zhen Decoction, increasing the doses of ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes, which gradually brought relief; I also used Si Jun Decoction, angelica, and Cimicifuga to help stabilize the condition.</p>
<p>Another child had tuberculosis with diarrhea, and after taking a purgative, had difficulty urinating, a yellow face, and poor appetite. I diagnosed this as due to deficiency of the spleen and lungs, which were unable to distribute energy to the organs. In the morning, I used an energy-boosting decoction, and in the evening, I used Yi Gong Powder, which resolved all symptoms.</p>
<p>In another case, a young child had tuberculosis accompanied by diarrhea, a pale face, and abdominal distension. This was due to spleen deficiency and liver transgression. I primarily used Yi Gong Powder, with Si Wei Fat Child Pills as a supplement, and the symptoms gradually improved; ultimately, I switched to using Fat Child Pills as the main treatment, with Yi Gong Powder as a supplement, which led to recovery.</p>
<p>Another child had a persistent sore on the buttocks that had not healed for a long time, accompanied by diarrhea, irregular urination, fever, and thirst. I suspected that the kidneys, which open to the two lower orifices, were the cause of the urinary irregularity, resulting from deficiency of kidney energy leading to heat. I used local treatments such as Di Huang Pill and energy-boosting decoction, which gradually alleviated the main symptoms, helped the flesh grow back, and the sore healed itself.</p>
<p>In yet another case, a young child had tuberculosis combined with diarrhea, appearing thin and weak. This was a case of liver and spleen deficiency. After giving three doses of Yi Gong Powder and one dose of Kema Pills, the child recovered within a month.<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young boy of fifteen had developed an interest in women but suffered from an ailment. He took Xuan San for a long time without improvement. I suggested he should strongly replenish his vital energy, but he did not believe me, resulting in severe chills and fever, occasional thirst with phlegm, dizziness, and warmth in his extremities. Afterward, both his urine and stools caused him pain, and his body became stiff. I attributed this to a deficiency of essence and blood, leading to loss. I treated him with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang and Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan, and advised him to take two taels of ginseng brewed as tea instead of water daily. He recovered in three months.</p>
<p>Another boy, aged nine, complained of leg pain. I applied a scallion compress and administered a large dose of Fang Feng Tang. As swelling and redness developed, I alternated between Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, which gradually reduced the swelling. I also used Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang in alternation with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang. Every two to three days, I applied a scallion compress, and after more than two months, the swelling completely subsided.</p>
<p>A different boy suffered from a non-stop ulcer, experienced fatigue, had a reduced appetite, felt dry and feverish, especially worsening in the afternoon. This indicated severe deficiency of the spleen qi. I administered five doses of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to replenish his vital energy and added one dose of Da Fang Feng Tang to treat his ulcer. After more than a month, all symptoms disappeared, and I then used Shi Quan Da Bu Tang combined with Da Fang Feng Tang to aid recovery.</p>
<p>Another boy had a non-healing ulcer, intermittent chills and fevers, and reddish, painful urination, indicative of blood and qi deficiency. I used Shi Quan Da Bu Tang, adding Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei Zi, and all symptoms rapidly receded.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman suffers from pain in her left leg, taking remedies like Liuqi drink; her left knee is swollen and hard, with phlegm and coughing. I believe this to be &quot;crane knee wind.&quot; Her pulse is taut and rapid with little strength, indicating a deficiency in the liver, spleen, and kidney channels. Both the physical and energetic aspects are deficient; thus, we should primarily nourish the spleen and stomach. If one doubts this and continues to expel the pathogenic qi, various symptoms will arise. Initially, I used Wuwei Yigong San with added Shengma, Ganjiang, and Rougui to strengthen the spleen qi a bit; then I used Yigong San and Bajian Tang, which led to an improvement; finally, I intermittently took Dafengfeng Tang and Dihuang Wan, resulting in a complete recovery.</p>
<p>A child experiences gradual swelling in both knees, treated with detoxifying medicines, but his legs and shins are red and swollen. This indicates a deficiency of the father&#39;s kidney qi; I utilized Dihuang Bajian Tang to alleviate the swelling. If detoxifying and pest-repelling medicines are used, it will certainly lead to a worsening condition.</p>
<p>Another child, aged fifteen, had a leg abscess that was healing but then developed diarrhea. I prescribed Buzhong Yiqi Tang and Liu Junzi Tang, and he recovered. Later, due to overexertion and irregular eating, the diarrhea returned. I believed his stomach qi had not yet recovered and continued the previous treatment. If one doubts this and instead takes diarrhea-inducing medicine, the diarrhea will not cease and may lead to demise. The stomach qi must be harmonious; when food enters the stomach, the essence is transported to the spleen and then rises to the lungs, circulating through the hundred vessels to create nourishment and defense. If food intake is improper and daily routines are mismanaged, it damages the stomach qi, causing the essence to descend and resulting in diarrhea. Without uplifting yang and replenishing qi, a cure is impossible.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a></p></div>

<p>One child experienced tidal fevers from the late afternoon until midnight, had a rash all over resembling scabies, suffered from constipation and red, painful urine, and had a craving for cold drinks.

<p>For children whose sores do not heal or recur, it is often due to the mother consuming roasted, spicy foods, or because there is heat in the body.

<p>A child suffers from variola and has discomfort; upon pressing, the symptoms recur. This is due to swelling and pain from the pus. It is then punctured to remove the pus, leading to healing.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Essential Experience Manual&quot; states: A young child with a foot injury feels pain, but the flesh color remains unchanged, indicating that the injury is in the bone. Regularly applying fried scallions relieves it, and at dawn, taking the Blood-Regulating Pain-Reducing Pills helps alleviate the pain. During the day, taking tonics for the spleen and stomach to promote qi and blood is beneficial. After several days, taking Di Huang Pills leads to recovery in over three months.</p>
<p>A young child had a dislocated arm bone that became swollen, painful, and hot. Taking medications for qi flow proves very helpful, but there was little appetite. I applied scallions to relieve the pain immediately; then treated it with Liu Jun Zi Decoction, Astragalus, Bupleurum, Platycodon, Dipsacus, and Fracture Bone to help digestion and reduce swelling. Afterward, I used a formula to tonify the middle and enhance qi, adding wheat and five flavors, which harmonized qi and blood, causing the heat to retreat and resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A young child suffered a sprain, with swollen legs and ankles, feeling weak and timid. I wanted to primarily treat it with tonics for qi and blood, supplemented by dispersing agents. However, he insisted on taking the qi flow drink internally and applying cooling herbs externally, which caused a tiring combination of cold and heat. I stated that the intense chills and fever, along with a very broad pulse, indicated severe qi and blood deficiency, leading to ineffective treatment. Eventually, he lost all yang qi and blood due to internal depletion.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; states: A young child had red rashes on the arm; upon using a stone to draw out the toxic blood, he recovered. Confused by others&#39; words, he took Hu Xin Powder to prevent future issues. After taking it, he experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal bloating, while the affected area turned red again, with cold hands and feet. I diagnosed this as weakness in the spleen and stomach, compounded by the previous medicine&#39;s harm.

I said: If swelling occurs first followed by pain, it’s a structural injury affecting energy; if pain occurs first and then swelling, it’s energy injuring the structure. One should replenish the Yang energy. If you don’t believe this and continue to use laxative medicine, the result may be fatal. &quot;Essentials&quot; state: When the Qi of nourishment and defense is full but unable to move, it stagnates, causing blockage of Qi and blood, and rotting into abscesses—this should be released to neutralize the heat. If a person has poor appetite, weak spirit, and weak vital energy with thin muscles, the Qi of nourishment and defense becomes constricted and stagnated; therefore, cold can penetrate the pores and cause abscesses, which should be treated by strengthening the weak energy. Indeed, this is true.<a id="trans-251p" href="#orig-251p" class="marker">[251p]</a></p></div>

After taking disinfectant medicine for a long time, the condition worsened, and their vital energy diminished. The mother, whose liver and spleen blood were deficient and had heat due to pent-up anger, was treated with a modified Gui Pi decoction as the primary remedy, supplemented with a modified Xiao Yao powder. The mother&#39;s heat gradually subsided; the child was given several spoonfuls daily, and after more than two months, the child recovered.</p>
<p>Another child, since infancy, had four lumps on the neck. By age five, there were lumps in front of and behind the ears, with extremely deficient vital energy, alternating cold and heat, and trouble drinking milk. This was attributed to stagnation in the liver and gallbladder channels. Eight Treasure Decoction and Xiao Yao powder were used, both commonly taken by robust women, and the child drank their milk. After half a year, the child gradually became stronger, and the lumps began to dissipate. The child also took Di Huang pills and Xiao Yao powder and was completely healed.</p>
<p>A child had three lumps on the neck, and the intention was to apply medicine, but the condition extended to the front of the ears. I believed this was caused by issues in the liver and gallbladder channels. Examining the mother, her liver and gallbladder pulses were still strong and rapid.

Doubting me, they took a specific remedy that resulted in vomiting and diarrhea, leading to death by morning.</p>
<p>Another child had oozing pus and unabsorbed lumps, with increased fever and chill. This indicated deficiency of qi and blood in the liver with accompanying heat. The primary remedy was a Yin-replenishing Eight Treasure Decoction, interspersed with a Clear Liver and Nourish Flourishing Decoction, leading to recovery. Afterward, the child developed new lumps, and the urination was reddish and painful, experiencing evening fevers and thirst.

I used the Eight Precious Decoction with additional ginseng and astragalus for fifty doses, followed by another twenty doses, after which it burst forth. However, the pus was clear and watery, and the flesh did not regenerate, indicating weak spleen Qi. I primarily used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes, assisted by peony, cooked rehmannia, ophiopogon, and schisandra, which restored Qi and blood. Consequently, I administered the Must-Effect Powder once, expelling the toxins and achieving recovery.</p>
<p>Another young boy presented with similar issues and, after taking the medicine administered for treatment, developed chills, fever, and abdominal distension, indicating liver and spleen deficiency syndrome. I first utilized the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder with added bupleurum and ephedra and supplemented it with the Nine-Flavored Aloe Vera Pill, gradually improving the condition. I then employed the Four-Flavored Nourishing Pills and the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder to reduce the symptoms.</p>
<p>A nine-year-old boy suffered from this condition, having a constant greenish complexion, with hard swellings that did not burst, and unchanged flesh color. This indicated liver Qi stagnation transforming into phlegm. I advised that we only need to regulate and nourish the liver and spleen. Doubting my words, the pathology of deficiency surged; he sought my treatment again, still wanting to attack the liver. I remarked: A greenish face indicates liver deficiency, revealing its original color; a whiter complexion signifies lung deficiency; phlegm rising indicates spleen deficiency, which fails to contain it; two tightly closed eyes suggest liver blood deficiency leading to wind. The classic states: the stomach is the root of the five organs; we must first rescue the stomach Qi. I proceeded with the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder, adding ephedra and bupleurum, slightly recuperating the vital energy. In the morning, I administered the Middle-Boosting and Qi-Increasing Decoction, and in the evening, the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder with supplementation from the Nine-Flavored Aloe Vera Pill.

<p>Another child had a lump on the side of his neck, with excessive phlegm causing convulsions, and he took a medicinal formula that dries up phlegm, resulting in cramps in his hands and feet.

After the marriage, he developed lumps between his legs and arms after mistakenly using qi-moving and blood-breaking medicine, resulting in cramps and emaciation, resembling tuberculosis.

Emotional stress can also generate heat. The red, moving lesions are blood driven by wind and heat. If it is due to congenital toxins, use Hua Du Dan (Detoxification Pill); for wind-heat, use Bai Du San (Dispelling Toxins Powder); for frequent baths and warm clothing, use Si Wu Decoction, Lian Qiao (Forsythia), and Shan Zhi Zi (Gardenia); for food-related fevers, use Si Jun Zi Tang (Four Gentlemen Decoction), Chai Hu (Bupleurum), and Shen Qu (Malt); if the wet nurse eats rich foods, add Qing Wei San (Clearing the Stomach Powder); if the wet nurse has stagnant heat, use Jia Wei Xiao Yao San (Modified Happy Wanderer Powder).

If it arises from the abdomen and spreads to the limbs, it is mild; if it starts from the limbs and collects in the abdomen, it is severe. Urgent treatment can save the child. The child’s red rash is indeed caused by accumulated heat, known as fetal toxins. This may occur when the mother during pregnancy indulges in spicy and toxic foods, bathes in hot water, or uses charcoal in winter, causing heat to enter the womb due to excessive desires. Sometimes, the child is born into a heated environment, either from warm bedding or heated clothing, leading to an offensive heat and toxin attacking from within and without. Around six months of age, all children show symptoms. At first, there is a fever; upon inspection, the skin appears red, and the child cries incessantly, the rash seeming to shift locations. Rashes on the limbs are survivable, while those on the waist and abdomen predict danger. Urgently use a special magnet or needle to draw out the toxic blood from below upwards, allowing the poisoned blood to flow out. Do not apply the needle in reverse; instead, use powdered frankincense, mixing it with egg white for a uniform paste to apply where needed, and occasionally use juice from banana roots for application. Internally, take a detoxifying pill made with vermilion, mixing it with honey, and subsequently take a drink made from water-ground gold bars. If the rash appears on the head, how should one treat it? The child must sleep on a bed with one end raised using bricks, allowing the toxic vapors to flow out from the head. Use magnetic needles to expel both the toxic gases and blood from the crown. If a wet nurse holds the child while applying needles, the toxins will descend, possibly obstructing the throat, making survival difficult. Careful observation of fellow practitioners shows many fail in their techniques and cause harm to children.

Shengma Decoction possesses a spicy and warm flavor. The \"Inner Canon\" states that heat is produced by accumulated warmth, which is termed heavy fire; it should only be treated with cooling herbs that are spicy in nature. If encountered at normal times, spicy warmth may be applied, as there is usually no urgent issue. However, it is necessary to carefully examine the state of the illness; in severe cases, spicy warmth is also unsuitable. After a dispersal, one should use Liangge Powder combined with Angelica and Baihu Decoction, or Huadan Decoction, or Yulu Powder for decoction. For even more severe cases, detoxifying decoctions and regulating stomach powders should be applied. The ancients said: \"Rashes and sores, both at the beginning and end, should not be purged,\" which is erroneous. Do we not know that pouring water to stop boiling is inferior to removing the firewood from beneath the pot? The \"Inner Canon\" states: “In the years of the fifth yin and the fifth shen, this illness occurs frequently, primarily due to the yang fire of Shaoyang.” Furthermore, it is noted that when Shaoyang's external energy prevails, hives and rashes manifest on the exterior. Additionally, all pain-related ailments and sores are attributed to heart fire. Wang Taifu further stated that all maladies stem from the heart. How can one rashly apply spicy warmth to disperse? If the heat intensifies, it may lead to internal toxins and blood loss, resulting in severe symptoms such as grinding teeth and convulsions; this indicates significant heat."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"Like the white tiger combined with ginseng, and the Cooling the Diaphragm Powder added with Angelica and Platycodon, do not ask about autumn and winter; just see the sores and rashes, it works effectively. For children with sores, hives, grain rashes, red swellings, and blotch toxins, if there is internal poison leading to bleeding. The Inner Canon states: if the minor yang's guest qi prevails, then the red swellings and rashes appear externally. This is because residual heat has not been resolved, thus leading to internal poison and bleeding. Treat it with Huanglian Jiedu Decoction, White Tiger Decoction, and Cooling the Diaphragm Powder, selecting according to the clinical presentation. The so-called white tiger is traditionally said not to be used in autumn and winter, but that is a mistake. It can be used whenever there is this symptom, for it belongs to the fire of the corresponding organs. For children with red swollen tumors with toxic heat spreading throughout the body, it indicates the poison of pathogenic heat. You can use magnet pieces to draw out the purple blood, and the illness will immediately improve. If it does not heal, later use Cooling the Diaphragm Powder combined with Rhubarb and Glauber's Salt for a good effect; next, use the Poison Cleansing Powder to wash out three to five times for guaranteed recovery. The classic says: red swellings and tumors of the fire color are governed by the fire of the corresponding organs. For children with sudden red swellings, you can first use Niuhuang Tongge Wan to purge it, then apply Yangqishi San for the swelling and poison to dissipate by itself; if it does not, you can use a (Jinfei) needle to puncture, letting blood flow out to ensure recovery."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"**Ulcers and Skin Conditions** For children with ulcers, scabies, or skin lesions, you can use a mixture of realgar powder with a little bit of mirabilite, mixed with oil for application. If there are sores or lesions on the face, it’s not advisable to apply medicine, for fear of it getting into the eyes, which could result in damage to vision. **Boils and Tumors** When children experience red tumors and swellings that cause continuous pain, the \"Inner Canon\" states that all pains and itchy sores are due to heart fire, and a specific incantation can be used to suppress it. The method involves a mental focus, and the incantation goes as follows: \"Dragon spirits flow, all toxic swellings; sores with pus and blood are causing pain; forget the mind, recite the Great Compassion Mantra, and the toxins will dissipate.\" Repeat the incantation three times, while facing the sun, moon, or a light source, take a breath, and blow it onto the swollen tumors. With the right hand, make a gentle gathering and compressing motion over the sores three times, while keeping the left hand still. Each breath should be followed by three gentle gathers and compresses, with no taboos to worry about. When using this method, ensure your mind is focused. This method comes from my ancestor, Han, and has been passed down for over a hundred years, successfully helping countless people. If the patient does not consume meat or alcohol, the method becomes even more effective. Those suffering from sores and swellings should avoid warm and moving foods like chicken, pork, fish, and rabbit.

Children often suffer from stasis of the heart qi leading to sores and abscesses, which result from excessive intake while in the womb. This is a principle that must be addressed. Children, before they are able to see or think, have no means to feel such stasis in their hearts. Ancient sages stated that infants often have much dampness and heat due to prenatal excess; also, when the fetus is being formed, the parents’ qi and blood may be imbalanced in cold and heat, leading to numerous illnesses in their offspring. In particular, as their bodies are not yet sturdy and their membranes are delicate, any slight disturbance should be addressed rigorously. I once saw a person who had suffered from long-term cough illness. After recovery, he had a son who, at three months old, developed a fever and a boil appeared under the right armpit between the yangming and shaoyang areas. As this abscess healed, another one formed under the left armpit, oozing pus and blood with no signs of recovery. The physician Wang Shoufu treated him with Siwu Decoction and Baidu San, adding ginseng, using xiangfu to assist and rhinoceros horn as the main ingredient, feeding the mother for two months, after which the child was stable. After three months, he suddenly developed abdominal swelling and a red rash resembling clouds. Juices from cut grass were mixed with silkworm droppings and applied to it, leading to gradual disappearance. Half a month later, the swelling moved into the capsule, becoming a lump that looked concerning. After two days, the capsule burst, revealing two masses that discharged clear fluid. Using perilla leaves to hold fine charcoal powder, it took about ten days for the condition to heal. It must be understood that the prolonged illness of the father likely caused the mother to have worries and anger, exacerbating the remaining heat and toxins from the cough, leading to this situation. — From \"Treasures of Health\" 【Yuan Dynasty, Luo Tianyi】"},{"anchor":"trans-9p","marker":"9p","type":"translation","text":"**Eyebrow Refinement** The refinement of the eyebrow in children is called eyebrow refinement on the face, it is referred to as zjier in the ears, and as shoe itch in the feet.

Externally, Yiyuan is pasted on, and cold water is similarly employed. Within three to five days, urgent measures should be taken, for surprises may arise akin to dreams. The treatment of dan follows a certain order, starting from the head and laying out each step. Dissolving the exterior and using detoxifying agents comes first, followed by inserting qīzhēn. If qīzhēn is inconvenient, one should urgently use acupuncture needles. Then apply medicinal ointments to save the child, a method established by predecessors. The swift method requires detoxification first, or employing purgative medicines to relieve blockage. At the onset, do not aggressively attack; poisons lurking within must be expelled.

Many newborns are afflicted by fetal toxicity-related ailments. For instance, issues such as umbilical wind or stubborn phlegm coughs can be difficult to treat; if a child has true convulsions at six months, that is ominous, while those with sores before a week are likely to die. Moreover, newborns have delicate stomachs and intestines, their blood and qi are insufficient, making it hard to introduce herbs or stones, and their defenses are weak with underdeveloped meridians, making acupuncture challenging. Practitioners should exercise caution! When asked about the concept of fetal toxicity, I replied: the wise have discussed it thoroughly.

The most severe cases involve stagnation in the blood vessels, manifesting as lesions on the skin. If one restricts the flow of vital energy and blood, it can easily rupture; if it becomes entangled in wind, it leads to severe itching; or if external pathogens enter, it often causes widespread itching without resolution. Food toxins can stagnate and impair the blood and vital energy, eventually transforming into pus over time. Shock-induced ulcers derive from a mental disturbance with no tangible cause, causing a blockage of blood and energy in the organs, leading to skin eruptions that spread throughout the body, particularly affecting the limbs.

Each bump swells first and then suppurates. Mild cases can heal, while severe ones are difficult to treat. If the kernels leak pus for many years without drying up, it is referred to as \"Leaky Neck.\" The initial occurrence of the disease results from the three Yang patterns receiving wind and heat, which clash with blood and qi.

According to Wan's \"Young Child Explanation,\" a small child had a red rash on his face, with swollen eyes, and could not be approached. He died after three days. A small child had numerous boils on his head, experiencing chills and pain during summer, with symptoms fully manifesting. First, a dose of Ren Shen Bai Du San, augmented with Huang Lian and Xiang Ru was given, which immediately relieved the pain; next, Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin was administered. Within three doses, the larger boils purged pus, while the smaller ones resolved on their own. After consuming rich food again, symptoms recurred, which required Qing Wei San and Huo Ming Yin to be taken once each to cure him. A small child had swelling and pain in his head and face, which was attributed to heat toxin in the stomach channel. Initially, Xian Fang Huo Ming Yin was used, followed by Qing Wei San, leading to recovery. Later, ulcers appeared on the tongue, requiring topical application of powdered medicine, and he experienced severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and lack of appetite, with cold extremities. I diagnosed it as spleen and stomach deficiency with cold, treated with Yi Gong San augmented with Sheng Ma, resulting in recovery. A small child, over ten days old, had a sizeable poisonous sore on his head with a red halo, and the situation was critical. During treatment, black blood was drawn with a guillotine needle, causing the child to feel secure. The following day, he developed a similar condition between his eyebrows, which also exhibited a red halo. I believed immediate treatment with the needle was necessary, but the consensus was to wait until the second day for treatment. Ultimately, the blood clotted and could not be drawn, leading to abdominal bloating and death."},{"anchor":"trans-217p","marker":"217p","type":"translation","text":"A young child suffered from heat毒 (toxic heat) on the face, and after taking medicine to clear the stomach, the swelling and pain worsened. I thought the toxic energy was excessive and the blood stagnation had not subsided, so I used the Immortal Life Restoring Drink twice, and the child recovered. Later, due to food injury, experiencing morning chills and evening heat, the face again suffered this ailment. After taking fire-reducing medicine, the mouth and tongue became red and swollen, and the hands and feet were cold. I believed the stomach energy was again damaged and turned to cold, so I used the Five Flavor Distinctive Powder and the child recovered. Another child was born with a body covered in itchy rashes and enjoyed being rubbed and patted. I prepared a prescription: using black snake wine, soak and roast to obtain one qian (about three grams) of meat; soak and roast two qian of bitter onion wine; stir-fried sesame seeds and stir-fried white thistle, each one qian and five fen (about five grams total). I combined these into a powder, mixed the soaked snake and bitter onion wine into a paste to form pills, and administered them with licorice soup, leading to recovery. A five-year-old boy developed pus-filled blisters all over his body every spring, which was a fetal toxin. I advised avoiding topical medicines, fearing that powdered arsenic and sulfur toxins could enter the belly through weaknesses. Instead, I treated him with sesame seed pills and he recovered. Additionally, I applied moxibustion to Fengchi, Xuechi, Quuchi, and Sanli points, and thereafter, he never had a recurrence. The daughter of the Wang family, aged four, had a lump behind her ear. When asked, I stated: it is not a sore but a phlegm nodule. There is no need for treatment, as it is not harmful. Under the misguidance of another doctor, she was treated as if it were a sore, taking excessive medicine made from the prickly pear inside, which harmed her spleen and stomach, leading to illness and death—how tragic! Another child developed swollen, hard, and painful lumps near the front of the ear, commonly known as mumps. I applied the Detoxifying Powder, and it was remarkably effective."},{"anchor":"trans-218p","marker":"218p","type":"translation","text":"A child suffered from sores in the mouth, and the doctor applied various medicines such as ge gen, lian, zhi, and bo, but to no avail. I said it was caused by heat in the heart, and the bitter herbs would only aggravate that heat; hence it was ineffective. I then created a \"washing heart powder\" for them, which provided relief after one dose. My nephew had sores all over his mouth, throat, lips, and tongue, prompting me to prescribe medicine. I formulated a prescription using three grams each of bo he and lian, five grams of red mercury and white alum, and three grams of dried pillbug, grinding it finely; it worked immediately, which was remarkable. The \"Family Compilation on Smallpox\" by the Wan family states: After a small child's smallpox scabs fall off, the scars appear white. Someone asked me about this, and I said it indicates qi deficiency. The lungs, being the master of qi, are associated with the color white, so one should use ginseng and astragalus for a strong nourishing formula, or else there could be complications. The person responded, \"The smallpox has already cleared up, how could there be complications?\" One month later, the child suffered from severe wheezing and died. The county magistrate's grandson developed smallpox. After the scabs fell off for over a month, the scars remained swollen, and now they began to discharge. Any toxic condition emerging from within is auspicious; I suggested a mixture of angelica stem, red peony, fang feng, jing jie, lian qiao, burdock seed, black ginseng, cicada shell, and sbeng ma, blended into a powder and infused with a decoction of bamboo leaves to adjust and take for relief. A child had the scabs fall off, but the scars became swollen and itchy. I was consulted, and I said this was due to wind-heat. I prescribed the ginseng antidote powder added with fang feng and jing jie, and the child felt better after one dose. For others who experienced the same, using the jing jie antidote powder combined with ginseng and bathing in willow broth was effective as well."},{"anchor":"trans-219p","marker":"219p","type":"translation","text":"A young child, after losing scabs, had uneven scars. When asked, I said: The family of smallpox advises against eating ginger, for fear that the marks will not be even. When inquired, it was indeed the case. A young child after losing scabs developed swelling that turned into sores, which did not heal for a long time. They asked me to treat it, and I said: This is a pox toxin sore, caused by the child having picked at it, preventing it from falling off naturally, thus injuring the flesh and causing sores to reappear. I prescribed bitter herb pills, and it healed. In Qishui, after the summer, a child of Nan Changzi developed boils after smallpox; they asked me to check. I saw their complexion was dark, looking tired and weak, and they had little appetite. I said: The child’s smallpox has not matured properly; the scabs were removed too soon. Now the boils are erupting, indicating a deficiency returning to the kidney, likely unable to produce pus and may lead to death. It turned out to be true. Another young child developed boils after smallpox and urgently asked for treatment. I used the Ten Complete Great Nourishing Decoction, adding forsythia and honeysuckle, and treated it to recovery. Since the boils had already burst, this formula was used. Those who had burst boils have all been treated successfully with this. A young child after smallpox developed boils and immediately asked for treatment. I used a detoxifying internal dispersing powder to adjust and they recovered. A young child after smallpox developed a fever, and had difficulty with urination and defecation, with red scars. Other doctors said it was due to deficiency, wanting to use the Baoyuan Decoction. I said: No, this is actual heat! It was caused by eating spicy and hot foods.

At that time, Tang asked me to enter the capital with him, so I invited my fourth son, Bangzhi, and my eighth son, Bangjing, to assist Han Fengqi in treating the pockmarks. Later, a red swelling appeared on his right shoulder, which was not an abscess. Han pricked it with a needle, but he could not lift his hand. At the end of March, Xiaofeng returned north and, upon reaching Shangcai, was greatly worried. I reassured him, saying, \"Do not worry!\" Upon examining him, I found that his hand was not painful but weak and powerless; he could not lift it by himself and had to use his left hand to do so. When Tang asked the reason, I said, \"It is due to liver heat and Qi deficiency.\" The liver governs the tendons, providing blood for nourishment; in cold, it contracts, and in heat, it expands. Only by replenishing Qi and nourishing blood will the illness resolve. So, I prepared a formula using ginseng, astragalus, angelica, ligusticum, white peony root, teasel root, licorice, white atractylodes, balloon flower, cardamom, coix seed, and mifang to make into pills, which he took for half a month and recovered. A small child, after bathing, experienced swelling all over his face and body and asked me to treat him. I replied, \"This is due to water Qi.\" I used the Si Junzi Decoction to strengthen the spleen and remove dampness, added astragalus to bolster the exterior, and used saposhnikovia to counteract the dampness at the muscle surface and ephedra to expel the water from under the skin. After one dose, the swelling reduced.

Dai stated, \"This is lung abscess.\" When he asked the boy's wet nurse if there had been any painful areas, she replied, \"No.\" Dai instructed the boy to remove his clothing and raised both of his arms, observing that the right side of his ribcage was slightly elevated. When Dai pressed on it, the boy moved to avoid the pressure, but did not react to pressure on the left rib. Dai concluded, \"There is an abscess in the lung, and it has already discharged pus.\" After treatment, the boy recovered. One day, Li Shuhe asked Dong Yuan: \"In middle age, I had a son who developed red silk tumors after turning one year old, which were not treated. Subsequently, three or four more sons, before reaching two years old, all suffered from tumors and died. May I ask why this is?\" Dong Yuan replied, \"Let me ponder over it.\" The next day, he met with Shuhe and said, \"I have figured it out. There is concealed fire in your kidneys, and your essence contains much red silk, which is transmitted through qi, resulting in this ailment in your offspring. When disturbed, it manifests in the muscles, commonly referred to as fetal tumors.\" Shuhe examined this and found it was indeed as Dong Yuan described. He then took several doses of Kidney Nourishing Pill to expel the fire evil from his kidneys and to replenish the deficiency of the Heavenly True essence, while avoiding wine, meat, and pungent hot foods. His wife used Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill to nourish her yin blood. After five months of pregnancy, she took a decoction made from Atractylodes and Scutellaria.

I prescribed herbs to soothe the liver and cool the blood, and both mother and child recovered. By the beginning of June, he had vomiting and diarrhea, with reddish urine and twitching eyes. Treatments like ginseng and atractylodes did not respond. Some believed it to be chronic fright. I observed the pulse at the wrists and found it red, indicating wind-heat. A prescription of Chai Hu Qing Gan San with additions of Uncaria and Equisetum was given, and he was cured. In the first month of the year of Ding You, he developed a hot toxic sore on his neck that oozed pus. He caught wind and developed a fever, and his head and face swelled like a melon. Urgently, I needed to perform bloodletting, releasing about three cups of dark blood. I then used a detoxifying herbal decoction, resulting in the swelling subsiding significantly.

Thus, black blood was drawn out, and an application of enhanced Shen Gong San was made. They used honeysuckle and licorice as powder, mixed with human milk for ingestion, and the child recovered. After more than a month, both legs were still swollen and treated as before, leading to healing. A few days later, the legs turned red again. They attempted to use rhinoceros horn to detoxify. The child had no appetite, and the abdomen was distended, once again harming the spleen and stomach. They continued applying the previous medication and took a restorative decoction with added Poria, resulting in recovery. Shen Gong San was effective but caused slight pain at the needled area; using Tai Yi Dan also helped. A young child suffered in the leg, appearing as usual, eating normally. The poison was manifesting on the surface of the skin. I suggested needling to release the poison without the need for medicinal intake. However, they were skeptical, applying cold externally and taking harsh medicines internally, which led to abdominal distension and the child dying from not being able to eat. Cold and cooling agents harm the spleen's energy, while harsh medications damage the vital energy; what other outcome could there be? A young child frequently experienced swelling in both legs resembling toxin, but without blisters. There was excessive phlegm and a red chin. My elder brother believed this stemmed from the kidney's deficient fire and prescribed a formula with Rehmannia root, advising both mother and child to take it, resulting in recovery.

Suddenly, an old woman came and exclaimed, \"This is a red thread sore; it will endanger your life!\" She quickly burned mugwort several times over the blister and pricked the thread in several places, thus saving her. A young boy had five sores on his neck after falling into the grass. Upon examination, his mother was often very angry and frequently had chills and fever, with pains in her chest and slight swelling in her sides, all indicating liver and gallbladder problems. He first used Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Dong Quai and Peony, and the chills and fever immediately subsided. Subsequently, he applied a modified version of the Xiao Yao San, and after two months of treatment for the mother, the child also recovered. Another child suffered due to the heat in his wet nurse's liver channel, having issues in front of and behind his ears. After treating the mother with a modified Xiao Yao San, the child also recovered."},{"anchor":"trans-253p","marker":"253p","type":"translation","text":"A young child had a lump beneath each ear for three years. After taking disinfectant medicine for a long time, the condition worsened, and their vital energy diminished. The mother, whose liver and spleen blood were deficient and had heat due to pent-up anger, was treated with a modified Gui Pi decoction as the primary remedy, supplemented with a modified Xiao Yao powder. The mother's heat gradually subsided; the child was given several spoonfuls daily, and after more than two months, the child recovered. Another child, since infancy, had four lumps on the neck. By age five, there were lumps in front of and behind the ears, with extremely deficient vital energy, alternating cold and heat, and trouble drinking milk. This was attributed to stagnation in the liver and gallbladder channels. Eight Treasure Decoction and Xiao Yao powder were used, both commonly taken by robust women, and the child drank their milk. After half a year, the child gradually became stronger, and the lumps began to dissipate. The child also took Di Huang pills and Xiao Yao powder and was completely healed. A child had three lumps on the neck, and the intention was to apply medicine, but the condition extended to the front of the ears. I believed this was caused by issues in the liver and gallbladder channels. Examining the mother, her liver and gallbladder pulses were still strong and rapid. I concluded that the mother and child were connected, and by treating the mother, the child would naturally heal. Doubting me, they took a specific remedy that resulted in vomiting and diarrhea, leading to death by morning. Another child had oozing pus and unabsorbed lumps, with increased fever and chill. This indicated deficiency of qi and blood in the liver with accompanying heat. The primary remedy was a Yin-replenishing Eight Treasure Decoction, interspersed with a Clear Liver and Nourish Flourishing Decoction, leading to recovery. Afterward, the child developed new lumps, and the urination was reddish and painful, experiencing evening fevers and thirst. The primary treatment was Shen Zhu Zi Ling Decoction, supplemented by Liu Wei Di Huang Wan combined with Chai Hu, Shan Zhi, and Si Wei Fei Er Wan, resulting in recovery."},{"anchor":"trans-254p","marker":"254p","type":"translation","text":"A young boy, fifteen years old, suffered from this condition, experienced fever and thirst, had red cheeks in the evening, and exhibited a weak, rapid pulse, indicating Yin deficiency with heat. I used the Eight Precious Decoction with additional ginseng and astragalus for fifty doses, followed by another twenty doses, after which it burst forth. However, the pus was clear and watery, and the flesh did not regenerate, indicating weak spleen Qi. I primarily used ginseng, astragalus, angelica, and atractylodes, assisted by peony, cooked rehmannia, ophiopogon, and schisandra, which restored Qi and blood. Consequently, I administered the Must-Effect Powder once, expelling the toxins and achieving recovery. Another young boy presented with similar issues and, after taking the medicine administered for treatment, developed chills, fever, and abdominal distension, indicating liver and spleen deficiency syndrome. I first utilized the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder with added bupleurum and ephedra and supplemented it with the Nine-Flavored Aloe Vera Pill, gradually improving the condition. I then employed the Four-Flavored Nourishing Pills and the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder to reduce the symptoms. A nine-year-old boy suffered from this condition, having a constant greenish complexion, with hard swellings that did not burst, and unchanged flesh color. This indicated liver Qi stagnation transforming into phlegm. I advised that we only need to regulate and nourish the liver and spleen. Doubting my words, the pathology of deficiency surged; he sought my treatment again, still wanting to attack the liver. I remarked: A greenish face indicates liver deficiency, revealing its original color; a whiter complexion signifies lung deficiency; phlegm rising indicates spleen deficiency, which fails to contain it; two tightly closed eyes suggest liver blood deficiency leading to wind. The classic states: the stomach is the root of the five organs; we must first rescue the stomach Qi. I proceeded with the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder, adding ephedra and bupleurum, slightly recuperating the vital energy. In the morning, I administered the Middle-Boosting and Qi-Increasing Decoction, and in the evening, the Five-Flavored Unique Function Powder with supplementation from the Nine-Flavored Aloe Vera Pill.

Another child had a lump on the side of his neck, with excessive phlegm causing convulsions, and he took a medicinal formula that dries up phlegm, resulting in cramps in his hands and feet. This was a sign of renewed injury to the liver blood, indicating an urgent convulsion. I thus used a modified Xiao Chai Hu Tang with added Gua Lou, Gardenia, Chuanxiong, and Donggui, and after adding Wuwei and Maidong to Liuwei Wan, he recovered. A child every time frightened would have a lump on his neck, fever, decreased appetite, and slight twitches in his limbs while sleeping; this indicated that the liver wood was harming the spleen earth. I used Wuwei Yigong San with added Chaihu, Shengma, and Gua Lou which led to recovery. After the marriage, he developed lumps between his legs and arms after mistakenly using qi-moving and blood-breaking medicine, resulting in cramps and emaciation, resembling tuberculosis. I examined the situation upon arrival in the capital, used Dihuang Wan to nourish liver and kidney blood, and supplemented with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to replenish spleen and lung qi, leading to recovery. A child had lumps in front of and behind his ears; upon being startled would produce excessive phlegm, grind his teeth, and have convulsions, shaking his head. He took a drying medicine, which led to chronic fright and eventual death. A child with smallpox healed as expected, but the scars were red like ochre. I believed the wet nurse had heat in her body.
