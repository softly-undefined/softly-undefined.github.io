      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p><strong>Collection of Medical Works from Ancient and Modern Times, Volume 415</strong></p>
<p><strong>Children’s Diseases of the Lips, Mouth, Teeth, Tongue, and Throat</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions</strong> (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)</p>
<p><strong>Oral Thrush</strong></p>
<p>If a young child exhibits oral thrush upon emerging from the womb, their tongue will have white flakes like rice; in severe cases, these flakes may also be found in the nose. This condition arises from excessive intake of dampness from grains while in the womb, or due to the mother&#39;s craving for glutinous rice during pregnancy. To treat it, cover the head with a cloth, dab it with well water, and clean it for three days; it should then clear up. If it doesn’t, boil the juice of the chestnut&#39;s inner skin until thick, and use a cloth to dab it. In spring and summer, if chestnut inner skin is not available, you can boil the bark of the chestnut tree, applying the same method with well water.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>Tongue with Membrane</h3>
<p>When a small child is born with a connected tongue, beneath the tongue there is a membrane resembling the partition of a pomegranate. This membrane connects the tongue underneath, preventing the child from speaking or moving the tongue. It can be clipped with nails, resulting in a small amount of bleeding which is not harmful; if the bleeding does not stop, it can be cauterized until it becomes ash and applied to stop the bleeding.</p>
<h3>Thick Palate and Gums</h3>
<p>When a child is six or seven days old, the blood and qi consolidate into flesh, and the mouth, tongue, throat, and cheeks become clear. If there is something in the throat or on the tongue that resembles a water-filled reed or if there are bulging abscesses, a long needle can be wrapped with cotton, with the blade left about the size of a grain of millet, to pierce it and release the qi, expelling the blue, yellow, or red blood fluid. After one puncture, if swelling remains, it can be punctured again the next day, not exceeding three punctures to completely eliminate it. If any small remnants remain, three punctures are also sufficient for them to dissipate naturally. The condition under the tongue is called &quot;thick tongue,&quot; if it is found in the cheeks and hard palate, it is called &quot;thick palate,&quot; and if it is found on the gums, it is called &quot;thick gums.&quot; All of these should have their blood fluid punctured. After puncturing, rinse with salt and immediately apply a sacred powder or a fine powdered remedy.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Tooth Diseases</strong></p>
<p>In general, the exposure of the gums is often due to deficiencies (with pests hidden above and below) and lunar eclipses. Apply the ash of the horsetail at night between the gums to fill the spaces; avoid eating oils, and within two or three days, it will heal. Consuming oils and dried jujubes will provoke the issue. Therefore, those suffering from dental problems should avoid oils, dried jujubes, and cassia bark. Every morning, take a pinch of salt in your mouth, swish with warm water, and rub and tap your teeth a hundred times; do this without fail, and within five days, the teeth will be firmly set. Generally, those who cannot eat fruits and vegetables have exposed tooth roots. This method of using saltwater to clean and tap the teeth is universally effective and excellent. The tendency to suffer from dental diseases often arises from eating or drinking during lunar eclipses, so knowledgeable individuals should be especially cautious. Thus, during lunar eclipses, one should strictly avoid food and drink. The same advice applies to children.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment for Children: Playing with the Tongue</h3>
<p>Playing with the tongue indicates a slight heat in the spleen, causing the tongue&#39;s veins to become tight, necessitating frequent warmth and relaxation. One should minimize the use of Yellow Powder. If a child drinks water but has a weak spleen and stomach with reduced fluids, accompanied by a pale face, thin body, and irritability with heat in the five hearts, it indicates malnutrition; here, take Hu Huanglian pills. If the playing with the tongue occurs during a serious illness, it is ominous.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The term &quot;playing with the tongue&quot; refers to a tongue that slightly protrudes and then retracts, indicative of deficiency in the heart and spleen, which should be treated with a warming spleen powder. If the tongue is stretched out and slowly retracts while protruding, it suggests accumulated heat in the heart and spleen, for which Yellow Powder should be minimized. If there are sores on the mouth and tongue with thirst for cold drinks, it indicates excessive heat in the stomach channel, requiring Yellow Powder. If there is a thirst accompanied by aversion to cold, it signifies deficiency heat in the stomach channel, to be treated with the Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is little food intake with thirst, or loose stools, indicating weakness in the spleen and stomach, use the Seven-Flavored Atractylodes Powder. If there is drooling from the corners of the mouth or swelling in the cheeks, it may indicate spleen deficiency with wind heat, initially using Ren Shen An Wei Powder, followed by the Seven-Flavored Atractylodes Powder. If symptoms are severe in the afternoon, it suggests deficiency of spleen blood, thus the Four Substances Decoction should include more ginseng, atractylodes, and poria. One should not use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction without first assessing compatibility. For malnutrition symptoms, refer to the relevant malnutrition guidelines.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>If one is urgently wanting to suckle but cannot due to a thick tongue and dry lips, it is a sign that wind pathogenic factors have accumulated heat in the heart and spleen, leading to this condition. </p>
<p>Note: If the symptoms stem from external pathogens causing tightness in the lips and mouth, it is known as &quot;navel wind,&quot; which is often difficult to treat. If there is heat in the heart and spleen, leading to pain at the tip of the tongue that prevents sucking, or pain affecting the base of the tongue that hinders milk flow, apply a powder of willow blossoms. If the underside of the tongue is swollen like a small tongue, or if there is pain due to tension in the tongue veins or problems with the gums presenting white spots, use a fine needle to draw out toxic blood, and also apply the aforementioned powder. If the lips are swollen and painful, or if there are painful cracks, mix angelica ointment with the powder for application. If a severe illness causes fever and thirst for cold drinks, along with constipation, use a purging formula to relieve the heat. If the illness has left one with a fever, thirst for soup, and loose stools, use a formula to nourish the stomach qi.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>If one takes a decoction for attacking and invading factors, along with vomiting or abdominal pain, it harms the spleen and stomach; use the Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is drooling from the mouth or phlegm obstructing, indicating that the spleen cannot contain, use the Six Gentlemen Decoction. If a child eats sweet and fatty foods, or if the mother consumes wine or flour, resulting in sores on the child&#39;s mouth and tongue, use the Clear Stomach Powder to eliminate heat. If there are vomiting and reduced appetite with diarrhea, use the Atractylodes Powder to tonify the spleen. If the hands and feet are cold, or there is abdominal pain with aversion to cold, use the Six Gentlemen with roasted ginger to warm the middle. If a mother&#39;s improper diet and labor cause a fever in the child, use the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction. If the mother has blood deficiency in the liver and gallbladder, transferring internal heat to the child, use the Modified Free and Easy Wanderer Powder and Eight Treasure Decoction. If the mother experiences liver and spleen stagnation with anger, damaging blood and causing internal heat that harms the child, use the Modified Free and Easy Wanderer Powder and Modified Return the Spleen Decoction, both with added reed. The child may also take a few drops. It is necessary to refer back to previous details regarding tongue assessments.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Caring for Parents in the Confucian Way</strong><br><em>By Zhang Congzheng</em></p>
<p><strong>Mouth Sores and Tight Lips</strong></p>
<p>For young children with mouth sores and tight lips, wash away the white crust with sour jujube water, and when in difficulty, sprinkle green robe powder. If it does not improve, apply banquet powder; if it still does not cure, then applying lead white powder will bring recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Tooth Rot</strong></p>
<p>Tooth rot refers to the decay of teeth; this decay is due to the rotting of the gums. The lower teeth correspond to the hand Yangming Large Intestine meridian, which is primarily associated with dryness and metal; the upper teeth correspond to the foot Yangming Stomach meridian, primarily associated with dampness and earth. Together, they are the two meridians of the intestines and stomach. If there is accumulated heat within, or due to the ingestion of toxic medicines like silver powder or large doses of croton, entering the intestines and stomach, milk and food cannot withstand the poison, leading the toxic qi to affect the gums and the delicate gaps between the teeth, causing harm. It can be treated with fragrant jade thread. When a wet nurse is about to sleep, she should take a dose of coptis detoxifying soup, and the tooth rot will be cured.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Wooden Tongue</strong></p>
<p>Dai Yun: Wooden tongue refers to a swollen and hard tongue that lacks the softness of a normal one. A heavy tongue also belongs to this category. Both conditions are generally due to heat illness. Use a powder made from a mix of various herbs like frost, talcum, and Glauber&#39;s salt, and apply it with wine.</p>
<p><strong>Mouth Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Dai Yun: This refers to having sores throughout the mouth. Apply tea from the Jiang region and powdered herbs; alternatively, mix equal parts of苦参 (苦参),黄丹 (yellow orpiment),五倍子 (galla chinensis), and青黛 (indigo) for application.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Treatments by Contemporary Physicians</strong> (Yuan era, Wei Yilin)</p>
<p><strong>Teeth Not Growing</strong></p>
<p>The lack of tooth growth occurs because teeth are nourished by the bone and marrow. If the vital energy is insufficient, the marrow cannot nourish the bones, leading to prolonged absence of teeth. It is advisable to take Xiong Huang San.</p>
<p><strong>Remarkable Treatments</strong> (Ming era, Fang Xian)</p>
<p><strong>Playing with the Tongue</strong></p>
<p>Playing with the tongue indicates slight heat in the spleen, causing the tongue veins to become slightly tense; one should stretch the tongue from time to time. It is crucial not to use cooling medicines for treatment. A little bit of Long Nao Yin Zi and Di Huang Gao should be used. If the condition persists in a serious illness, it is ominous; practitioners should be cautious.</p>
<p><strong>Notes from the Heart</strong> (Ming era, Wan Quan)</p>
<p><strong>Lip Sores</strong></p>
<p>In children with intestinal worms, symptoms include drowsiness, irritability, a foul-smelling nose, gum sores, and black blood in diarrhea. Worms in the lower body cause sores on the lower lip, while those affecting the organs lead to sores on the upper lip.</p>
<p><strong>Hundred Questions about Infants</strong> (Ming era, Lu Boshi)<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Candidiasis (Thrush)</strong></p>
<p>Chao Shi said: The condition called &quot;candidiasis&quot; refers to infants at birth who have white flakes in their mouths, filling their oral cavity like that of a goose, hence the name. This occurs due to heat from the fetus, with the heart and spleen being particularly vigorous, which manifests in the mouth. Ge Shi advised using hair wrapped around the finger to dip in well water and wipe the mouth; at night, burning yellow minerals to extract heat and applying it to the tongue. If the infant has a &quot;fused tongue&quot; with membrane underneath, similar to the partitions in a pomegranate, it may cause difficulty in speaking later on. One can cut it carefully, which may produce a little blood but is not harmful; if the bleeding does not stop, one can burn the hair to ash and apply it to stop the bleeding. </p>
<p>Use the Baoming powder: one qian of dried white alum, half a qian of horse&#39;s tooth nitre, and one fen of vermilion, finely ground together. Take white goose droppings, mix it with water to extract juice, and apply it inside the mouth and on the cheeks. First, use the hair to clean off any filth on the tongue, then apply the medicine. The occurrence of mouth sores is due to the infant having an abundance of blood energy and being overly nourished, causing heat accumulation in the heart, which steams upward, resulting in mouth sores. </p>
<p>One should use powdered southern star herb mixed with light vinegar and apply it to the soles of the feet; wet-nurses should take the Xixin powder while also taking the Xiexin Decoction. For treating the mouth, use powdered huanglian mixed with honey water to apply inside. Huangbo, qingdai, and ice shavings are all effective. Additionally, using a small amount of niuhuang powdered and bamboo juice applied inside the mouth can treat candidiasis. Applying horse&#39;s tooth nitre in a bean-sized amount is also good. If the mouth resembles a fish&#39;s and cannot close, or if it makes crowing sounds, it is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The Nest Family said: Children with a heavy tongue have heat in both the heart and spleen. The heart is represented by the tongue and governs the blood, while the meridians of the spleen emerge from under the tongue. When there is heat in both the heart and spleen, the blood and qi become abundant, accumulating at the root of the tongue, causing it to appear heavy, thickened, and short. If it affects the inner cheeks and upper palate, it is called a heavy palate; if it affects the gums, it is called heavy gums. In all cases, one should eliminate the blood by needling and apply true cattail pollen; alternative treatments include applying ash, horse’s tooth nitrate, borax, or alchemical nitrate; or using bamboo juice mixed with berberine for application, which is also effective.</p>
<p>Additionally, the condition referred to as a &quot;wooden tongue&quot; occurs when the tongue indicates the state of the heart and the meridians of the spleen are obstructed. With the internal organs stagnant, heat accumulates in the heart and spleen, leading the heat to surge upward and causing the tongue to swell, gradually enlarging and filling the mouth, resulting in a wooden tongue. If not treated urgently, it will surely cause harm.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Use two parts of stone nitrate, one part of purple frost, and half a part of white salt, grind them together, and mix them with half a cash of bamboo juice and well water for application. It is also acceptable not to use stone nitrate and salt. Another method involves finely grinding yellow hibiscus flowers, using half the amount of cinnabar, and grinding them together seven times for application. If the tongue swells and fills the mouth, applying just borneol is also effective. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if there is tongue movement, it indicates slight heat in the spleen, causing the tongue veins to tighten. One should relax the tongue regularly. When treating this, do not use cold medicines; instead, gradually administer yellow powder. If water consumption is suspected to be heat-related, do not use cold medicines, as this is misleading. Drinking water indicates spleen and stomach deficiency, with a lack of fluids. Additionally, if the complexion is pale and thin, accompanied by five hearts feeling hot, it indicates malnutrition and should be treated with substances like hu huanglian pills. </p>
<p>If the illness is severe and there is tongue movement after medication, it is a bad sign. For a white coating on the tongue accompanied by black spots, powder borax and mix it; if heat is severe, add borneol or simply use yellow lead the size of a bean to press under the tongue, which is particularly effective.<br>Teeth are slow to grow.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>Nie said: &quot;Those who inherit insufficient kidney qi will have weak marrow. Since the marrow is what nourishes the bones, if the marrow is insufficient, it cannot reach the teeth, which is why tooth development is delayed. One should take equal parts of Chuanxiong, Gan Di Huang, Shan Yao, Dang Gui, Shao Yao, and Gan Cao, grind them into a powder, and take with warm water. Alternatively, one can rub the gum with the powdered medicine, and the teeth will grow.&quot;</p>
<p>Throat Blockage and Swelling of the Cheeks</p>
<p>Chao said: &quot;These two conditions are due to wind and poison qi affecting the throat, which combines with blood qi to form a swelling that becomes toxic. If heat enters the heart, it will lead to agitation, lack of appetite, and potentially death. For this condition, one should urgently administer Jin Xing Wan. For children with throat and cheek swelling and pain, one should use Sheng Ma, Ma Ya Xie, Borax, and Niu Huang, and Lian Qiao Decoction is essential; Lian Qiao and Lu Decoction can also be taken.&quot;</p>
<p>Stagnation in the Jaw</p>
<p>Chao said: &quot;When children have stagnation in the jaw, saliva flows out and accumulates in the jaw area. This is due to a cold spleen leading to excessive saliva. The liquid of the spleen is saliva, and when the spleen and stomach are deficient and cold, they cannot control the secretion of fluids, causing the saliva to flow out and accumulate in the jaw. Zhang&#39;s Wen Pi Dan can treat this. Another method is to use a combination of various herbs for decoction and hold them in the mouth; this will also prevent saliva from flowing out. Yi Huang San can also treat this condition, and Wen Pi San can be taken as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Medical Principles by Yu Tuan</p>
<p>Heavy Tongue and Gums</p>
<p>For children with heavy tongues and gums, it is advisable to use a three-edged needle to draw blood and internally take Dong Yuan Liang Ge San. Overall, for any oral issues, acupuncture is the most efficient.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>Swollen Tongue</strong></p>
<p>For children with wind-stopping, if the tongue is swollen, there must be a “stopping worm” present, resembling a mole cricket, with fine hair on its head, which is small and white. Burning it with a heated iron can make it disappear; if not treated urgently, it can be fatal. It is said that a horse may cause throat paralysis, with the mouth full of white sores like snow, resulting from spleen deficiency. If influenced by wind evil, one should first dispel the evil and then take tonics to nourish the spleen qi and generate spleen blood. Dragon fire does not suit cooling substances; it is advisable to treat it with sweet and warm remedies.</p>
<p><strong>Stagnant Saliva</strong></p>
<p>For children with stagnant saliva, drooling occurs and seeps into the jaw area. The liquid of the spleen is saliva, which cannot be contained due to the cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach. The treatment is to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added patchouli. If the child is thirsty and drinks cold, it pertains to excess heat, hence, one should clear the stomach fire; if thirsty and drinking soup, it indicates deficiency heat, needing supplementation of the Middle and enhancement of qi. If there is excess heat in the spleen channel and the submandibular gland cannot regulate, use Niuhuang Qingxin Wan; if there is deficiency heat in the spleen channel, use Six Gentlemen with patchouli. For excess heat in the stomach channel causing worms to stir and fluids to flow out, use Xie Huang Powder; for heat, use Five Flavor Different Effect Powder. For constipation, use a cooling drink; for sinking middle qi, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; if there is food accumulation and internal heat, use Da An Wan. Additionally, refer to the sections on mouth sores and swelling for further guidance.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Throat Obstruction</p>
<p>In children, throat obstruction occurs due to accumulated heat from rich foods, or due to inherent heat, or from the negative emotions of the wet nurse, or from toxic food and drink. It is important to differentiate the nature of the obstruction and its severity, and to treat according to the respective meridian it pertains to. If the left cheek appears bluish-red, it is due to wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder meridians; treat with Chai Hu and Zhi Zi powder. If the right cheek is red, there is heat in the lung meridian; treat with Xie Bai powder. If the forehead is red, it indicates heat in the heart and small intestine meridians; use Dao Chi powder. If there is also a bluish tint, it suggests a combination of wind and heat, and treat with a modified Xiao Yao powder. If there is a yellow color between the nostrils, it indicates obstruction in the spleen and stomach meridians; treat with Xie Huang powder. If there is also a bluish color, it implies wood overcoming earth; use modified Xiao Yao powder. If red, it indicates the heart&#39;s influence over the earth; treat with Chai Hu and Zhi Zi powder. If there is redness on the chin, it suggests heat in the kidney meridian; use Di Huang pills. In cases where there is accumulated heat internally and difficulty with urination and defecation, the treatment should alleviate and open these pathways. If there is an external wind pathogen causing chills and fever, it should be expelled. If wind pathogen is present along with constipation and excessive thirst and phlegm, internal release and external resolution are needed. If the obstruction is due to heat accumulated from the wet nurse&#39;s rich diet, the mother should take Dong Yuan&#39;s Clear Stomach powder; if caused by her anger and liver fire, she should take modified Xiao Yao powder. If the child is constitutionally yin deficient, they should take Di Huang pills. Generally, mild and harmonious medications should be used to treat the underlying condition, avoiding harsh and damaging drugs that harm the vital energy.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Tongue Play and Tongue Projection</strong></p>
<p>The tongue is associated with the heart and spleen meridians. When a child’s tongue slightly shows and then retracts immediately, it is called tongue play, indicating deficiency of the heart and spleen, to be treated with warming spleen powders. When the tongue extends and remains out for a long time, it is called tongue projection, which signifies accumulation of heat in the heart and spleen, to be addressed with purging yellow powders. If accompanied by sores in the mouth and thirst for cold drinks, this belongs to excess heat in the stomach meridian, and the same powders are used. If there is thirst for warm beverages, it indicates deficiency heat in the stomach meridian, to be treated with Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is little food intake leading to thirst, or loose stools, it reflects weakness of the spleen and stomach, requiring Seven Flavor White Atractylodes Powder. If there is salivation at the corners of the mouth or swelling in the cheeks, it indicates wind-heat in a weak stomach; first, use Ginseng to Calm the Stomach Powder, then apply Seven Flavor White Atractylodes Powder. If the condition is severe in the afternoon, it suggests blood deficiency in the spleen; add more ginseng, atractylodes, and poria to the Four Substances Decoction. If it occurs due to malnutrition, reference should be made to the guidelines for malnourishment.</p>
<p><strong>Mouth Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Mouth ulcers arise from stagnation of spleen qi, exacerbated by wind-heat, leading to their appearance. Children who are overly warmed and nourished may also have sores due to heat in the heart. In cases of febrile diseases, sores appearing on the upper lip indicate internal evil heat affecting the organs; sores on the lower lip signify internal heat harming the anus. These mouth ulcers are indeed connected to the evil heat from the internal organs.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p>
<h3>Evidence and Treatment Criteria</h3>
<h4>Mouth</h4>
<p>When an infant is newly born, it is urgent to wrap it in soft cloth and wipe away the foul blood and impurities from its mouth and tongue, referred to as &quot;jade clasped.&quot; If the infant cries out, it will lead to various ailments.</p>
<h4>Tongue</h4>
<p>Next, examine under the tongue. If there is a membrane connecting the tongue like a pomegranate seed, and if the child does not cry or there is no change in voice, use your fingernail to cut it or use a reed knife to slice it. A slight amount of blood indicates vitality. If there is a significant amount of blood underneath the tongue, mix burnt fine ashes with a little pig fat and apply it.</p>
<h4>Teeth and Lips</h4>
<p>The &quot;Holy Benefit&quot; states: Observe the roots of the teeth; if there are two yellow veins, use a reed knife to sever them and apply pig&#39;s milk. If the child&#39;s eyes are hard to open, first apply pig&#39;s milk. The upper lip is connected to the gums by a vein. If the vein connecting the upper lip is tight, it causes conditions in the upper region; if the vein for the lower lip is tight, it leads to conditions in the lower region. Conditions in the upper part can result in sores that appear on the head or between the brows, resembling scabs. If itching persists and yellow fluid seeps out, sores will develop. Conditions arising from the lower part can affect the waist and back, eventually reaching the limbs, manifesting similarly as above. If severe cases are untreated, or if symptoms affect both head and face, it may lead to prolonged illness or even death. Daily morning mouth wiping is recommended.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Mouth and Tongue Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Mouth ulcers in children occur due to irregular breastfeeding, or from the mother consuming rich foods that generate heat, or from the emotions of the wet nurse causing fire. The symptoms appear on the lips, tongue, and gums resembling ulcers. If there is fever and thirst with a desire for cold drinks, a red complexion on the forehead, and a rapid left pulse, this indicates a heart issue. First, use Daohong San to clear heart fire, then use Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water. If there are alternating chills and fever, with a blue-red left cheek and a taut and rapid left pulse, this relates to the liver channel. First, use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San to clear liver fire, then use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish liver blood. If both cheeks are yellow-red, the gums are decaying, the stool has a sour smell, and the right pulse is rapid yet soft, it indicates a spleen issue. Use Si Wei Fei Er Wan to treat spleen fire, and Wu Wei Yi Gong San to tonify spleen qi. If there is fever and coughing, with a red right cheek and a rapid right pulse that feels thin on palpation, this indicates a lung issue. First, use Qing Fei Yin to treat lung fire, and Wu Wei Yi Gong San to nourish the spleen and stomach. If there is fever and thirst, both cheeks are dark, and the left pulse is rapid, it shows deficiency in the kidney channel. First, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to produce kidney water, then use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to generate lung qi. </p>
<p>There is also a condition called &quot;running horse dampness,&quot; which arises from damage to the spleen and stomach qi and blood after illness, leading to deficiency fire rising, or due to residual poison from measles attacking upward. The disease progresses rapidly and requires urgent use of Tonglu San and Da Wu Yi Tang. In mild cases, this leads to rotten gums and swollen lips and cheeks; in severe cases, the gums erode, and the cheeks and jaws become extensively decayed.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>If food and drink do not enter, and there is severe wheezing and phlegm, this indicates a deficiency in the spleen and stomach, leading to failure of lung qi; if there is a swollen cheek that is red and rotten without pain, this indicates a severe deficiency of stomach qi, resulting in dead tissue and should not be treated. </p>
<p>The classics state: the Hand Shaoyin channel connects to the tongue, while the Foot Taiyin channel connects to the mouth. When there is heat in the heart and spleen channels, sores can appear on the mouth and tongue. One should examine the facial features and assess the deficiency or excess of the meridians for treatment. </p>
<p>If the vital energy is not depleted and a sudden illness causes white spots in the mouth or a heavy tongue, one can use tangled hair to wrap around the fingers and dip it in well water to wipe it; or draw out toxic blood using needles and apply willow flower powder. If there is swelling in the palate or blisters, they should be punctured, with powder applied afterwards, or blue indigo can be used to rub on the area; if it recurs after needling, needle again.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If the lips are cracked, apply a mixture of angelica ointment with willow flower powder. If there is a deficiency of vital energy or if cold medicines have been taken, or if there is nausea and poor appetite, this indicates a deficiency heat; use Wuwei Yigong powder with added Shengma and Chaihu. If there is diarrhea and thirst, it suggests weakness of the spleen and stomach; use Qiwwei Baizhu powder. If there is abdominal pain and aversion to cold, this points to cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach; use Liu Jun pill with ginger and cinnamon. If the mother’s food and drink were improperly prepared, use Qingwei powder. If the mother was overworked due to food and labor, use Buzhong Yiqi decoction. For liver and spleen blood deficiency, use Jiawei Xiaoyao powder. For internal heat due to frustration or anger, use Jiawei Guipi decoction, for both mother and child to take together. If there is mud (excess heat), it will inevitably change to slow wind of the spleen. Continue to apply treatments that involve sticking out and manipulating the tongue. When using needles on the tongue, it is better to insert them straight with a thin needle rather than piercing sideways, as this could damage the tongue&#39;s vessels and lead to unclear speech.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>The Tongue</strong></p>
<p>The tongue is a messenger of the heart and a channel of the spleen. When the two meridians retain heat without being released, it manifests in the tongue. If the tongue&#39;s veins feel slightly tense and one relaxes the tongue frequently, it is called &quot;playing with the tongue.&quot; If there is a growth underneath the tongue close to the root that resembles a small tongue, it is referred to as &quot;heavy tongue.&quot; If the tongue swells and fills the mouth, it is known as &quot;wood tongue.&quot; </p>
<p>The Zeng family states that all conditions related to this are due to the spleen, heart, and liver having been subjected to extreme heat, which is what is referred to as &quot;heavy tongue&quot; and &quot;wood tongue.&quot; They are also called &quot;yellow tongue&quot; and &quot;duck&#39;s mouth.&quot; Although the names differ, they all signify heat. Generally, the heavy tongue appears beneath the tongue, protruding like a tongue, hence it is called &quot;heavy tongue.&quot; The spleen&#39;s channels are linked to the side of the tongue, the liver&#39;s channels connect to the base of the tongue, and the heart&#39;s channels are linked to the root of the tongue.</p>
<p>If these three meridians are affected by damp heat or wind-cold, the tongue may curl, retract, stretch, or swell. It would be appropriate to use &quot;Xiao Huang San&quot; and &quot;Lu Pao San&quot; as treatments, along with &quot;Dang Gui San&quot; and &quot;Qiang Huo San&quot; to administer.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Tongue Disturbances</strong></p>
<p>Tongue disturbances indicate a mild heat in the spleen. Tian says: If it is plump and solid, treat it with Niu Huang San.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Tongue</strong></p>
<p>Tian says: For the treatment of a heavy tongue, use bitter bamboo juice to soak yellow bile powder and apply it to the tongue. If it does not improve, later use true pu huang to dress it; it will heal in no more than three applications. Lightly fry true pu huang, spread it on paper, release the heat, grind it finely, and use some to apply to the tongue. Then take warm water, dip a fine cloth, wrap your finger, and gently press it down; after pressing, apply the medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Wooden Tongue</strong></p>
<p>Zeng says: A wooden tongue is swollen and hard, hindering milk and food intake, indicating excessive wind-heat. Remedies such as Dang Gui San, Xie Huang San, and Yu Lu Yin can be taken; then apply Xie Huang San to rub on the tongue. The tongue is the organ of the heart; if the heart is heated, it will cause ulcers and cracks; if the liver is congested, blood will surge out; if the spleen is obstructed, it will be like snow from the fetus; if hot, it will swell; if windy, it will be strong and wooden, making the mouth close and difficult to open, limbs will feel strong heat, and there will be wheezing and speech difficulties—these are the signs. The treatment method involves cooling and resolving the upper jiao and the evil heat in the heart, liver, and spleen meridians, dispersing wind and transforming phlegm. Initially use Bai Jie San combined with Wu He Tang, boiled with ginger and distilled lotus seed; then add Burdock Soup together with Dang Gui San, adding raw Rehmannia and brewing with ginger for consumption.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Throat</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Heart Mirror&quot; states: The throat is the crucial part of the body, connected with the stomach qi, and the place from which breathing emerges. If in the chest and diaphragm there accumulates heat and toxins, leading to the generation of wind-phlegm, which becomes stagnant and unresolved, it manifests as diseases of the throat—ulcers may form inside the throat, or appear as decayed flesh, resulting in swelling and pain, creating an obstruction that hinders swallowing, and in severe cases, a heavy tongue may develop. In treatment, it is essential to first eliminate wind-phlegm to clear the throat and diaphragm, and then resolve the heat and toxins; if treatment is delayed, serious consequences may ensue. Moreover, if heat toxins invade the soft palate causing ulcers, it is known as hanging sore or intestinal cold, which can also lead to throat closure and difficulty in swallowing. When faced with illness, treat it diligently!</p>
<p>The diseases of the throat mainly stem from the attack of heat toxins. Throughout the seasons, these can harm the heart and viscera, and daily exposures can attack the throat, this is referred to as kidney cold injury. Symptoms include single or double flesh worms, heavy tongue, wooden tongue, mumps, and hanging swellings; severe cases may cause swelling of the head and face from the upward attack. The general principle is first to cleanse the white coating on the tongue, then to dispel wind saliva. For single or double flesh worms, if they are suitable for needling, then needle them; if they are unsuitable, use fumigating powders to retreat them, afterwards apply internal medications. For wooden tongue, aside from taking medicines, continue using medicinal powders. In cases of mumps, apply topical medications; mild cases may resolve with just oral medications, without the need for needling or medicinal points, allowing the ulcers to heal on their own.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Throat Candidiasis</strong></p>
<p>Throat candidiasis is primarily caused by the excessive heat from the heart and spleen channels, which leads to the appearance of white patches resembling snowflakes throughout the mouth. In severe cases, there can be significant swelling in the throat, making breastfeeding difficult and resulting in frequent crying. Wrap a piece of blue gauze around the head and use fresh spring water to wipe away the white patches for purification. It is acceptable for the process to cause some bleeding; afterward, apply ice and borax powder, and administer cooling herbal medicine internally.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p>
<h3>Heavy Tongue</h3>
<p>A child&#39;s heavy tongue is caused by excessive heart fire. One should pierce the affected area with a fine needle to release the bad blood, and internally take a detoxifying Heart-Resolving Decoction. Externally, apply Ice Borax Powder. There are also conditions like purple tongue and wood tongue, which arise from heart fire. Apply a little flying salt mixed with a small amount of borneol to treat it, and it may heal by itself with saliva. If phlegm and qi are trapped on the tongue, forming painful and hard lumps, use a fine needle to pierce and let it bleed. Then apply Ice Borax Powder and take Huang Lian Heart-Resolving Decoction.</p>
<h3>Running Horse Sore</h3>
<p>The term &quot;Running Horse Sore&quot; indicates a rapid onset that cannot be delayed. It often arises from residual toxins of measles and smallpox, as well as from excessive heat of various diseases. The symptoms include rotten gums, black decay that emits a foul smell, and, in severe cases, loss of gums with roots turning black and decaying. Within a few days, this can lead to perforated cheeks and split lips, making it truly difficult to cure. At the onset, it is advisable to use Aloe Vera Decoction to dispel the sore, and externally apply Ren Zhong Bai Powder or Ice Borax Powder to remove black necrotic tissue, revealing red flesh and flowing blood, which is a good sign. If stubborn meat does not fall away, rotting continues to open, swelling spreads outward, and the foul odor persists along with persistent body heat, it is considered incurable.</p>
<h3>Five Incurable Tooth Sores</h3>
<ol>
<li>Bad breath and filthy saliva: Incurable.</li>
<li>Black necrotic tissue that does not come off: Incurable.</li>
<li>Teeth falling out without blood: Incurable.</li>
<li>Perforated cheeks and split lips: Incurable.</li>
<li>No effectiveness from medication: Incurable.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Lip Diseases</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Wind, toxin, dampness, and heat attach themselves where there is deficiency. When they interact with the blood and qi, they cause sores and ulcers. If they appear on the lips as sores that intermittently heal and then reappear, it is called &quot;tight lips&quot; or &quot;heavy lips.&quot; If they occur frequently, the lips become swollen and thick, sometimes even with lingering sores, leading to lip deformity. If they arise inside the lips, forming sores that connect to both cheeks, it is referred to as &quot;oral sores.&quot; If they occur at the corners of the mouth, they are called &quot;swallow&#39;s mouth.&quot; It is commonly said that this is due to dairy and food observing swallows, which causes swallow&#39;s mouth sores.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Tongue Manipulation</strong></p>
<p>When young children manipulate their tongues, there are two indications: one is heart heat. The heart is connected to the root of the tongue; when it is hot, the root becomes dry and tense, prompting the child to frequently stick out their tongue in a relaxed manner. The second is spleen heat. The spleen is connected to the tongue; when it is hot, the tongue also becomes dry and tense, leading to the same behavior. Both cases cause a desire for water. Heart heat results in thirst, while spleen heat causes depletion of fluids, which both provoke drinking. These two conditions are similar and should be examined carefully. A child with heart heat has a red face, experiences heat in the mouth while sleeping, is often restless, prefers coolness, and may grind their teeth. Treatment should focus on reducing heat. A child with spleen heat has hard, yellow stools, a yellowish face, and slight bodily jaundice; treatment should involve gentle guiding, avoiding cold medicines and excessive purging. If forcefully purged, it can lead to spleen and stomach deficiency, fluid depletion, and aggravate the child&#39;s restlessness and emaciation, ultimately resulting in malnutrition. If tongue manipulation occurs after a serious illness and medication, it is a very bad sign. Treatment with Ginseng Zhimu Powder and Xiahuang Powder is recommended.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>On Tongue Diseases</strong></p>
<p>When a child develops sores or swelling on the tongue, it results from the invasion of wind, toxins, and heat affecting the vital energy and blood. If the tongue presents with purple swelling, it is referred to as &quot;purple tongue swelling.&quot; If the swelling is large and firm, it is called &quot;hard tongue swelling.&quot; If sores appear due to the clash of wind and dampness, it is termed &quot;tongue sores.&quot; If there is an abundance of wind and the tongue swells like a blowfish, it is known as &quot;drum tongue.&quot; Severe cases of purple tongue, hard tongue, or drum tongue may lead to excessive salivation, blocking of the airway, and can be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>On Throat Diseases</strong></p>
<p>When a child suffers from throat diseases, it is caused by the interaction of wind, toxins, dampness, and heat affecting the vital energy and blood, targeting weak points along the meridians, leading to illness. If it occurs in the throat, it may manifest as throat obstruction, a type of throat wind, or &quot;goose milk.&quot; In serious cases, it could lead to horse throat paralysis, or may present as abscesses or swelling in the jaw and throat, or sores within the throat.</p>
<p><strong>On Obstructions in the Throat</strong><a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>A child may accidentally swallow objects that get stuck in the throat, causing inability to swallow or expel them, which hinders eating and drinking, leading to discomfort; in severe cases, it may cause pain and immediate deterioration, potentially resulting in danger.</p>

<p>The Wan family&#39;s &quot;Pediatric Exploration&quot; states: A child suffers from sores on the mouth and tongue. The doctor prescribed various medications containing Scutellaria, Coptis, and other similar drugs, to no effect. I said this is caused by heat in the heart. Bitter herbs enter the heart and further support its heat, hence they are ineffective. I then formulated a &quot;Heart-Cleansing Powder,&quot; and after one dose, the child was calm.</p>
<p>My nephew had sores all around his mouth, affecting the throat, lips, and tongue. I used one qian of Herba Coptidis and Radix Scutellariae, five fen of vermilion and white alum, and three fen of roasted pill millipede, ground them finely, and applied it as a poultice. It worked immediately; this is indeed a marvelous remedy.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Family Medical Records&quot; states: A small child played with his tongue and had convulsions; his fingers were not cold. I diagnosed this as a deficiency of liver and spleen with heat, treated with a modified Yigong Powder combined with Cimicifuga and Bupleurum, leading to recovery. Later, he suffered from abdominal distention after feeding on milk; when treated with a purgative, he exhibited convulsions again. After checking the wet nurse, who had excessive liver fire, I used Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Cimicifuga and Atractylodes, and both mother and child recovered.</p>
<p>Another small child, having consumed too much milk, experienced vomiting and diarrhea. I prescribed a large dose of Yigong Powder with added Bupleurum and Cimicifuga, and both mother and child recovered. Later, due to fright, he took several precious pills, which caused convulsions and tongue movements, nearly leading to chronic convulsions. I then administered Liu Junzi Decoction with added Aconitum and he recovered.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>A young child sticks out his tongue, has a fever, drinks cold water, his forehead and nose are yellow and red, he sticks out his tongue and drools. I believed it was due to excessive heat in the heart and spleen, and treated him with the &quot;Yao Chi&quot; and &quot;Xie Huang&quot; powders, resulting in recovery. Later, he had a relapse, and I prescribed other cooling medicines. Examining his tongue again, I used &quot;Yi Gong San&quot; with added &quot;Diao Teng Gou,&quot; and he was at ease; subsequently, I used &quot;Liu Jun Zi Tang&quot; to achieve complete recovery.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Zheng Zhi Zhun Sheng,&quot; it is stated: A young child has swelling and pain in the throat, experiences fright and anxiety, and drinking water and taking medications for convulsions and reducing heat worsens his condition. Other doctors insisted on attacking wind phlegm. I reasoned that the fright and anxiety indicated a deficiency in the heart. Indeed, the stomach is the root of the five organs. First, I used &quot;Wu Wei Yi Gong San&quot; to nourish the stomach, adding &quot;Jie Geng&quot; and &quot;Gan Cao&quot; to clear toxins, and all symptoms immediately subsided; then I prescribed &quot;Niu Bang Zi Tang&quot; with added &quot;Chai Hu,&quot; resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A young child experiences fever, drinks cold water, has yellow stools, and both hands and feet feel hot, making it impossible for him to suckle. Upon inspection, there were no issues in the mouth, but he cried when examining his throat. The pain in his throat was due to excessive heat in the spleen and stomach. I used &quot;Xie Huang&quot; and &quot;Qing Wei&quot; powders, with both mother and child taking a dose, resulting in recovery. Later, due to the wet nurse consuming alcohol, the child became restless and drooled. I again used the previous two powders, leading to recovery.</p>

Later, due to food stagnation, taking harsh medicine resulted in persistent throat swelling and abdominal distension and pain, indicating further damage to the spleen qi. I prescribed Yigong Powder, adding Shengma and Danggui, and the child was cured.</p>
<p>Another child suffered from the previous symptoms after the mother became angry, along with teeth grinding and yawning. I believed this was a sign of deficiency heat in the liver channel. The child was treated with a sweet tangerine decoction plus Chaihu, Zhizi, and Niubangzi, while the mother took a modified Xiao Yao Powder and recovered.</p>
<p>A child with a fondness for rich foods developed throat swelling and pain, with copious phlegm accumulation.

Later, after being startled and taking Zhibao Pill, the child expelled phlegm, convulsed, and had cold hands and feet, indicating liver wood deficiency with lung metal excess. I used a Buzhong Yiqi Decoction to tonify the spleen and lungs, and Liuwei Dihuang Pill to nourish the liver and kidneys, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A child with redness on the forehead, hot soles, and persistent throat pain was prescribed medicine to clear the stomach and expel toxins. I suspected insufficient kidney water and excessive heart fire, suggesting the use of Dihuang Pills to strengthen the water to counteract the scorching fire. Unfortunately, the child had a fiercely red mouth and tongue, with urination resembling dripping, and ultimately did not survive.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>A young child had swelling and pain in the throat, drooling from the corners of the mouth, and warmth in the hands and feet.

<p>Children&#39;s diseases of the chest and back.</p>
<p>Children&#39;s Due Treatise [by Qian Yi of the Song Dynasty]</p>
<p>“Curved Chest and Curved Back”</p>
<p>Curved chest and curved back occur when a child is afflicted by wind that invades the spine and enters the marrow, resulting in a curved back. If there is lung heat and fullness attacking the chest and diaphragm, it leads to a curved chest. Use turtle urine to apply to the joints for self-healing. The method of obtaining the urine involves placing a tortoise on blue lotus leaves and using a mirror to reflect it, causing the urine to flow out.</p>
<p>[Note: A child&#39;s vital energy is not fully developed, and their skin pores are not tightly sealed, allowing wind evil to penetrate. Alternatively, phlegm and heat can accumulate in the lungs, hence the attack of wind and heat leading to these symptoms; or the child may have been exposed to wind too early, resulting in the invasion into the marrow. Treatment should primarily focus on nourishing the spleen and lungs. If the condition arises due to the mother’s consumption of rich and spicy foods, her treatment should also be addressed. If it is due to constitutional deficiency of the father&#39;s liver and kidney heat, Liu Wei Di Huang Wan should be used. If it is due to a deficiency of kidney qi, Ba Wei Di Huang Wan should be used.] </p>
<p>Delayed action.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>When a child fails to grow, or if they are able to walk but their legs are weak, it indicates a deficiency of the胎 (prenatal essence). </p>
<p>Children who walk late may have deficient liver and kidney, and those who are unable to walk as they grow may also have this condition; some may exhibit weakness in their liver qi and experience cramps in their hands and feet. If the liver and kidneys are both weak, they cannot extend their legs. The remedy is to use the Rehmannia Six Formula for nourishment.</p>
<p>The condition of &quot;turtle chest&quot; refers to a swollen, elevated chest that resembles a turtle, indicating lung heat. This can be treated with a modified Gengzhi Pill. In the case of children with turtle chest due to lung heat, administering this modified formula can bring about miraculous results. </p>
<p>The condition of &quot;turtle back&quot; presents as a hunched posture resembling a turtle shell, which is caused by external wind affecting the spine and entering the marrow. This often leads to a chronic ailment. Moxibustion should be applied to the two points next to the third vertebra and the two points next to the second vertebra, one and a half cun away from the spine. While this method works, it may not always yield results. The Zhiqiao Pill should be used. Turtle back is a severe condition marked by kidney wind entering the marrow. Internal consumption of the Zhiqiao Pill and moxibustion should be done consecutively.</p>
<p>What is meant by walking late? Bones are nourished by marrow, and if blood and qi do not sufficiently fill the marrow, the bones become weak and soft, leading to an inability to walk. This arises from both kidney and liver deficiency. Since the liver governs the tendons, weakness in the tendons prevents early walking; the kidney governs the bones, and weak bones cannot be strong. The remedy is to use the modified Rehmannia Six Formula. </p>
<p>When both the liver and kidney are deficient, leading to inadequate walking capability, since the liver governs tendons and the kidney governs bones, replenishing the qi and blood of both meridians can be achieved by using the modified Rehmannia formula for assistance.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br><strong>Crane Knee</strong></p>
<p>Those with thin legs inherit insufficiency; their qi and blood are not sufficient, resulting in thin muscles and exposed joints, resembling the knees of a crane. This is also due to kidney deficiency, named crane knee joint. Modified Rehmannia Pills are the remedy for this. For children with crane knee, this is associated with kidney deficiency. Modified Rehmannia should be administered. There are no worries with taking it.</p>
<p><strong>Turtle Back, Turtle Chest, Crane Knee, and Delayed Walking</strong></p>
<p>In the &quot;Sacred Benefits,&quot; it is noted that children with turtle chest suffer from lung heat and fullness of qi; if the wet nurse consumes too much spicy food, this condition may also arise; or if the wet nurse has residual milk, the infant may develop the same condition. Usually, removing the residual milk will resolve this issue. The Sacred Benefits Turtle Chest Pills should be used for treatment. The &quot;Sacred Benefits&quot; also states that turtle back refers to infants who are not yet half a week old and are forced to sit early, allowing exterior wind to affect their spine, resulting in a high back resembling a turtle. There is a moxibustion method to treat this condition. </p>
<p>There is also a crane knee condition, for which the Qian family’s Rehmannia Pills should be modified by adding deer antler to replenish kidney qi. There is also a condition of delayed walking; Rehmannia Pills should be augmented with achyranthes root, five-flavor root, and roasted deer antler, and there is a formula for Five-Flavor Root Powder for treatment. </p>
<p>For turtle head, there are Turtle Chest Pills to dispel heat. Pine Flower Pills and Lily Pills are particularly effective for turtle chest and turtle back. Antelope Horn Pills treat those aged five to six who cannot walk.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br><strong>Babies&#39; Essentials</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty, Xue Kai</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Turtle Chest and Turtle Back</strong>  </p>
<p>The condition known as &quot;Turtle Chest and Turtle Back&quot; primarily requires the adjustment and supplementation of the spleen and lungs, with an addition of clearing heat and resolving phlegm. If it is due to the nursing mother consuming rich and thick foods, the mother should take a stomach-clearing powder, and the child should also take a small amount.  </p>
<p><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong>  </p>
<p>&quot;Crane Knee Wind&quot; refers to legs that are thin, with knees that are thicker, resembling a crane&#39;s knee, hence the name. This condition arises from insufficient kidney energy, allowing external pathogens to invade. Initially, there is pain inside the knee, with no change in external color, and difficulty in bending or stretching. If within one or two months it swells, turns red, and produces pus, it can be treated; if it is hard, white, and does not produce pus, it is difficult to treat. For early cases, use &quot;Major Fangfeng Decoction&quot; as the main remedy, supplementary with &quot;Qi-boosting and Nourishing Decoction&quot;; for advanced cases, use &quot;Middle Qi Tonifying Decoction&quot; with &quot;Major Fangfeng Decoction&quot; as a supplement, and be cautious not to use drugs that promote qi dispersal. If not resolved or if symptoms like fever appear, the spleen and stomach should be adjusted and supplemented well; otherwise, it will definitely worsen.  </p>
<p><strong>Medical Essentials</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty, Lou Ying</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Delayed Walking</strong>  </p>
<p>If a child who is three years old cannot walk, it is due to insufficient vital energy leading to weakness in physical strength. The waist, spine, legs, and knees have soft tendons and bones, preventing walking. Use &quot;True Five Flavor Bark&quot; ground into powder, mixed with porridge, and add a small amount of good wine; administer one walnut-sized portion three times a day for effectiveness.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br><strong>Respecting Life Focus</strong></p>
<p><strong>Turtle Chest</strong></p>
<p>The condition known as Turtle Chest is due to heat in the lungs causing fullness, which results in phlegm. It is advised to avoid breaking up the qi and dispersing it, as this may weaken the lungs; instead, one should avoid retention and seek to descend qi and eliminate phlegm.</p>
<p><strong>Standard for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang]</p>
<p><strong>Turtle Chest</strong></p>
<p>According to Zhang, if a wet nurse feeds an infant, it is common to squeeze out any stagnant milk; in summer, it is important to wash the milk clean and squeeze out the hot milk. Allowing the infant to drink hot milk can damage lung qi, leading to a swelling and fullness in the chest, which can make the chest rise high like a turtle, hence the name Turtle Chest. According to Zeng, this condition arises from wind and phlegm accumulating in the heart and chest, and subsequently, from exposure to wind and heat. The lungs, being the canopy of all organs, reside above the diaphragm. If water and qi overflow, the lungs become distended and, over time, solidify into phlegm, stagnating in the heart and chest. When compounded by internal wind and heat, external symptoms manifest as red lips and a flushed face, accompanied by cough and shortness of breath, causing the sternum to rise as if covered by a palm, termed Turtle Chest. The method of treatment is to relax the lungs, transform phlegm, and benefit the diaphragm to eliminate phlegm from the lung meridian. Initially, one should use the Wuling Powder mixed with a soothing qi decoction, combined with ginger juice and scallion broth for administration; next, utilize Qingfei Decoction, Xionghuang Powder, Biyu Pills, and Ruyi Ointment for treatment. If the initial medicine cures the condition but it recurs, if the transformation directs phlegm and saliva upwards, combined with seizures, it becomes difficult to treat.</p>
<p><strong>Turtle Back</strong></p>
<p>If the child sits up too early and windy conditions affect the spine, the wind can reach the marrow, causing the back to elevate like a turtle. Although there are many prescriptions, they often become chronic ailments, and moxibustion is crucial. It should be treated within the first hundred days.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br><strong>Delayed Walking</strong></p>
<p>Zhang said: Generally, a child must reach three hundred sixty days old, with knee bones formed, before they can walk. In recent times, many children are unable to walk due to their parents&#39; insufficient vitality and blood, which weakens the fetal energy, resulting in weak bones and muscles, making it impossible to take steps. The use of deer antler has proven effective. Tang stated that for children who cannot walk, the treatment should utilize Qian&#39;s Kidney Tonic with Rehmannia pills, adding deer antler, bark of Wu Jia, and musk. My nephew Huang Zhiluo&#39;s son could not walk at three years old; after taking this recipe, it yielded results.</p>
<p><strong>Medicine for Beginners</strong> (Ming Era, Li Zhan)</p>
<p><strong>Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>Weak hands cannot move effectively. This results from weak liver, causing the tendons in both hands to retract without being able to extend. The treatment is Yi Yi Wan. Weak and slow-moving feet signify insufficient bone marrow, inadequate qi and blood, and weak tendons that cannot support the bones. The remedy should be Kidney Qi Pills combined with Niu Xi, Wu Jia Pei, and deer antler. For those who cannot walk at five or six years old, sheep horn pills are recommended; for those unable to walk by three years old, use one tael of Wu Jia Pei, five qian each of Niu Xi and Mu Guo, ground into powder, and taken with a small amount of rice drink mixed with a bit of alcohol. For toes that curl and lack strength to extend, the remedy is Hai Tong San. Cases of &quot;crane joints wind,&quot; commonly known as &quot;drumstick wind,&quot; arise from kidney deficiency and depletion of essence, being attacked by wind evil. This leads to the skin not being nourished, gradually becoming withered, like a crane&#39;s joint. The suitable treatment is Kidney Qi Pills combined with Wu Jia Pei, deer antler, and Niu Xi.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br><strong>Young Guides</strong></p>
<p><strong>Turtle Chest</strong></p>
<p>When the lung meridian is heated, the chest swells high and is full, resembling a turtle&#39;s chest. For mild cases, administer Xie Bai San with Shan Zhi and Tian Men Dong; for severe cases, use Bai He Dan. Strictly avoid foods that are pungent, alcoholic, roasted, or stir-fried.</p>
<p><strong>Turtle Back</strong></p>
<p>When wind and cold invade the spinal cord, the back becomes tall like a turtle. This should be treated with Er Huo San. Apply moxibustion to the lung shu point, located on the sides below the third thoracic vertebra; and to the diaphragm shu point, below the seventh thoracic vertebra, with three to five moxibustion applications each. There are also cases of early sitting leading to stooped posture, which can be treated with Liu Wei Wan combined with Yi Ren, Mu Gua, Dang Gui, and Rou Gui.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Walking</strong></p>
<p>Delayed walking is associated with deficiencies in both the liver and kidneys. The kidneys govern the bones; if they are deficient, the marrow does not fill the bones, leading to weakness and difficulty in walking. The liver governs the tendons; if it is deficient, the blood does not nourish the tendons, causing weakness and inability to support the bones. This condition should be treated with Hu Jing Wan.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br><strong>Fang</strong></p>
<p><strong>Di Huang Wan</strong><br>[From &quot;Xiao Er Zhi Jue,&quot; same below]<br>Treats kidney deficiency and symptoms like delayed movement or speech. </p>
<p>Ingredients:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shu Di Huang (Processed Rehmannia Root)</strong> - 8 qian, washed with wine; nourishes kidney water, enriches true yin, replenishes blood and generates essence.  </li>
<li><strong>Shan Zhu Yu (Cornelian Cherry Fruit)</strong> - supplements the kidneys and enhances essence.  </li>
<li><strong>Gan Shen Yao (Dried Chinese Yam)</strong> - 4 qian each; cool and nourishing.  </li>
<li><strong>Mu Dan Pi (Tree Peony Bark)</strong> - cools the kidneys and drains the fire from within the yin; treats bone steaming due to lack of sweat in the Shaoyin.  </li>
<li><strong>Ze Xie (Alisma)</strong> - nourishes yin and enters the kidney channel.  </li>
<li><strong>Bai Fu Ling (Poria)</strong> - 3 qian each, enters the Ren and Gui.</li>
</ul>
<p>The prepared Shu Di Huang is ground into a paste, and the others are powdered, mixed with refined honey to form pills the size of tung seeds, taking 20 to 30 pills at a time with warm water on an empty stomach. Xue Ji said: This formula primarily treats the kidney channel, addressing symptoms of deficiency heat, such as thirst, painful urination, phlegm and gas obstruction; blood deficiency in the liver channel causing dryness and heat, leading to wind-heat afflictions like scrofula and tuberculosis; spasms in the limbs, eyelid twitching; lung channel deficiency heat causing cough, blood expectoration, dizziness; dry and painful throat, sores on tongue and lips; heart blood deficiency with heat causing night sweats and blood in the stool; spleen deficiency causing damp heat affecting the kidneys, leading to weakness in the lower back and knees; or symptoms of skin diseases like scabies and sores. This formula serves as a primary remedy, supplemented with medicinal agents for other organs. Overall, this remedy is based on the essence of celestial water. If one is constitutionally weak, with emaciated limbs, loss of speech, or experiences fear of light with prolapsus, five delays and five weaknesses, kidney and liver deficiencies, or premature sexual engagement leading to depletion of essence and energy in all five organs, all symptoms of deficiency should use this to nourish and revitalize.

<p>Acupuncture and Moxibustion</p>
<p>Tian said: For a child with a turtle chest, take one and a half inches from each breast, above the two rows and between three bones, applying three moxibustion at each of the six points, the size of a wheat grain. In spring and summer, apply moxibustion from the bottom up, and in autumn and winter, from the top down. Zhuang said: For a turtle chest, take one斗 of ash from nine families, place it in a winnowing basket, and have the child press their face to leave a mark on the chest. Apply moxibustion to the chest mark—above, the center, and on both sides—with three people each igniting the ash. Dispose of the ash in a river or water. The &quot;Holy Benefits&quot; mentions: For a child with a turtle back, apply moxibustion one and a half inches on each side beneath the third vertebra for the lung point, beneath the fifth vertebra for the heart point, and beneath the seventh vertebra for the diaphragm point. The child&#39;s middle fingertip is considered one inch. Each moxibustion should be the size of a small wheat grain, and perform three to five applications before halting. This method used repeatedly shows effectiveness in about one out of ten or twelve cases, but full efficacy is not guaranteed. The &quot;Precious Mirror&quot; states: For a child several years old who does not walk, apply moxibustion three times on each ankle.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>Medical Case</p>

<p>In the &quot;Young Pediatrics Expanded&quot; by the Wan family, it is recorded: A female scholar from Huangzhou was startled, and her right thumb was bent and could not straighten. The doctor used whole scorpions and silkworms to treat it, but to no effect. She asked me for a treatment method. The liver governs the tendons, and the tendons depend on blood for nourishment, thus it is said that the palm obtains blood and is capable of bending. When the blood is dry, the tendons wither and cannot straighten. The thumb is governed by the Tai Yin channel; metal is inherently dry, and treating it with wind-inducing medicine only exacerbates the dryness. Liu Zonghou said: Avoid treating wind and dryness; one must treat the fire when the wind and dryness are present. Thus, I prescribed a formula: ginseng solidifying base pills with added huangqin, huangbo, and zhimu, to be taken in pill form.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>The &quot;Heart Method of Surgery&quot; states: A three-year-old child suffers from pain in the arm due to toxic heat. After taking detoxification pills and applying Shen Gong powder, the condition improves. In cases of constipation or restlessness, taking the Five Blessings Detoxification Pill is also effective. If pus forms, it should be urgently lanced and treated with paper twisted and dipped in sesame oil, then covered with a medicated plaster. If the child is calm, there’s no need for medication; wait for the pus to drain and continue with the dressing. For children whose sores do not heal or recur, it is often due to the mother consuming roasted spicy foods or having heat disorders. It is advisable to first treat the mother&#39;s heat by adding Lülu decoction to her medicine, which will also help heal the child&#39;s sores. If the child is unable to take the medicine directly, add Lülu to the medicine for the mother, and the child&#39;s sores will also heal.</p>
<p>One child suffered from smallpox and discomfort in the arm, which would recur upon pressure. This was due to painful swelling, thus it was lanced, and the internal medicine was administered, leading to recovery. After smallpox, if there is swelling in the limbs and joints without redness, a decoction of honeysuckle and fine yellow soybean flour mixed with hot water can be applied, which will moisten and promote resolution. If after six or seven days there is no resolution and pus has formed, it should be lanced immediately, and the internal medicine should be taken.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials for Infant Care&quot; states: I foolishly treated a child who was thin, with slender legs and unable to walk, whose teeth were not sturdy and whose hair was sparse and short, indicating deficiency in the three Yin pathways. Using Liu Wei Di Huang Wan and Bu Zhong Yi Qi, all symptoms improved within a year, and the child&#39;s physique became robust.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br>A three-year-old child is unable to walk, has sparse teeth and hair, a thin body, fever and thirst, dark eyes with few pupils, and does not respond to the fat baby pills. This indicates a deficiency in the kidneys leading to malnutrition. The previous pills are meant for the spleen and stomach, but long-term use will increase the kidney deficiency and worsen the malnutrition. If one does not believe, the teeth and hair will gradually fall out. Using the Six-Flavor Pill combined with deer antler and schisandra will lead to recovery in half a year.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child has a left leg that is thin and short by an inch, has difficulty walking, and has more white than black in the eyes, possibly experiencing night sweats and yellow, grain-like hair.

<p>According to the &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Cases,&quot; a fifteen-year-old child has weak and soft hands and feet, cannot bite hard items, experiences internal heat and afternoon fevers, and has difficulty with urination resembling a dribble. Taking diuretic medications causes the urination to dribble; taking yin-replenishing medicines exacerbates the internal heat; taking damp-drying medicines results in heavy and sluggish bowel movements. I believe this stems from an insufficient kidney essence, early exposure to lust. Hence, the &quot;Essence and Blood&quot; chapter states: For a man, if his essence is not full and he engages with women to release it, there will be deficiency in the five organs, leading to difficulties later on. An elderly man with diminished yin who craves lust to release his essence will be unable to expel it, leading to internal decay, painful and dribbling urination. If the yin is consumed and then further depleted, it will cause pain in both urination and defecation; the more pain, the more frequent the urination, and the more frequent the urination, the more pain. This situation aptly describes the condition.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br>In the morning, I used the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and in the evening, I took the Six-Flavor Pill added with Schisandra fruit, each for over thirty doses, and the symptoms gradually improved. Later, I dreamt of emissions and the symptoms returned; my hands and feet were occasionally cold, and with phlegm and urgency rising, I used the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction added with Ba Wei Wan, each for eight doses. My bowel movements improved slightly, and my hands and feet warmed a bit; I continued the two previous medicines for over three months, and my vital energy gradually recovered, with normal eating and drinking. </p>
<p>Then, there was digestive stagnation with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but there was no tenderness upon palpation; this indicated injury to the spleen and stomach. I used the Liu Jun Zi Decoction added with Mu Xiang and Rou Dou Kou to treat it. Although the vomiting had not ceased, the left and right radial pulses were assessed lightly and were full. When palpated, they felt empty. The classics say: the kidneys open to the two yin. I used the Schisandra fruit powder for four doses, and the bowel movements suddenly ceased; afterwards, there was further food injury leading to sour regurgitation and diarrhea with heavy bowel movements. In the morning, I took the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and in the evening, the Liu Jun Zi Decoction with Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang, and I was cured.</p>
<p>An elderly man had a son whose limbs were weak and sensitive to wind and cold and felt pleasure in sunlight. I asked the wet nurse to take the modified Ba Wei Wan three times daily and one dose of the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, also giving it to the child. Over the course of a year, the limbs gradually became stronger, and by the age of two, he could walk.</p>
<p>A five-year-old boy had weak legs and was unable to walk, and he lost his innocence early on. By the age of seventeen, after marriage, he still had weak legs, and he felt his head was growing larger. Pleased with his caution, he resided in a Daoist temple. Consequently, in the morning, I prescribed him the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and in the evening, the Di Huang Wan with added Schisandra fruit and deer antler, and after a year, he became healthy.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br>A nine-year-old boy suffered from leg pain. Using the scallion poultice and the major wind-cold decoction, the swelling turned red. He was given the immortal life-prolonging drink and the tonifying middle and benefiting qi decoction alternately, and the swelling gradually reduced. He was also given the angelica and sclerotia decoction, combined with the tonifying middle and benefiting qi decoction; after two to three days and one poultice with scallion, it disappeared after over two months.</p>
<p>Another child had a serious ulcer that wouldn&#39;t heal. He was weak, ate little, felt dry and hot, especially in the afternoon. This was a severe deficiency of spleen qi. Five doses of the tonifying middle and benefiting qi decoction were given to replenish the original qi, followed by one dose of the major wind-cold decoction to treat the ulcer. After a month, all symptoms subsided. He was then given the complete tonifying decoction for a month, accompanied by the major wind-cold decoction to help resolve it.</p>
<p>A third child had a non-healing ulcer, with intermittent chills and fever, and dark, painful urination, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi. The complete tonifying decoction was given, adding ophiopogon and five-flavor herbs, leading to a quick recovery. He was advised to stop the cinnamon and continue with blood-tonifying pain-relief pills until healed.</p>
<p>A girl had pain in her left leg and took remedies for qi flow. Her left knee was swollen and hard, and she was coughing up phlegm. I diagnosed it as &quot;crane knee wind.&quot; Her pulse was wiry and rapid yet weak, indicating issues in the liver, spleen, and kidney meridians. As both the substantial body and the harmful qi were deficient, the primary focus should be on tonifying the spleen and stomach. Not believing this, she continued to attack the pathogenic qi, causing a flare-up of symptoms. I first used a modified five-flavor decoction with added schizonepeta, dried ginger, and cinnamon to strengthen her spleen qi, followed by different techniques, including the eight-treasure decoction, which led to discharge; then an alternating regimen of the major wind-cold decoction and earth yellow pill helped her recover.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>A young child experiences swelling in both knees. After applying various disinfectant medications, the feet and ankles become red and swollen. This is due to the child&#39;s inherited deficiency in kidney qi; therefore, using a formula like the Eight Treasures Decoction with Rehmannia will help reduce the swelling. If techniques to dispel pathogenic qi or other such medications are used, it will certainly lead to a failure in recovery.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Essential Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment,&quot; if a child has a foot injury causing pain without change in flesh color, the injury involves the bone. Frequent application of fried scallions compresses the area, and during the early morning hours, they can take a blood-regulating pain relief pill. During the day, herbal formulas to strengthen the spleen and invigorate qi and blood should be administered. After several months, taking Rehmannia pills for over three months leads to recovery.</p>
<p>In another case, a child dislocates the arm bone, resulting in swelling, pain, and fever. Using medications to dispel pathogenic qi is quite effective, but appetite decreases. I applied scallions to relieve the pain, which stopped immediately. Using the Six Gentlemen Decoction, astragalus, bupleurum, platycodon, dicentra, and fracture herbs helped improve appetite and reduce swelling. Furthermore, using the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi formula with Schisandra and the Five Flavors allowed the qi and blood to harmonize, leading to the resolution of heat and recovery.</p>
<p>A child experiences a sprain, with swelling around the ankle and weakness in form and energy. I intend to focus on treating them primarily by tonifying qi and blood while assisting with herbal formulas for dispersion. However, they opted for oral intake of dispersing medications and external application of cold herbs, as if they were suffering from alternating fever and chill. I noted that the symptoms of severe chills and fever, along with a strong pulse, indicated extreme qi and blood deficiency; thus, treatment yielded no results. Eventually, internal decay drained all qi and blood, leading to the child&#39;s demise.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　千金方 【唐　孙思邈】</p>
<p>　　　　　鹅口</p>
<p>　　凡小儿初出腹有鹅口者，其舌上有白屑如米；剧者，鼻中亦有之。此由儿在胞胎中受谷气盛故也，或妊娠时嗜糯米使之然。治之之法，以发缠着头，沾井花水撩拭之，三日如此，便脱去；如不脱，可煮栗荴汁令浓，以绵缠着头拭之。若春夏无栗荴，可煮栗木皮，如用井花水法。<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>　　　　　重舌</p>
<p>　　小儿初出腹有连舌，舌下有膜如石榴子中隔，连其舌下后，令儿言语不发不转也。可以爪摘断之，微有血出无害；若血出不止，可烧发作灰末敷之，血便止也。<br>　　　　　重腭重龂</p>
<p>　　小儿出腹六七日后，其血气收敛成肉，则口舌喉颊里清净也。若喉里舌上有物，如芦箨盛水状者，若悬痈有胀起者，可以绵缠长针，留刃处如粟米许大，以针刺决之，令气泄，去青黄赤血汁也。一刺之止，消息一日，未消者来日又刺之，不过三刺自消尽。余小小未消，三刺亦止，自然得消也。有着舌下如此者名重舌，有着颊里及上腭如此者名重腭，有着齿龂上者名重龂，皆刺去血汁也。刺后用盐洗拭，急用如圣散，或一字散掺刷。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>　　　　　齿病论</p>

<p>　　　　　鹅口口疮</p>
<p>　　巢氏曰：鹅口候者，小儿初生，口里白屑，满口上古，如鹅之口，故曰鹅口也。此乃胎热而心脾最盛，熏发于口也。葛氏用发缠指头，蘸井花水揩拭之；睡时以黄丹煅出火气，掺于舌上。小儿初出腹有连舌，舌下有膜，如石榴子中隔，连其舌下，后令儿言语不发不转也。可以爪甲摘断之，微有血出无害；若血出不止，可烧发作灰末傅之，血便止也。用保命散，枯白矾一钱，马牙硝半钱，朱砂一分，同研细，取白鹅粪以水搅取汁，调涂舌上颔颊内。先用发缠指揩拭舌上垢了，然后用药敷之。口疮候乃小儿血气盛，兼将养过温，心脏积热，熏蒸于上焦，故成口疮也。宜用南星末，淡酢调贴两脚心；乳母宜服洗心散，却用泻心汤。敷口之法，用黄连末以蜜水调抹口中。黄蘗、青黛、冰片皆可。又以牛黄少许末之，竹沥调涂口内，治鹅口。以马牙硝如豆许涂亦好。或口如鱼口不能合，或作鸦声者，难治。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>　　　　　重舌木舌弄舌</p>
<p>　　巢氏曰：小儿重舌者，心脾俱有热也。心候于舌而主血，脾之络脉出于舌下。若心脾有热，则血气俱盛，附于舌根，重生壅出如舌而短小是也。有着颊里及上腭者，名曰重腭；着齿龈者，曰重龈。皆当刺去其血，用真蒲黄敷之；或发灰、或马牙硝、或硼砂、或焰硝敷之；或竹沥浸黄蘗点之，亦好。　　又木舌证，舌者心之候，脾之脉络于舌也。脏腑壅滞，心脾积热，热气上冲，故令舌肿，渐渐胀大，塞满口中，是为木舌。若不急疗，必致害人。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>用(石卜)硝二分，紫霜一分，白盐半分，同研，每半钱竹沥井花水调敷。不用(石卜)硝及盐亦可。又方，用黄葵花研细，竟丹半之，同研点七次。又舌胀满口，单用冰片点之亦妙。　　又弄舌者，脾脏微热，令舌络微紧，时时舒舌。治之勿用冷药下之，当少与泻黄散渐服之。亦或饮水，医疑为热，必以冷药下之，非也。饮水者，脾胃虚，津液少也。又加面黄肌瘦，五心烦热，即为疳瘦，宜胡黄连丸辈。大病未愈，用药后弄舌者，凶。又有舌上白胎并黑色者，用硼砂为末掺之；热甚者加冰片，或单用黄丹如豆许，以按舌下尤妙。<br>　　　　　齿迟<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p>
<p>　　聂氏云：禀受肾气不足者，即髓不强。盖骨之所络而为髓，髓不足故不能充于齿，所以齿生迟也。宜用芎藭、干地黄、山药、当归、芍药、甘草各等分研末，用熟水调服，或时以药末擦牙龈，齿即生也。<br>　　　　　喉痹腮肿</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：此二证乃风毒之气客于咽喉，与血气相搏而结肿成毒，热入于心，即烦乱不食而死。此候急用金星丸下之。治小儿咽喉腮肿疼痛，当用升麻、马牙硝、硼砂、牛黄等剂，连翘汤不可缺也，连翘漏芦汤亦可服。<br>　　　　　滞颐</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：小儿滞颐者，涎流出而渍于颐间也。此由脾冷涎多故也。脾之液为涎，脾胃虚冷，不能收制其津液，故流出渍于颐也。张氏温脾丹主之。一法百药煎含咽，其涎自不出，亦截法也。益黄散亦治此证，温脾散亦可服。<br>　　　　医学正传 【明　虞抟】</p>
<p>　　　　　重舌重龈</p>
<p>　　儿有重舌、重龈者，宜用三棱针刺去血，内服东垣凉膈散。凡口内诸病，惟针最捷。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　　　身经通考方 【明　吴昆】</p>
<p>　　　　　舌肿</p>
<p>　　小儿噤风，凡舌肿下必有噤虫，状如蝼蛄，有头毛，其头小白，可烧铁烙头上即消；不急治能杀人。世传走马喉痹，满口白疮如雪，脾虚所致。若带风邪，当先泻其邪，进补脾气生脾血之剂。盖龙火不宜凉物，宜以甘温从治也。<br>　　　　保婴撮要 【明　薛铠】</p>
<p>　　　　　滞颐</p>
<p>　　小儿滞颐者，涎流出而渍于颐间也。脾之液为涎，由脾胃虚寒不能收摄耳。治用六君子汤加木香。凡作渴饮冷者，属实热，宜泻胃火；作渴饮汤者，属虚热，宜补中益气。若脾经实热，而廉泉不能约制者，用牛黄清心丸；脾经虚热而廉泉不能统摄者，用六君子加木香。胃经实热而虫动，津液流出者，用泻黄散；处热，用五味异功散。大便秘结，用清凉饮；中气下陷，用补中益气汤；食积内热，用大安丸。仍参口疮腮肿条互览之。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>　　　　　喉痹</p>
<p>　　小儿喉痹，因膏梁积热，或禀赋有热，或乳母七情之火，饮食之毒，当分其邪蓄表里，与证之轻重，经之所主而治之。若左腮色青赤者，肝胆经风热也，用柴胡栀子散。右腮色赤者，肺经有热也，用泻白散。额间色赤者，心与小肠经热也，用导赤散；若兼青色，风热相搏也，用加味逍遥散。鼻间色黄，脾胃经有执也，用泻黄散；若兼青色，木乘土位也，用加味逍遥散；兼赤色，心传土位也，用柴胡栀子散。颏间色赤，肾经有热也，用地黄丸。凡此积热内蕴，二便不通者，当疏利之；风邪外客而发寒热者，当发散之；外感风邪，大便闭结，烦渴痰盛者，当内疏外解。若因乳母膏梁积热者，母服东垣清胃散；若因乳母恚怒肝火者，母服加味逍遥散。禀赋阴虚者，儿服地黄丸。大概当用轻和之剂以治其本，切不可用峻利之药以伤真气也。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>　　　　　吐舌弄舌</p>
<p>　　舌属心脾二经。小儿舌微露而即收者，名弄舌，此属心脾亏损，用温脾散补之。舌舒长而良久不收者，名吐舌，乃心脾积热，用泻黄散主之。或兼口舌生疮，作渴饮冷，属胃经实热，亦用前散。作渴饮热，属胃经虚热，用四君子汤。食少作渴，或大便不实，脾胃虚弱也，用七味白朮散。口角流涎，或腮颊患肿，胃虚风热也，先用人参安胃散，次用七味白朮散。若午后甚者，脾血虚也，四物多加参、朮、茯苓；未应，用补中益气汤，及审五脏相胜。若因疳瘦所致，当参诸疳门。<br>　　　　古今医统 【明　徐春甫】</p>
<p>　　　　　口疮</p>
<p>　　口疮者，乃脾气凝滞，风热加之，则发口疮。小儿将养太过温暖，心脏客热，其口亦疮。伤寒狐惑之证，上唇生疮，虫食其脏；下唇生疮，虫食其肛。此口疮内应脏腑之邪热然也。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>　　　　证治准绳 【明　王肯堂】</p>

<p>　　又看舌下，若连舌有膜如石榴子。若啼不出、声不转，连以指爪摘断之，或用苇刀子割之。微有血出即活。若舌下血出多者，以烧乱发灰同猪脂少许和涂之。<br>　　　　　齿唇</p>

<p>　　曾氏云：木舌者，舌肿硬而妨乳食，此为风热盛也。以当归散、泻黄散、玉露饮皆可服之，次消黄散点擦舌上。盖舌者心之官，心热则生疮破裂，肝壅则血出如涌，脾闭则自胎如雪，热则肿满，风则强木，口合不开，四肢壮热，气喘语塞，即其候也。治法凉解上焦及心肝脾三经邪热，疏风化痰。初用百解散加五和汤，水姜灯心煎；次投以牛蒡汤同当归散，入生地黄，水姜煎服。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>　　　　　咽喉</p>
<p>　　《心鉴》云：咽喉为一身之总要，与胃气相接，呼吸之所从出。若胸膈之间，蕴积热毒，致生风痰，壅滞不散，发而为咽喉之病，喉内生疮，或状如肉腐，为肿为痛，窒塞不通，吐咽不下，甚则生出重舌。治之尤重先去风痰，以通咽膈，然后解其热毒，迟则有不救之患。又有热毒冲于上腭而生疮，谓之悬痈及腑寒，亦能令人咽闭，吞吐不利。临病详审治之！　　咽喉之疾，本伤热毒上攻也。四时受热，藏心腑之间，一日所触上攻咽喉，所谓肾伤寒也。然其证有单肉蛾、双肉蛾，有重舌、木舌、痄腮，有悬瘫肿胀，有里外皆肿，甚者上攻头面皆肿。大法先洗去口中舌上白胎，其次扫去风涎。如是单双肉蛾，可针则针；有不可针者，则用熏掺药退后，方依次用服药。如是木舌，服药之外，仍用掺药。痄腮则用涂药，轻者但服药而自退，不须用针及药点，其疮自消也。<a id="orig-22p" href="#trans-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>　　　　外科正宗 【明　陈实功】</p>

<p>　　鹅口疮皆心脾二经胎热上攻，致满口皆生白斑雪片，甚则咽间迭迭肿起，致难乳哺，多生啼叫。以青纱一条，裹着头上，蘸新汲水揩去白胎，以净为度，重手出血不妨，随以冰硼散搽之，内服凉膈之药。<a id="orig-23p" href="#trans-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>　　　　　重舌</p>
<p>　　小儿重舌，乃心火妄动发之。当以线针点刺患上，令出恶血，内服解毒泻心汤，外以冰硼散搽之。又有紫舌、木舌，亦由心火而发。用飞盐加冰片少许搽，出涎自愈。又有痰气结于舌上，成核作痛硬强者，用线针点破出血，用冰硼散搽之，服黄连泻心汤。<br>　　　　　走马疳</p>
<p>　　走马疳，言患迅速不可迟延故也。其患多由痧痘余毒所中，又有杂病热甚而成者。其患牙根作烂，随便黑腐作臭，甚者牙龈脱落，根柯黑朽，不数日间，以致穿腮破唇，诚为不治。初起宜用芦荟消疳饮，外用人中白散，或冰硼散二药搽之，取去黑腐肉，见红肉血流者为吉。如取时顽肉不脱，腐烂渐开，焮肿外散，臭味不止，更兼身热不退者，俱为不治。<br>　　　　　牙疳五不治</p>

<p>　　风毒湿热，随其虚处所著，搏于血气，则坐疮疡。若发于唇上生疮，乍瘥乍发，谓之紧唇，又曰沉唇。其发频者，唇常肿大粗厚，或上有疮不效，甚者以至唇腆。若发于唇里，连两颊生疮者，名曰口疮。若发于口吻两角生疮者，名曰燕口。俗云因乳食看视燕子，则生燕口疮也。<br>　　　　　弄舌论</p>
<p>　　小儿弄舌者，其证有二：一者心热。心系舌本，热则舌本干濇而紧，故时时吐弄舒缓之。二者脾热。脾络连舌，热则舌亦干濇而紧，故时时吐弄舒缓之。皆欲饮水。心热则发渴，脾热则津液耗，皆引饮。二证相似，宜加审别。心热者面赤，睡即口中气热，时时烦躁，喜就其冷，咬牙上窜，治宜退热。脾热者大便稠硬，赤黄色，面黄身亦微黄，治宜微导之，不可用冷药，又不可转下；若悞下之，则脾胃虚，津液耗，又加五心烦热，面黄肌瘦，变为疳也。若大病未已，用药后弄舌者，大凶也。以人参知母散、泻黄散治之。<a id="orig-25p" href="#trans-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>　　　　　舌病论</p>
<p>　　小儿舌上偶生疮肿者，由风毒邪热搏于血气，随其虚处着而生病也。发于舌上紫肿者，名曰紫舌胀。若肿粗大，木闷而硬者，名曰木舌胀。若风湿相搏而生疮者，名曰舌疮。若风多而舌肿如吹胞者，名曰鼓舌。其紫舌木舌鼓舌肿甚者，则满口溢出，塞闭气门，皆能杀人。<br>　　　　　咽喉病论</p>

<p>If a young child exhibits oral thrush upon emerging from the womb, their tongue will have white flakes like rice; in severe cases, these flakes may also be found in the nose. This condition arises from excessive intake of dampness from grains while in the womb, or due to the mother&#39;s craving for glutinous rice during pregnancy. To treat it, cover the head with a cloth, dab it with well water, and clean it for three days; it should then clear up. If it doesn’t, boil the juice of the chestnut&#39;s inner skin until thick, and use a cloth to dab it. In spring and summer, if chestnut inner skin is not available, you can boil the bark of the chestnut tree, applying the same method with well water.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Tongue with Membrane</h3>
<p>When a small child is born with a connected tongue, beneath the tongue there is a membrane resembling the partition of a pomegranate. This membrane connects the tongue underneath, preventing the child from speaking or moving the tongue. It can be clipped with nails, resulting in a small amount of bleeding which is not harmful; if the bleeding does not stop, it can be cauterized until it becomes ash and applied to stop the bleeding.</p>
<h3>Thick Palate and Gums</h3>
<p>When a child is six or seven days old, the blood and qi consolidate into flesh, and the mouth, tongue, throat, and cheeks become clear. If there is something in the throat or on the tongue that resembles a water-filled reed or if there are bulging abscesses, a long needle can be wrapped with cotton, with the blade left about the size of a grain of millet, to pierce it and release the qi, expelling the blue, yellow, or red blood fluid. After one puncture, if swelling remains, it can be punctured again the next day, not exceeding three punctures to completely eliminate it. If any small remnants remain, three punctures are also sufficient for them to dissipate naturally. The condition under the tongue is called &quot;thick tongue,&quot; if it is found in the cheeks and hard palate, it is called &quot;thick palate,&quot; and if it is found on the gums, it is called &quot;thick gums.&quot; All of these should have their blood fluid punctured. After puncturing, rinse with salt and immediately apply a sacred powder or a fine powdered remedy.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatise on Tooth Diseases</strong></p>
<p>In general, the exposure of the gums is often due to deficiencies (with pests hidden above and below) and lunar eclipses. Apply the ash of the horsetail at night between the gums to fill the spaces; avoid eating oils, and within two or three days, it will heal. Consuming oils and dried jujubes will provoke the issue. Therefore, those suffering from dental problems should avoid oils, dried jujubes, and cassia bark. Every morning, take a pinch of salt in your mouth, swish with warm water, and rub and tap your teeth a hundred times; do this without fail, and within five days, the teeth will be firmly set. Generally, those who cannot eat fruits and vegetables have exposed tooth roots. This method of using saltwater to clean and tap the teeth is universally effective and excellent. The tendency to suffer from dental diseases often arises from eating or drinking during lunar eclipses, so knowledgeable individuals should be especially cautious. Thus, during lunar eclipses, one should strictly avoid food and drink. The same advice applies to children.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment for Children: Playing with the Tongue</h3>
<p>Playing with the tongue indicates a slight heat in the spleen, causing the tongue&#39;s veins to become tight, necessitating frequent warmth and relaxation. One should minimize the use of Yellow Powder. If a child drinks water but has a weak spleen and stomach with reduced fluids, accompanied by a pale face, thin body, and irritability with heat in the five hearts, it indicates malnutrition; here, take Hu Huanglian pills. If the playing with the tongue occurs during a serious illness, it is ominous.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The term &quot;playing with the tongue&quot; refers to a tongue that slightly protrudes and then retracts, indicative of deficiency in the heart and spleen, which should be treated with a warming spleen powder. If the tongue is stretched out and slowly retracts while protruding, it suggests accumulated heat in the heart and spleen, for which Yellow Powder should be minimized. If there are sores on the mouth and tongue with thirst for cold drinks, it indicates excessive heat in the stomach channel, requiring Yellow Powder. If there is a thirst accompanied by aversion to cold, it signifies deficiency heat in the stomach channel, to be treated with the Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is little food intake with thirst, or loose stools, indicating weakness in the spleen and stomach, use the Seven-Flavored Atractylodes Powder. If there is drooling from the corners of the mouth or swelling in the cheeks, it may indicate spleen deficiency with wind heat, initially using Ren Shen An Wei Powder, followed by the Seven-Flavored Atractylodes Powder. If symptoms are severe in the afternoon, it suggests deficiency of spleen blood, thus the Four Substances Decoction should include more ginseng, atractylodes, and poria. One should not use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction without first assessing compatibility. For malnutrition symptoms, refer to the relevant malnutrition guidelines.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

If there is heat in the heart and spleen, leading to pain at the tip of the tongue that prevents sucking, or pain affecting the base of the tongue that hinders milk flow, apply a powder of willow blossoms. If the underside of the tongue is swollen like a small tongue, or if there is pain due to tension in the tongue veins or problems with the gums presenting white spots, use a fine needle to draw out toxic blood, and also apply the aforementioned powder. If the lips are swollen and painful, or if there are painful cracks, mix angelica ointment with the powder for application. If a severe illness causes fever and thirst for cold drinks, along with constipation, use a purging formula to relieve the heat. If the illness has left one with a fever, thirst for soup, and loose stools, use a formula to nourish the stomach qi.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

If a child eats sweet and fatty foods, or if the mother consumes wine or flour, resulting in sores on the child&#39;s mouth and tongue, use the Clear Stomach Powder to eliminate heat. If there are vomiting and reduced appetite with diarrhea, use the Atractylodes Powder to tonify the spleen. If the hands and feet are cold, or there is abdominal pain with aversion to cold, use the Six Gentlemen with roasted ginger to warm the middle. If a mother&#39;s improper diet and labor cause a fever in the child, use the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi Decoction.

Together, they are the two meridians of the intestines and stomach. If there is accumulated heat within, or due to the ingestion of toxic medicines like silver powder or large doses of croton, entering the intestines and stomach, milk and food cannot withstand the poison, leading the toxic qi to affect the gums and the delicate gaps between the teeth, causing harm. It can be treated with fragrant jade thread.

<p>Dai Yun: Wooden tongue refers to a swollen and hard tongue that lacks the softness of a normal one. A heavy tongue also belongs to this category. Both conditions are generally due to heat illness. Use a powder made from a mix of various herbs like frost, talcum, and Glauber&#39;s salt, and apply it with wine.</p>
<p><strong>Mouth Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Dai Yun: This refers to having sores throughout the mouth. Apply tea from the Jiang region and powdered herbs; alternatively, mix equal parts of苦参 (苦参),黄丹 (yellow orpiment),五倍子 (galla chinensis), and青黛 (indigo) for application.</p>

It is crucial not to use cooling medicines for treatment. A little bit of Long Nao Yin Zi and Di Huang Gao should be used. If the condition persists in a serious illness, it is ominous; practitioners should be cautious.</p>
<p><strong>Notes from the Heart</strong> (Ming era, Wan Quan)</p>
<p><strong>Lip Sores</strong></p>
<p>In children with intestinal worms, symptoms include drowsiness, irritability, a foul-smelling nose, gum sores, and black blood in diarrhea. Worms in the lower body cause sores on the lower lip, while those affecting the organs lead to sores on the upper lip.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>　　　　　鹅口口疮</p>
<p>　　巢氏曰：鹅口候者，小儿初生，口里白屑，满口上古，如鹅之口，故曰鹅口也。此乃胎热而心脾最盛，熏发于口也。葛氏用发缠指头，蘸井花水揩拭之；睡时以黄丹煅出火气，掺于舌上。小儿初出腹有连舌，舌下有膜，如石榴子中隔，连其舌下，后令儿言语不发不转也。可以爪甲摘断之，微有血出无害；若血出不止，可烧发作灰末傅之，血便止也。用保命散，枯白矾一钱，马牙硝半钱，朱砂一分，同研细，取白鹅粪以水搅取汁，调涂舌上颔颊内。先用发缠指揩拭舌上垢了，然后用药敷之。口疮候乃小儿血气盛，兼将养过温，心脏积热，熏蒸于上焦，故成口疮也。宜用南星末，淡酢调贴两脚心；乳母宜服洗心散，却用泻心汤。敷口之法，用黄连末以蜜水调抹口中。黄蘗、青黛、冰片皆可。又以牛黄少许末之，竹沥调涂口内，治鹅口。以马牙硝如豆许涂亦好。或口如鱼口不能合，或作鸦声者，难治。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Candidiasis (Thrush)</strong></p>
<p>Chao Shi said: The condition called &quot;candidiasis&quot; refers to infants at birth who have white flakes in their mouths, filling their oral cavity like that of a goose, hence the name. This occurs due to heat from the fetus, with the heart and spleen being particularly vigorous, which manifests in the mouth. Ge Shi advised using hair wrapped around the finger to dip in well water and wipe the mouth; at night, burning yellow minerals to extract heat and applying it to the tongue. If the infant has a &quot;fused tongue&quot; with membrane underneath, similar to the partitions in a pomegranate, it may cause difficulty in speaking later on. One can cut it carefully, which may produce a little blood but is not harmful; if the bleeding does not stop, one can burn the hair to ash and apply it to stop the bleeding. </p>
<p>Use the Baoming powder: one qian of dried white alum, half a qian of horse&#39;s tooth nitre, and one fen of vermilion, finely ground together. Take white goose droppings, mix it with water to extract juice, and apply it inside the mouth and on the cheeks. First, use the hair to clean off any filth on the tongue, then apply the medicine. The occurrence of mouth sores is due to the infant having an abundance of blood energy and being overly nourished, causing heat accumulation in the heart, which steams upward, resulting in mouth sores. </p>
<p>One should use powdered southern star herb mixed with light vinegar and apply it to the soles of the feet; wet-nurses should take the Xixin powder while also taking the Xiexin Decoction. For treating the mouth, use powdered huanglian mixed with honey water to apply inside. Huangbo, qingdai, and ice shavings are all effective. Additionally, using a small amount of niuhuang powdered and bamboo juice applied inside the mouth can treat candidiasis. Applying horse&#39;s tooth nitre in a bean-sized amount is also good. If the mouth resembles a fish&#39;s and cannot close, or if it makes crowing sounds, it is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>　　　　　重舌木舌弄舌</p>
<p>　　巢氏曰：小儿重舌者，心脾俱有热也。心候于舌而主血，脾之络脉出于舌下。若心脾有热，则血气俱盛，附于舌根，重生壅出如舌而短小是也。有着颊里及上腭者，名曰重腭；着齿龈者，曰重龈。皆当刺去其血，用真蒲黄敷之；或发灰、或马牙硝、或硼砂、或焰硝敷之；或竹沥浸黄蘗点之，亦好。　　又木舌证，舌者心之候，脾之脉络于舌也。脏腑壅滞，心脾积热，热气上冲，故令舌肿，渐渐胀大，塞满口中，是为木舌。若不急疗，必致害人。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Nest Family said: Children with a heavy tongue have heat in both the heart and spleen. The heart is represented by the tongue and governs the blood, while the meridians of the spleen emerge from under the tongue. When there is heat in both the heart and spleen, the blood and qi become abundant, accumulating at the root of the tongue, causing it to appear heavy, thickened, and short. If it affects the inner cheeks and upper palate, it is called a heavy palate; if it affects the gums, it is called heavy gums. In all cases, one should eliminate the blood by needling and apply true cattail pollen; alternative treatments include applying ash, horse’s tooth nitrate, borax, or alchemical nitrate; or using bamboo juice mixed with berberine for application, which is also effective.</p>
<p>Additionally, the condition referred to as a &quot;wooden tongue&quot; occurs when the tongue indicates the state of the heart and the meridians of the spleen are obstructed. With the internal organs stagnant, heat accumulates in the heart and spleen, leading the heat to surge upward and causing the tongue to swell, gradually enlarging and filling the mouth, resulting in a wooden tongue. If not treated urgently, it will surely cause harm.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Use two parts of stone nitrate, one part of purple frost, and half a part of white salt, grind them together, and mix them with half a cash of bamboo juice and well water for application. It is also acceptable not to use stone nitrate and salt. Another method involves finely grinding yellow hibiscus flowers, using half the amount of cinnabar, and grinding them together seven times for application. If the tongue swells and fills the mouth, applying just borneol is also effective. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if there is tongue movement, it indicates slight heat in the spleen, causing the tongue veins to tighten. One should relax the tongue regularly. When treating this, do not use cold medicines; instead, gradually administer yellow powder. If water consumption is suspected to be heat-related, do not use cold medicines, as this is misleading. Drinking water indicates spleen and stomach deficiency, with a lack of fluids. Additionally, if the complexion is pale and thin, accompanied by five hearts feeling hot, it indicates malnutrition and should be treated with substances like hu huanglian pills. </p>
<p>If the illness is severe and there is tongue movement after medication, it is a bad sign. For a white coating on the tongue accompanied by black spots, powder borax and mix it; if heat is severe, add borneol or simply use yellow lead the size of a bean to press under the tongue, which is particularly effective.<br>Teeth are slow to grow.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Nie said: &quot;Those who inherit insufficient kidney qi will have weak marrow. Since the marrow is what nourishes the bones, if the marrow is insufficient, it cannot reach the teeth, which is why tooth development is delayed. One should take equal parts of Chuanxiong, Gan Di Huang, Shan Yao, Dang Gui, Shao Yao, and Gan Cao, grind them into a powder, and take with warm water. Alternatively, one can rub the gum with the powdered medicine, and the teeth will grow.&quot;</p>
<p>Throat Blockage and Swelling of the Cheeks</p>
<p>Chao said: &quot;These two conditions are due to wind and poison qi affecting the throat, which combines with blood qi to form a swelling that becomes toxic. If heat enters the heart, it will lead to agitation, lack of appetite, and potentially death. For this condition, one should urgently administer Jin Xing Wan. For children with throat and cheek swelling and pain, one should use Sheng Ma, Ma Ya Xie, Borax, and Niu Huang, and Lian Qiao Decoction is essential; Lian Qiao and Lu Decoction can also be taken.&quot;</p>
<p>Stagnation in the Jaw</p>
<p>Chao said: &quot;When children have stagnation in the jaw, saliva flows out and accumulates in the jaw area. This is due to a cold spleen leading to excessive saliva. The liquid of the spleen is saliva, and when the spleen and stomach are deficient and cold, they cannot control the secretion of fluids, causing the saliva to flow out and accumulate in the jaw. Zhang&#39;s Wen Pi Dan can treat this. Another method is to use a combination of various herbs for decoction and hold them in the mouth; this will also prevent saliva from flowing out. Yi Huang San can also treat this condition, and Wen Pi San can be taken as well.&quot;</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Swollen Tongue</strong></p>
<p>For children with wind-stopping, if the tongue is swollen, there must be a “stopping worm” present, resembling a mole cricket, with fine hair on its head, which is small and white. Burning it with a heated iron can make it disappear; if not treated urgently, it can be fatal. It is said that a horse may cause throat paralysis, with the mouth full of white sores like snow, resulting from spleen deficiency. If influenced by wind evil, one should first dispel the evil and then take tonics to nourish the spleen qi and generate spleen blood. Dragon fire does not suit cooling substances; it is advisable to treat it with sweet and warm remedies.</p>
<p><strong>Stagnant Saliva</strong></p>
<p>For children with stagnant saliva, drooling occurs and seeps into the jaw area. The liquid of the spleen is saliva, which cannot be contained due to the cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach. The treatment is to use the Six Gentlemen Decoction with added patchouli. If the child is thirsty and drinks cold, it pertains to excess heat, hence, one should clear the stomach fire; if thirsty and drinking soup, it indicates deficiency heat, needing supplementation of the Middle and enhancement of qi. If there is excess heat in the spleen channel and the submandibular gland cannot regulate, use Niuhuang Qingxin Wan; if there is deficiency heat in the spleen channel, use Six Gentlemen with patchouli. For excess heat in the stomach channel causing worms to stir and fluids to flow out, use Xie Huang Powder; for heat, use Five Flavor Different Effect Powder. For constipation, use a cooling drink; for sinking middle qi, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction; if there is food accumulation and internal heat, use Da An Wan. Additionally, refer to the sections on mouth sores and swelling for further guidance.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Throat Obstruction</p>
<p>In children, throat obstruction occurs due to accumulated heat from rich foods, or due to inherent heat, or from the negative emotions of the wet nurse, or from toxic food and drink. It is important to differentiate the nature of the obstruction and its severity, and to treat according to the respective meridian it pertains to. If the left cheek appears bluish-red, it is due to wind-heat in the liver and gallbladder meridians; treat with Chai Hu and Zhi Zi powder. If the right cheek is red, there is heat in the lung meridian; treat with Xie Bai powder. If the forehead is red, it indicates heat in the heart and small intestine meridians; use Dao Chi powder. If there is also a bluish tint, it suggests a combination of wind and heat, and treat with a modified Xiao Yao powder. If there is a yellow color between the nostrils, it indicates obstruction in the spleen and stomach meridians; treat with Xie Huang powder. If there is also a bluish color, it implies wood overcoming earth; use modified Xiao Yao powder. If red, it indicates the heart&#39;s influence over the earth; treat with Chai Hu and Zhi Zi powder. If there is redness on the chin, it suggests heat in the kidney meridian; use Di Huang pills. In cases where there is accumulated heat internally and difficulty with urination and defecation, the treatment should alleviate and open these pathways. If there is an external wind pathogen causing chills and fever, it should be expelled. If wind pathogen is present along with constipation and excessive thirst and phlegm, internal release and external resolution are needed. If the obstruction is due to heat accumulated from the wet nurse&#39;s rich diet, the mother should take Dong Yuan&#39;s Clear Stomach powder; if caused by her anger and liver fire, she should take modified Xiao Yao powder. If the child is constitutionally yin deficient, they should take Di Huang pills. Generally, mild and harmonious medications should be used to treat the underlying condition, avoiding harsh and damaging drugs that harm the vital energy.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Tongue Play and Tongue Projection</strong></p>
<p>The tongue is associated with the heart and spleen meridians. When a child’s tongue slightly shows and then retracts immediately, it is called tongue play, indicating deficiency of the heart and spleen, to be treated with warming spleen powders. When the tongue extends and remains out for a long time, it is called tongue projection, which signifies accumulation of heat in the heart and spleen, to be addressed with purging yellow powders. If accompanied by sores in the mouth and thirst for cold drinks, this belongs to excess heat in the stomach meridian, and the same powders are used. If there is thirst for warm beverages, it indicates deficiency heat in the stomach meridian, to be treated with Four Gentlemen Decoction. If there is little food intake leading to thirst, or loose stools, it reflects weakness of the spleen and stomach, requiring Seven Flavor White Atractylodes Powder. If there is salivation at the corners of the mouth or swelling in the cheeks, it indicates wind-heat in a weak stomach; first, use Ginseng to Calm the Stomach Powder, then apply Seven Flavor White Atractylodes Powder. If the condition is severe in the afternoon, it suggests blood deficiency in the spleen; add more ginseng, atractylodes, and poria to the Four Substances Decoction. If it occurs due to malnutrition, reference should be made to the guidelines for malnourishment.</p>
<p><strong>Mouth Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Mouth ulcers arise from stagnation of spleen qi, exacerbated by wind-heat, leading to their appearance. Children who are overly warmed and nourished may also have sores due to heat in the heart. In cases of febrile diseases, sores appearing on the upper lip indicate internal evil heat affecting the organs; sores on the lower lip signify internal heat harming the anus. These mouth ulcers are indeed connected to the evil heat from the internal organs.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Evidence and Treatment Criteria</h3>
<h4>Mouth</h4>
<p>When an infant is newly born, it is urgent to wrap it in soft cloth and wipe away the foul blood and impurities from its mouth and tongue, referred to as &quot;jade clasped.&quot; If the infant cries out, it will lead to various ailments.</p>
<h4>Tongue</h4>
<p>Next, examine under the tongue. If there is a membrane connecting the tongue like a pomegranate seed, and if the child does not cry or there is no change in voice, use your fingernail to cut it or use a reed knife to slice it. A slight amount of blood indicates vitality. If there is a significant amount of blood underneath the tongue, mix burnt fine ashes with a little pig fat and apply it.</p>
<h4>Teeth and Lips</h4>
<p>The &quot;Holy Benefit&quot; states: Observe the roots of the teeth; if there are two yellow veins, use a reed knife to sever them and apply pig&#39;s milk. If the child&#39;s eyes are hard to open, first apply pig&#39;s milk. The upper lip is connected to the gums by a vein. If the vein connecting the upper lip is tight, it causes conditions in the upper region; if the vein for the lower lip is tight, it leads to conditions in the lower region. Conditions in the upper part can result in sores that appear on the head or between the brows, resembling scabs. If itching persists and yellow fluid seeps out, sores will develop. Conditions arising from the lower part can affect the waist and back, eventually reaching the limbs, manifesting similarly as above. If severe cases are untreated, or if symptoms affect both head and face, it may lead to prolonged illness or even death. Daily morning mouth wiping is recommended.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Mouth and Tongue Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Mouth ulcers in children occur due to irregular breastfeeding, or from the mother consuming rich foods that generate heat, or from the emotions of the wet nurse causing fire. The symptoms appear on the lips, tongue, and gums resembling ulcers. If there is fever and thirst with a desire for cold drinks, a red complexion on the forehead, and a rapid left pulse, this indicates a heart issue. First, use Daohong San to clear heart fire, then use Di Huang Wan to nourish kidney water. If there are alternating chills and fever, with a blue-red left cheek and a taut and rapid left pulse, this relates to the liver channel. First, use Chai Hu Zhi Zi San to clear liver fire, then use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to nourish liver blood. If both cheeks are yellow-red, the gums are decaying, the stool has a sour smell, and the right pulse is rapid yet soft, it indicates a spleen issue. Use Si Wei Fei Er Wan to treat spleen fire, and Wu Wei Yi Gong San to tonify spleen qi. If there is fever and coughing, with a red right cheek and a rapid right pulse that feels thin on palpation, this indicates a lung issue. First, use Qing Fei Yin to treat lung fire, and Wu Wei Yi Gong San to nourish the spleen and stomach. If there is fever and thirst, both cheeks are dark, and the left pulse is rapid, it shows deficiency in the kidney channel. First, use Liu Wei Di Huang Wan to produce kidney water, then use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang to generate lung qi. </p>
<p>There is also a condition called &quot;running horse dampness,&quot; which arises from damage to the spleen and stomach qi and blood after illness, leading to deficiency fire rising, or due to residual poison from measles attacking upward. The disease progresses rapidly and requires urgent use of Tonglu San and Da Wu Yi Tang. In mild cases, this leads to rotten gums and swollen lips and cheeks; in severe cases, the gums erode, and the cheeks and jaws become extensively decayed.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Tongue</strong></p>
<p>The tongue is a messenger of the heart and a channel of the spleen. When the two meridians retain heat without being released, it manifests in the tongue. If the tongue&#39;s veins feel slightly tense and one relaxes the tongue frequently, it is called &quot;playing with the tongue.&quot; If there is a growth underneath the tongue close to the root that resembles a small tongue, it is referred to as &quot;heavy tongue.&quot; If the tongue swells and fills the mouth, it is known as &quot;wood tongue.&quot; </p>
<p>The Zeng family states that all conditions related to this are due to the spleen, heart, and liver having been subjected to extreme heat, which is what is referred to as &quot;heavy tongue&quot; and &quot;wood tongue.&quot; They are also called &quot;yellow tongue&quot; and &quot;duck&#39;s mouth.&quot; Although the names differ, they all signify heat. Generally, the heavy tongue appears beneath the tongue, protruding like a tongue, hence it is called &quot;heavy tongue.&quot; The spleen&#39;s channels are linked to the side of the tongue, the liver&#39;s channels connect to the base of the tongue, and the heart&#39;s channels are linked to the root of the tongue.</p>
<p>If these three meridians are affected by damp heat or wind-cold, the tongue may curl, retract, stretch, or swell. It would be appropriate to use &quot;Xiao Huang San&quot; and &quot;Lu Pao San&quot; as treatments, along with &quot;Dang Gui San&quot; and &quot;Qiang Huo San&quot; to administer.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

If it does not improve, later use true pu huang to dress it; it will heal in no more than three applications. Lightly fry true pu huang, spread it on paper, release the heat, grind it finely, and use some to apply to the tongue. Then take warm water, dip a fine cloth, wrap your finger, and gently press it down; after pressing, apply the medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Wooden Tongue</strong></p>
<p>Zeng says: A wooden tongue is swollen and hard, hindering milk and food intake, indicating excessive wind-heat. Remedies such as Dang Gui San, Xie Huang San, and Yu Lu Yin can be taken; then apply Xie Huang San to rub on the tongue. The tongue is the organ of the heart; if the heart is heated, it will cause ulcers and cracks; if the liver is congested, blood will surge out; if the spleen is obstructed, it will be like snow from the fetus; if hot, it will swell; if windy, it will be strong and wooden, making the mouth close and difficult to open, limbs will feel strong heat, and there will be wheezing and speech difficulties—these are the signs. The treatment method involves cooling and resolving the upper jiao and the evil heat in the heart, liver, and spleen meridians, dispersing wind and transforming phlegm. Initially use Bai Jie San combined with Wu He Tang, boiled with ginger and distilled lotus seed; then add Burdock Soup together with Dang Gui San, adding raw Rehmannia and brewing with ginger for consumption.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Throat</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Heart Mirror&quot; states: The throat is the crucial part of the body, connected with the stomach qi, and the place from which breathing emerges. If in the chest and diaphragm there accumulates heat and toxins, leading to the generation of wind-phlegm, which becomes stagnant and unresolved, it manifests as diseases of the throat—ulcers may form inside the throat, or appear as decayed flesh, resulting in swelling and pain, creating an obstruction that hinders swallowing, and in severe cases, a heavy tongue may develop. In treatment, it is essential to first eliminate wind-phlegm to clear the throat and diaphragm, and then resolve the heat and toxins; if treatment is delayed, serious consequences may ensue. Moreover, if heat toxins invade the soft palate causing ulcers, it is known as hanging sore or intestinal cold, which can also lead to throat closure and difficulty in swallowing. When faced with illness, treat it diligently!</p>
<p>The diseases of the throat mainly stem from the attack of heat toxins. Throughout the seasons, these can harm the heart and viscera, and daily exposures can attack the throat, this is referred to as kidney cold injury. Symptoms include single or double flesh worms, heavy tongue, wooden tongue, mumps, and hanging swellings; severe cases may cause swelling of the head and face from the upward attack. The general principle is first to cleanse the white coating on the tongue, then to dispel wind saliva. For single or double flesh worms, if they are suitable for needling, then needle them; if they are unsuitable, use fumigating powders to retreat them, afterwards apply internal medications. For wooden tongue, aside from taking medicines, continue using medicinal powders. In cases of mumps, apply topical medications; mild cases may resolve with just oral medications, without the need for needling or medicinal points, allowing the ulcers to heal on their own.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p>A child&#39;s heavy tongue is caused by excessive heart fire.

There are also conditions like purple tongue and wood tongue, which arise from heart fire.

<h3>Running Horse Sore</h3>
<p>The term &quot;Running Horse Sore&quot; indicates a rapid onset that cannot be delayed. It often arises from residual toxins of measles and smallpox, as well as from excessive heat of various diseases. The symptoms include rotten gums, black decay that emits a foul smell, and, in severe cases, loss of gums with roots turning black and decaying. Within a few days, this can lead to perforated cheeks and split lips, making it truly difficult to cure. At the onset, it is advisable to use Aloe Vera Decoction to dispel the sore, and externally apply Ren Zhong Bai Powder or Ice Borax Powder to remove black necrotic tissue, revealing red flesh and flowing blood, which is a good sign. If stubborn meat does not fall away, rotting continues to open, swelling spreads outward, and the foul odor persists along with persistent body heat, it is considered incurable.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Lip Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Wind, toxin, dampness, and heat attach themselves where there is deficiency. When they interact with the blood and qi, they cause sores and ulcers. If they appear on the lips as sores that intermittently heal and then reappear, it is called &quot;tight lips&quot; or &quot;heavy lips.&quot; If they occur frequently, the lips become swollen and thick, sometimes even with lingering sores, leading to lip deformity. If they arise inside the lips, forming sores that connect to both cheeks, it is referred to as &quot;oral sores.&quot; If they occur at the corners of the mouth, they are called &quot;swallow&#39;s mouth.&quot; It is commonly said that this is due to dairy and food observing swallows, which causes swallow&#39;s mouth sores.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Tongue Manipulation</strong></p>
<p>When young children manipulate their tongues, there are two indications: one is heart heat. The heart is connected to the root of the tongue; when it is hot, the root becomes dry and tense, prompting the child to frequently stick out their tongue in a relaxed manner. The second is spleen heat. The spleen is connected to the tongue; when it is hot, the tongue also becomes dry and tense, leading to the same behavior. Both cases cause a desire for water. Heart heat results in thirst, while spleen heat causes depletion of fluids, which both provoke drinking. These two conditions are similar and should be examined carefully. A child with heart heat has a red face, experiences heat in the mouth while sleeping, is often restless, prefers coolness, and may grind their teeth. Treatment should focus on reducing heat. A child with spleen heat has hard, yellow stools, a yellowish face, and slight bodily jaundice; treatment should involve gentle guiding, avoiding cold medicines and excessive purging. If forcefully purged, it can lead to spleen and stomach deficiency, fluid depletion, and aggravate the child&#39;s restlessness and emaciation, ultimately resulting in malnutrition. If tongue manipulation occurs after a serious illness and medication, it is a very bad sign. Treatment with Ginseng Zhimu Powder and Xiahuang Powder is recommended.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

The &quot;Medical Regulations of Ancient and Modern&quot; states: For children with a milk hiccup, use a needle to prick the Shaoshang point for one fen, followed by moxibustion for one bunch. Shaoshang is on the inner side of the tip of the big toe, one should avoid the nail edge like chives, locating it at the white flesh, where the lung meridian emerges, called Jingmu. For a milk hiccup, needle the Hegu point for three fen, followed by moxibustion for three bunches. Hegu, also known as the Tiger&#39;s Mouth, is found in the depression between the first and second metacarpal bones of the hand, where the Yangming large intestine meridian runs through.</p>
<p>For children aged five to six who do not speak, it indicates insufficient heart energy; the root of the tongue lacks strength, causing difficulty in articulation. Moxibustion should be applied to the Xinshu point for three bunches, located one and a half inches lateral to the two sides below the fifth vertebra. For children with acute throat obstruction, moxibustion should be applied to the Tiantu point for one bunch, located three inches below the Adam&#39;s apple. The &quot;Young Children’s Compendium&quot; states: If a child suffers from throat worms, use a silver needle to puncture the top of the head; once blood flows, they will recover.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Wan family&#39;s &quot;Pediatric Exploration&quot; states: A child suffers from sores on the mouth and tongue. The doctor prescribed various medications containing Scutellaria, Coptis, and other similar drugs, to no effect. I said this is caused by heat in the heart. Bitter herbs enter the heart and further support its heat, hence they are ineffective. I then formulated a &quot;Heart-Cleansing Powder,&quot; and after one dose, the child was calm.</p>
<p>My nephew had sores all around his mouth, affecting the throat, lips, and tongue. I used one qian of Herba Coptidis and Radix Scutellariae, five fen of vermilion and white alum, and three fen of roasted pill millipede, ground them finely, and applied it as a poultice. It worked immediately; this is indeed a marvelous remedy.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Family Medical Records&quot; states: A small child played with his tongue and had convulsions; his fingers were not cold. I diagnosed this as a deficiency of liver and spleen with heat, treated with a modified Yigong Powder combined with Cimicifuga and Bupleurum, leading to recovery. Later, he suffered from abdominal distention after feeding on milk; when treated with a purgative, he exhibited convulsions again. After checking the wet nurse, who had excessive liver fire, I used Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with added Cimicifuga and Atractylodes, and both mother and child recovered.</p>
<p>Another small child, having consumed too much milk, experienced vomiting and diarrhea. I prescribed a large dose of Yigong Powder with added Bupleurum and Cimicifuga, and both mother and child recovered. Later, due to fright, he took several precious pills, which caused convulsions and tongue movements, nearly leading to chronic convulsions. I then administered Liu Junzi Decoction with added Aconitum and he recovered.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

<p>A young child experiences fever, drinks cold water, has yellow stools, and both hands and feet feel hot, making it impossible for him to suckle.

I used &quot;Xie Huang&quot; and &quot;Qing Wei&quot; powders, with both mother and child taking a dose, resulting in recovery. Later, due to the wet nurse consuming alcohol, the child became restless and drooled. I again used the previous two powders, leading to recovery.</p>

<p>Children&#39;s diseases of the chest and back.</p>
<p>Children&#39;s Due Treatise [by Qian Yi of the Song Dynasty]</p>
<p>“Curved Chest and Curved Back”</p>
<p>Curved chest and curved back occur when a child is afflicted by wind that invades the spine and enters the marrow, resulting in a curved back. If there is lung heat and fullness attacking the chest and diaphragm, it leads to a curved chest. Use turtle urine to apply to the joints for self-healing. The method of obtaining the urine involves placing a tortoise on blue lotus leaves and using a mirror to reflect it, causing the urine to flow out.</p>
<p>[Note: A child&#39;s vital energy is not fully developed, and their skin pores are not tightly sealed, allowing wind evil to penetrate. Alternatively, phlegm and heat can accumulate in the lungs, hence the attack of wind and heat leading to these symptoms; or the child may have been exposed to wind too early, resulting in the invasion into the marrow. Treatment should primarily focus on nourishing the spleen and lungs. If the condition arises due to the mother’s consumption of rich and spicy foods, her treatment should also be addressed. If it is due to constitutional deficiency of the father&#39;s liver and kidney heat, Liu Wei Di Huang Wan should be used. If it is due to a deficiency of kidney qi, Ba Wei Di Huang Wan should be used.] </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When a child fails to grow, or if they are able to walk but their legs are weak, it indicates a deficiency of the胎 (prenatal essence). </p>
<p>Children who walk late may have deficient liver and kidney, and those who are unable to walk as they grow may also have this condition; some may exhibit weakness in their liver qi and experience cramps in their hands and feet. If the liver and kidneys are both weak, they cannot extend their legs. The remedy is to use the Rehmannia Six Formula for nourishment.</p>
<p>The condition of &quot;turtle chest&quot; refers to a swollen, elevated chest that resembles a turtle, indicating lung heat. This can be treated with a modified Gengzhi Pill. In the case of children with turtle chest due to lung heat, administering this modified formula can bring about miraculous results. </p>
<p>The condition of &quot;turtle back&quot; presents as a hunched posture resembling a turtle shell, which is caused by external wind affecting the spine and entering the marrow. This often leads to a chronic ailment. Moxibustion should be applied to the two points next to the third vertebra and the two points next to the second vertebra, one and a half cun away from the spine. While this method works, it may not always yield results. The Zhiqiao Pill should be used. Turtle back is a severe condition marked by kidney wind entering the marrow. Internal consumption of the Zhiqiao Pill and moxibustion should be done consecutively.</p>
<p>What is meant by walking late? Bones are nourished by marrow, and if blood and qi do not sufficiently fill the marrow, the bones become weak and soft, leading to an inability to walk. This arises from both kidney and liver deficiency. Since the liver governs the tendons, weakness in the tendons prevents early walking; the kidney governs the bones, and weak bones cannot be strong. The remedy is to use the modified Rehmannia Six Formula. </p>
<p>When both the liver and kidney are deficient, leading to inadequate walking capability, since the liver governs tendons and the kidney governs bones, replenishing the qi and blood of both meridians can be achieved by using the modified Rehmannia formula for assistance.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Turtle Chest and Turtle Back</strong>  </p>
<p>The condition known as &quot;Turtle Chest and Turtle Back&quot; primarily requires the adjustment and supplementation of the spleen and lungs, with an addition of clearing heat and resolving phlegm. If it is due to the nursing mother consuming rich and thick foods, the mother should take a stomach-clearing powder, and the child should also take a small amount.  </p>
<p><strong>Crane Knee Wind</strong>  </p>
<p>&quot;Crane Knee Wind&quot; refers to legs that are thin, with knees that are thicker, resembling a crane&#39;s knee, hence the name. This condition arises from insufficient kidney energy, allowing external pathogens to invade. Initially, there is pain inside the knee, with no change in external color, and difficulty in bending or stretching. If within one or two months it swells, turns red, and produces pus, it can be treated; if it is hard, white, and does not produce pus, it is difficult to treat. For early cases, use &quot;Major Fangfeng Decoction&quot; as the main remedy, supplementary with &quot;Qi-boosting and Nourishing Decoction&quot;; for advanced cases, use &quot;Middle Qi Tonifying Decoction&quot; with &quot;Major Fangfeng Decoction&quot; as a supplement, and be cautious not to use drugs that promote qi dispersal. If not resolved or if symptoms like fever appear, the spleen and stomach should be adjusted and supplemented well; otherwise, it will definitely worsen.  </p>

<p><strong>Turtle Chest</strong></p>
<p>The condition known as Turtle Chest is due to heat in the lungs causing fullness, which results in phlegm. It is advised to avoid breaking up the qi and dispersing it, as this may weaken the lungs; instead, one should avoid retention and seek to descend qi and eliminate phlegm.</p>
<p><strong>Standard for Diagnosis and Treatment</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang]</p>
<p><strong>Turtle Chest</strong></p>
<p>According to Zhang, if a wet nurse feeds an infant, it is common to squeeze out any stagnant milk; in summer, it is important to wash the milk clean and squeeze out the hot milk. Allowing the infant to drink hot milk can damage lung qi, leading to a swelling and fullness in the chest, which can make the chest rise high like a turtle, hence the name Turtle Chest. According to Zeng, this condition arises from wind and phlegm accumulating in the heart and chest, and subsequently, from exposure to wind and heat. The lungs, being the canopy of all organs, reside above the diaphragm. If water and qi overflow, the lungs become distended and, over time, solidify into phlegm, stagnating in the heart and chest. When compounded by internal wind and heat, external symptoms manifest as red lips and a flushed face, accompanied by cough and shortness of breath, causing the sternum to rise as if covered by a palm, termed Turtle Chest. The method of treatment is to relax the lungs, transform phlegm, and benefit the diaphragm to eliminate phlegm from the lung meridian. Initially, one should use the Wuling Powder mixed with a soothing qi decoction, combined with ginger juice and scallion broth for administration; next, utilize Qingfei Decoction, Xionghuang Powder, Biyu Pills, and Ruyi Ointment for treatment. If the initial medicine cures the condition but it recurs, if the transformation directs phlegm and saliva upwards, combined with seizures, it becomes difficult to treat.</p>
<p><strong>Turtle Back</strong></p>
<p>If the child sits up too early and windy conditions affect the spine, the wind can reach the marrow, causing the back to elevate like a turtle. Although there are many prescriptions, they often become chronic ailments, and moxibustion is crucial. It should be treated within the first hundred days.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Delayed Walking</strong></p>
<p>Zhang said: Generally, a child must reach three hundred sixty days old, with knee bones formed, before they can walk. In recent times, many children are unable to walk due to their parents&#39; insufficient vitality and blood, which weakens the fetal energy, resulting in weak bones and muscles, making it impossible to take steps. The use of deer antler has proven effective. Tang stated that for children who cannot walk, the treatment should utilize Qian&#39;s Kidney Tonic with Rehmannia pills, adding deer antler, bark of Wu Jia, and musk. My nephew Huang Zhiluo&#39;s son could not walk at three years old; after taking this recipe, it yielded results.</p>
<p><strong>Medicine for Beginners</strong> (Ming Era, Li Zhan)</p>
<p><strong>Hands and Feet</strong></p>
<p>Weak hands cannot move effectively. This results from weak liver, causing the tendons in both hands to retract without being able to extend. The treatment is Yi Yi Wan. Weak and slow-moving feet signify insufficient bone marrow, inadequate qi and blood, and weak tendons that cannot support the bones. The remedy should be Kidney Qi Pills combined with Niu Xi, Wu Jia Pei, and deer antler. For those who cannot walk at five or six years old, sheep horn pills are recommended; for those unable to walk by three years old, use one tael of Wu Jia Pei, five qian each of Niu Xi and Mu Guo, ground into powder, and taken with a small amount of rice drink mixed with a bit of alcohol. For toes that curl and lack strength to extend, the remedy is Hai Tong San. Cases of &quot;crane joints wind,&quot; commonly known as &quot;drumstick wind,&quot; arise from kidney deficiency and depletion of essence, being attacked by wind evil. This leads to the skin not being nourished, gradually becoming withered, like a crane&#39;s joint. The suitable treatment is Kidney Qi Pills combined with Wu Jia Pei, deer antler, and Niu Xi.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Turtle Chest</strong></p>
<p>When the lung meridian is heated, the chest swells high and is full, resembling a turtle&#39;s chest. For mild cases, administer Xie Bai San with Shan Zhi and Tian Men Dong; for severe cases, use Bai He Dan. Strictly avoid foods that are pungent, alcoholic, roasted, or stir-fried.</p>
<p><strong>Turtle Back</strong></p>
<p>When wind and cold invade the spinal cord, the back becomes tall like a turtle. This should be treated with Er Huo San. Apply moxibustion to the lung shu point, located on the sides below the third thoracic vertebra; and to the diaphragm shu point, below the seventh thoracic vertebra, with three to five moxibustion applications each. There are also cases of early sitting leading to stooped posture, which can be treated with Liu Wei Wan combined with Yi Ren, Mu Gua, Dang Gui, and Rou Gui.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Walking</strong></p>
<p>Delayed walking is associated with deficiencies in both the liver and kidneys. The kidneys govern the bones; if they are deficient, the marrow does not fill the bones, leading to weakness and difficulty in walking. The liver governs the tendons; if it is deficient, the blood does not nourish the tendons, causing weakness and inability to support the bones. This condition should be treated with Hu Jing Wan.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Di Huang Wan</strong><br>[From &quot;Xiao Er Zhi Jue,&quot; same below]<br>Treats kidney deficiency and symptoms like delayed movement or speech. </p>
<p>Ingredients:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shu Di Huang (Processed Rehmannia Root)</strong> - 8 qian, washed with wine; nourishes kidney water, enriches true yin, replenishes blood and generates essence.  </li>
<li><strong>Shan Zhu Yu (Cornelian Cherry Fruit)</strong> - supplements the kidneys and enhances essence.  </li>
<li><strong>Gan Shen Yao (Dried Chinese Yam)</strong> - 4 qian each; cool and nourishing.  </li>
<li><strong>Mu Dan Pi (Tree Peony Bark)</strong> - cools the kidneys and drains the fire from within the yin; treats bone steaming due to lack of sweat in the Shaoyin.  </li>
<li><strong>Ze Xie (Alisma)</strong> - nourishes yin and enters the kidney channel.  </li>
<li><strong>Bai Fu Ling (Poria)</strong> - 3 qian each, enters the Ren and Gui.</li>
</ul>
<p>The prepared Shu Di Huang is ground into a paste, and the others are powdered, mixed with refined honey to form pills the size of tung seeds, taking 20 to 30 pills at a time with warm water on an empty stomach. Xue Ji said: This formula primarily treats the kidney channel, addressing symptoms of deficiency heat, such as thirst, painful urination, phlegm and gas obstruction; blood deficiency in the liver channel causing dryness and heat, leading to wind-heat afflictions like scrofula and tuberculosis; spasms in the limbs, eyelid twitching; lung channel deficiency heat causing cough, blood expectoration, dizziness; dry and painful throat, sores on tongue and lips; heart blood deficiency with heat causing night sweats and blood in the stool; spleen deficiency causing damp heat affecting the kidneys, leading to weakness in the lower back and knees; or symptoms of skin diseases like scabies and sores. This formula serves as a primary remedy, supplemented with medicinal agents for other organs. Overall, this remedy is based on the essence of celestial water. If one is constitutionally weak, with emaciated limbs, loss of speech, or experiences fear of light with prolapsus, five delays and five weaknesses, kidney and liver deficiencies, or premature sexual engagement leading to depletion of essence and energy in all five organs, all symptoms of deficiency should use this to nourish and revitalize.

<p>Acupuncture and Moxibustion</p>
<p>Tian said: For a child with a turtle chest, take one and a half inches from each breast, above the two rows and between three bones, applying three moxibustion at each of the six points, the size of a wheat grain. In spring and summer, apply moxibustion from the bottom up, and in autumn and winter, from the top down. Zhuang said: For a turtle chest, take one斗 of ash from nine families, place it in a winnowing basket, and have the child press their face to leave a mark on the chest. Apply moxibustion to the chest mark—above, the center, and on both sides—with three people each igniting the ash. Dispose of the ash in a river or water. The &quot;Holy Benefits&quot; mentions: For a child with a turtle back, apply moxibustion one and a half inches on each side beneath the third vertebra for the lung point, beneath the fifth vertebra for the heart point, and beneath the seventh vertebra for the diaphragm point. The child&#39;s middle fingertip is considered one inch. Each moxibustion should be the size of a small wheat grain, and perform three to five applications before halting. This method used repeatedly shows effectiveness in about one out of ten or twelve cases, but full efficacy is not guaranteed. The &quot;Precious Mirror&quot; states: For a child several years old who does not walk, apply moxibustion three times on each ankle.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Brain and Apoplexy Classic&quot; states: The grandson of Fu Dianzheng, with a turtle-like back, was treated with moxibustion in the spring of the Xin-Hai year of Shao-Xi, and there was immediate effect. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Young Pediatrics Expanded&quot; by the Wan family, it is recorded: A female scholar from Huangzhou was startled, and her right thumb was bent and could not straighten. The doctor used whole scorpions and silkworms to treat it, but to no effect. She asked me for a treatment method. The liver governs the tendons, and the tendons depend on blood for nourishment, thus it is said that the palm obtains blood and is capable of bending. When the blood is dry, the tendons wither and cannot straighten. The thumb is governed by the Tai Yin channel; metal is inherently dry, and treating it with wind-inducing medicine only exacerbates the dryness. Liu Zonghou said: Avoid treating wind and dryness; one must treat the fire when the wind and dryness are present. Thus, I prescribed a formula: ginseng solidifying base pills with added huangqin, huangbo, and zhimu, to be taken in pill form.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Heart Method of Surgery&quot; states: A three-year-old child suffers from pain in the arm due to toxic heat. After taking detoxification pills and applying Shen Gong powder, the condition improves. In cases of constipation or restlessness, taking the Five Blessings Detoxification Pill is also effective. If pus forms, it should be urgently lanced and treated with paper twisted and dipped in sesame oil, then covered with a medicated plaster. If the child is calm, there’s no need for medication; wait for the pus to drain and continue with the dressing. For children whose sores do not heal or recur, it is often due to the mother consuming roasted spicy foods or having heat disorders. It is advisable to first treat the mother&#39;s heat by adding Lülu decoction to her medicine, which will also help heal the child&#39;s sores. If the child is unable to take the medicine directly, add Lülu to the medicine for the mother, and the child&#39;s sores will also heal.</p>
<p>One child suffered from smallpox and discomfort in the arm, which would recur upon pressure. This was due to painful swelling, thus it was lanced, and the internal medicine was administered, leading to recovery. After smallpox, if there is swelling in the limbs and joints without redness, a decoction of honeysuckle and fine yellow soybean flour mixed with hot water can be applied, which will moisten and promote resolution. If after six or seven days there is no resolution and pus has formed, it should be lanced immediately, and the internal medicine should be taken.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials for Infant Care&quot; states: I foolishly treated a child who was thin, with slender legs and unable to walk, whose teeth were not sturdy and whose hair was sparse and short, indicating deficiency in the three Yin pathways.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A three-year-old child is unable to walk, has sparse teeth and hair, a thin body, fever and thirst, dark eyes with few pupils, and does not respond to the fat baby pills. This indicates a deficiency in the kidneys leading to malnutrition. The previous pills are meant for the spleen and stomach, but long-term use will increase the kidney deficiency and worsen the malnutrition. If one does not believe, the teeth and hair will gradually fall out. Using the Six-Flavor Pill combined with deer antler and schisandra will lead to recovery in half a year.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child has a left leg that is thin and short by an inch, has difficulty walking, and has more white than black in the eyes, possibly experiencing night sweats and yellow, grain-like hair. The treatment involves using the rehmannia pill with deer antler and schisandra as the main ingredients, supplemented by a middle qi-boosting decoction. After half a year, the child walks as before.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Xue&#39;s Medical Cases,&quot; a fifteen-year-old child has weak and soft hands and feet, cannot bite hard items, experiences internal heat and afternoon fevers, and has difficulty with urination resembling a dribble. Taking diuretic medications causes the urination to dribble; taking yin-replenishing medicines exacerbates the internal heat; taking damp-drying medicines results in heavy and sluggish bowel movements. I believe this stems from an insufficient kidney essence, early exposure to lust. Hence, the &quot;Essence and Blood&quot; chapter states: For a man, if his essence is not full and he engages with women to release it, there will be deficiency in the five organs, leading to difficulties later on. An elderly man with diminished yin who craves lust to release his essence will be unable to expel it, leading to internal decay, painful and dribbling urination. If the yin is consumed and then further depleted, it will cause pain in both urination and defecation; the more pain, the more frequent the urination, and the more frequent the urination, the more pain. This situation aptly describes the condition.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

<p>Then, there was digestive stagnation with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but there was no tenderness upon palpation; this indicated injury to the spleen and stomach. I used the Liu Jun Zi Decoction added with Mu Xiang and Rou Dou Kou to treat it. Although the vomiting had not ceased, the left and right radial pulses were assessed lightly and were full. When palpated, they felt empty. The classics say: the kidneys open to the two yin. I used the Schisandra fruit powder for four doses, and the bowel movements suddenly ceased; afterwards, there was further food injury leading to sour regurgitation and diarrhea with heavy bowel movements. In the morning, I took the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and in the evening, the Liu Jun Zi Decoction with Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang, and I was cured.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A nine-year-old boy suffered from leg pain. Using the scallion poultice and the major wind-cold decoction, the swelling turned red. He was given the immortal life-prolonging drink and the tonifying middle and benefiting qi decoction alternately, and the swelling gradually reduced. He was also given the angelica and sclerotia decoction, combined with the tonifying middle and benefiting qi decoction; after two to three days and one poultice with scallion, it disappeared after over two months.</p>
<p>Another child had a serious ulcer that wouldn&#39;t heal. He was weak, ate little, felt dry and hot, especially in the afternoon. This was a severe deficiency of spleen qi. Five doses of the tonifying middle and benefiting qi decoction were given to replenish the original qi, followed by one dose of the major wind-cold decoction to treat the ulcer.

<p>A third child had a non-healing ulcer, with intermittent chills and fever, and dark, painful urination, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi.

<p>A girl had pain in her left leg and took remedies for qi flow. Her left knee was swollen and hard, and she was coughing up phlegm.

As both the substantial body and the harmful qi were deficient, the primary focus should be on tonifying the spleen and stomach. Not believing this, she continued to attack the pathogenic qi, causing a flare-up of symptoms. I first used a modified five-flavor decoction with added schizonepeta, dried ginger, and cinnamon to strengthen her spleen qi, followed by different techniques, including the eight-treasure decoction, which led to discharge; then an alternating regimen of the major wind-cold decoction and earth yellow pill helped her recover.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A young child experiences swelling in both knees. After applying various disinfectant medications, the feet and ankles become red and swollen. This is due to the child&#39;s inherited deficiency in kidney qi; therefore, using a formula like the Eight Treasures Decoction with Rehmannia will help reduce the swelling. If techniques to dispel pathogenic qi or other such medications are used, it will certainly lead to a failure in recovery.</p>
<p>According to the &quot;Essential Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment,&quot; if a child has a foot injury causing pain without change in flesh color, the injury involves the bone. Frequent application of fried scallions compresses the area, and during the early morning hours, they can take a blood-regulating pain relief pill. During the day, herbal formulas to strengthen the spleen and invigorate qi and blood should be administered. After several months, taking Rehmannia pills for over three months leads to recovery.</p>
<p>In another case, a child dislocates the arm bone, resulting in swelling, pain, and fever. Using medications to dispel pathogenic qi is quite effective, but appetite decreases. I applied scallions to relieve the pain, which stopped immediately. Using the Six Gentlemen Decoction, astragalus, bupleurum, platycodon, dicentra, and fracture herbs helped improve appetite and reduce swelling. Furthermore, using the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi formula with Schisandra and the Five Flavors allowed the qi and blood to harmonize, leading to the resolution of heat and recovery.</p>
<p>A child experiences a sprain, with swelling around the ankle and weakness in form and energy. I intend to focus on treating them primarily by tonifying qi and blood while assisting with herbal formulas for dispersion. However, they opted for oral intake of dispersing medications and external application of cold herbs, as if they were suffering from alternating fever and chill. I noted that the symptoms of severe chills and fever, along with a strong pulse, indicated extreme qi and blood deficiency; thus, treatment yielded no results. Eventually, internal decay drained all qi and blood, leading to the child&#39;s demise.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a></p></div>

If there is something in the throat or on the tongue that resembles a water-filled reed or if there are bulging abscesses, a long needle can be wrapped with cotton, with the blade left about the size of a grain of millet, to pierce it and release the qi, expelling the blue, yellow, or red blood fluid. After one puncture, if swelling remains, it can be punctured again the next day, not exceeding three punctures to completely eliminate it. If any small remnants remain, three punctures are also sufficient for them to dissipate naturally. The condition under the tongue is called \"thick tongue,\" if it is found in the cheeks and hard palate, it is called \"thick palate,\" and if it is found on the gums, it is called \"thick gums.\" All of these should have their blood fluid punctured.

Ge Shi advised using hair wrapped around the finger to dip in well water and wipe the mouth; at night, burning yellow minerals to extract heat and applying it to the tongue. If the infant has a \"fused tongue\" with membrane underneath, similar to the partitions in a pomegranate, it may cause difficulty in speaking later on. One can cut it carefully, which may produce a little blood but is not harmful; if the bleeding does not stop, one can burn the hair to ash and apply it to stop the bleeding. Use the Baoming powder: one qian of dried white alum, half a qian of horse's tooth nitre, and one fen of vermilion, finely ground together. Take white goose droppings, mix it with water to extract juice, and apply it inside the mouth and on the cheeks. First, use the hair to clean off any filth on the tongue, then apply the medicine. The occurrence of mouth sores is due to the infant having an abundance of blood energy and being overly nourished, causing heat accumulation in the heart, which steams upward, resulting in mouth sores. One should use powdered southern star herb mixed with light vinegar and apply it to the soles of the feet; wet-nurses should take the Xixin powder while also taking the Xiexin Decoction. For treating the mouth, use powdered huanglian mixed with honey water to apply inside. Huangbo, qingdai, and ice shavings are all effective. Additionally, using a small amount of niuhuang powdered and bamboo juice applied inside the mouth can treat candidiasis. Applying horse's tooth nitre in a bean-sized amount is also good.

If it affects the inner cheeks and upper palate, it is called a heavy palate; if it affects the gums, it is called heavy gums. In all cases, one should eliminate the blood by needling and apply true cattail pollen; alternative treatments include applying ash, horse’s tooth nitrate, borax, or alchemical nitrate; or using bamboo juice mixed with berberine for application, which is also effective. Additionally, the condition referred to as a \"wooden tongue\" occurs when the tongue indicates the state of the heart and the meridians of the spleen are obstructed.

If the tongue swells and fills the mouth, applying just borneol is also effective. Furthermore, if there is tongue movement, it indicates slight heat in the spleen, causing the tongue veins to tighten. One should relax the tongue regularly. When treating this, do not use cold medicines; instead, gradually administer yellow powder. If water consumption is suspected to be heat-related, do not use cold medicines, as this is misleading.

Then take warm water, dip a fine cloth, wrap your finger, and gently press it down; after pressing, apply the medicine. **Wooden Tongue** Zeng says: A wooden tongue is swollen and hard, hindering milk and food intake, indicating excessive wind-heat. Remedies such as Dang Gui San, Xie Huang San, and Yu Lu Yin can be taken; then apply Xie Huang San to rub on the tongue. The tongue is the organ of the heart; if the heart is heated, it will cause ulcers and cracks; if the liver is congested, blood will surge out; if the spleen is obstructed, it will be like snow from the fetus; if hot, it will swell; if windy, it will be strong and wooden, making the mouth close and difficult to open, limbs will feel strong heat, and there will be wheezing and speech difficulties—these are the signs. The treatment method involves cooling and resolving the upper jiao and the evil heat in the heart, liver, and spleen meridians, dispersing wind and transforming phlegm.

If in the chest and diaphragm there accumulates heat and toxins, leading to the generation of wind-phlegm, which becomes stagnant and unresolved, it manifests as diseases of the throat—ulcers may form inside the throat, or appear as decayed flesh, resulting in swelling and pain, creating an obstruction that hinders swallowing, and in severe cases, a heavy tongue may develop. In treatment, it is essential to first eliminate wind-phlegm to clear the throat and diaphragm, and then resolve the heat and toxins; if treatment is delayed, serious consequences may ensue. Moreover, if heat toxins invade the soft palate causing ulcers, it is known as hanging sore or intestinal cold, which can also lead to throat closure and difficulty in swallowing. When faced with illness, treat it diligently! The diseases of the throat mainly stem from the attack of heat toxins. Throughout the seasons, these can harm the heart and viscera, and daily exposures can attack the throat, this is referred to as kidney cold injury. Symptoms include single or double flesh worms, heavy tongue, wooden tongue, mumps, and hanging swellings; severe cases may cause swelling of the head and face from the upward attack. The general principle is first to cleanse the white coating on the tongue, then to dispel wind saliva. For single or double flesh worms, if they are suitable for needling, then needle them; if they are unsuitable, use fumigating powders to retreat them, afterwards apply internal medications. For wooden tongue, aside from taking medicines, continue using medicinal powders.

Apply a little flying salt mixed with a small amount of borneol to treat it, and it may heal by itself with saliva. If phlegm and qi are trapped on the tongue, forming painful and hard lumps, use a fine needle to pierce and let it bleed. Then apply Ice Borax Powder and take Huang Lian Heart-Resolving Decoction. ### Running Horse Sore The term \"Running Horse Sore\" indicates a rapid onset that cannot be delayed. It often arises from residual toxins of measles and smallpox, as well as from excessive heat of various diseases. The symptoms include rotten gums, black decay that emits a foul smell, and, in severe cases, loss of gums with roots turning black and decaying. Within a few days, this can lead to perforated cheeks and split lips, making it truly difficult to cure. At the onset, it is advisable to use Aloe Vera Decoction to dispel the sore, and externally apply Ren Zhong Bai Powder or Ice Borax Powder to remove black necrotic tissue, revealing red flesh and flowing blood, which is a good sign.

When they interact with the blood and qi, they cause sores and ulcers. If they appear on the lips as sores that intermittently heal and then reappear, it is called \"tight lips\" or \"heavy lips.\" If they occur frequently, the lips become swollen and thick, sometimes even with lingering sores, leading to lip deformity. If they arise inside the lips, forming sores that connect to both cheeks, it is referred to as \"oral sores.\" If they occur at the corners of the mouth, they are called \"swallow's mouth.\" It is commonly said that this is due to dairy and food observing swallows, which causes swallow's mouth sores. **Discussion on Tongue Manipulation** When young children manipulate their tongues, there are two indications: one is heart heat. The heart is connected to the root of the tongue; when it is hot, the root becomes dry and tense, prompting the child to frequently stick out their tongue in a relaxed manner. The second is spleen heat. The spleen is connected to the tongue; when it is hot, the tongue also becomes dry and tense, leading to the same behavior. Both cases cause a desire for water. Heart heat results in thirst, while spleen heat causes depletion of fluids, which both provoke drinking. These two conditions are similar and should be examined carefully. A child with heart heat has a red face, experiences heat in the mouth while sleeping, is often restless, prefers coolness, and may grind their teeth. Treatment should focus on reducing heat. A child with spleen heat has hard, yellow stools, a yellowish face, and slight bodily jaundice; treatment should involve gentle guiding, avoiding cold medicines and excessive purging. If forcefully purged, it can lead to spleen and stomach deficiency, fluid depletion, and aggravate the child's restlessness and emaciation, ultimately resulting in malnutrition.

The method of obtaining the urine involves placing a tortoise on blue lotus leaves and using a mirror to reflect it, causing the urine to flow out. [Note: A child's vital energy is not fully developed, and their skin pores are not tightly sealed, allowing wind evil to penetrate. Alternatively, phlegm and heat can accumulate in the lungs, hence the attack of wind and heat leading to these symptoms; or the child may have been exposed to wind too early, resulting in the invasion into the marrow. Treatment should primarily focus on nourishing the spleen and lungs. If the condition arises due to the mother’s consumption of rich and spicy foods, her treatment should also be addressed.

Children who walk late may have deficient liver and kidney, and those who are unable to walk as they grow may also have this condition; some may exhibit weakness in their liver qi and experience cramps in their hands and feet. If the liver and kidneys are both weak, they cannot extend their legs. The remedy is to use the Rehmannia Six Formula for nourishment. The condition of \"turtle chest\" refers to a swollen, elevated chest that resembles a turtle, indicating lung heat. This can be treated with a modified Gengzhi Pill. In the case of children with turtle chest due to lung heat, administering this modified formula can bring about miraculous results. The condition of \"turtle back\" presents as a hunched posture resembling a turtle shell, which is caused by external wind affecting the spine and entering the marrow. This often leads to a chronic ailment. Moxibustion should be applied to the two points next to the third vertebra and the two points next to the second vertebra, one and a half cun away from the spine. While this method works, it may not always yield results. The Zhiqiao Pill should be used. Turtle back is a severe condition marked by kidney wind entering the marrow. Internal consumption of the Zhiqiao Pill and moxibustion should be done consecutively. What is meant by walking late? Bones are nourished by marrow, and if blood and qi do not sufficiently fill the marrow, the bones become weak and soft, leading to an inability to walk. This arises from both kidney and liver deficiency. Since the liver governs the tendons, weakness in the tendons prevents early walking; the kidney governs the bones, and weak bones cannot be strong. The remedy is to use the modified Rehmannia Six Formula.

If it is due to the nursing mother consuming rich and thick foods, the mother should take a stomach-clearing powder, and the child should also take a small amount. **Crane Knee Wind** \"Crane Knee Wind\" refers to legs that are thin, with knees that are thicker, resembling a crane's knee, hence the name. This condition arises from insufficient kidney energy, allowing external pathogens to invade. Initially, there is pain inside the knee, with no change in external color, and difficulty in bending or stretching. If within one or two months it swells, turns red, and produces pus, it can be treated; if it is hard, white, and does not produce pus, it is difficult to treat.

It is advised to avoid breaking up the qi and dispersing it, as this may weaken the lungs; instead, one should avoid retention and seek to descend qi and eliminate phlegm. **Standard for Diagnosis and Treatment** [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang] **Turtle Chest** According to Zhang, if a wet nurse feeds an infant, it is common to squeeze out any stagnant milk; in summer, it is important to wash the milk clean and squeeze out the hot milk. Allowing the infant to drink hot milk can damage lung qi, leading to a swelling and fullness in the chest, which can make the chest rise high like a turtle, hence the name Turtle Chest. According to Zeng, this condition arises from wind and phlegm accumulating in the heart and chest, and subsequently, from exposure to wind and heat. The lungs, being the canopy of all organs, reside above the diaphragm. If water and qi overflow, the lungs become distended and, over time, solidify into phlegm, stagnating in the heart and chest. When compounded by internal wind and heat, external symptoms manifest as red lips and a flushed face, accompanied by cough and shortness of breath, causing the sternum to rise as if covered by a palm, termed Turtle Chest. The method of treatment is to relax the lungs, transform phlegm, and benefit the diaphragm to eliminate phlegm from the lung meridian. Initially, one should use the Wuling Powder mixed with a soothing qi decoction, combined with ginger juice and scallion broth for administration; next, utilize Qingfei Decoction, Xionghuang Powder, Biyu Pills, and Ruyi Ointment for treatment. If the initial medicine cures the condition but it recurs, if the transformation directs phlegm and saliva upwards, combined with seizures, it becomes difficult to treat. **Turtle Back** If the child sits up too early and windy conditions affect the spine, the wind can reach the marrow, causing the back to elevate like a turtle.

The use of deer antler has proven effective. Tang stated that for children who cannot walk, the treatment should utilize Qian's Kidney Tonic with Rehmannia pills, adding deer antler, bark of Wu Jia, and musk. My nephew Huang Zhiluo's son could not walk at three years old; after taking this recipe, it yielded results. **Medicine for Beginners** (Ming Era, Li Zhan) **Hands and Feet** Weak hands cannot move effectively. This results from weak liver, causing the tendons in both hands to retract without being able to extend. The treatment is Yi Yi Wan. Weak and slow-moving feet signify insufficient bone marrow, inadequate qi and blood, and weak tendons that cannot support the bones. The remedy should be Kidney Qi Pills combined with Niu Xi, Wu Jia Pei, and deer antler. For those who cannot walk at five or six years old, sheep horn pills are recommended; for those unable to walk by three years old, use one tael of Wu Jia Pei, five qian each of Niu Xi and Mu Guo, ground into powder, and taken with a small amount of rice drink mixed with a bit of alcohol.

Then, there was digestive stagnation with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but there was no tenderness upon palpation; this indicated injury to the spleen and stomach. I used the Liu Jun Zi Decoction added with Mu Xiang and Rou Dou Kou to treat it. Although the vomiting had not ceased, the left and right radial pulses were assessed lightly and were full. When palpated, they felt empty. The classics say: the kidneys open to the two yin. I used the Schisandra fruit powder for four doses, and the bowel movements suddenly ceased; afterwards, there was further food injury leading to sour regurgitation and diarrhea with heavy bowel movements. In the morning, I took the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and in the evening, the Liu Jun Zi Decoction with Mu Xiang and Gan Jiang, and I was cured. An elderly man had a son whose limbs were weak and sensitive to wind and cold and felt pleasure in sunlight. I asked the wet nurse to take the modified Ba Wei Wan three times daily and one dose of the Shi Quan Da Bu Decoction, also giving it to the child. Over the course of a year, the limbs gradually became stronger, and by the age of two, he could walk. A five-year-old boy had weak legs and was unable to walk, and he lost his innocence early on. By the age of seventeen, after marriage, he still had weak legs, and he felt his head was growing larger. Pleased with his caution, he resided in a Daoist temple. Consequently, in the morning, I prescribed him the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction and in the evening, the Di Huang Wan with added Schisandra fruit and deer antler, and after a year, he became healthy."},{"anchor":"trans-97p","marker":"97p","type":"translation","text":"A nine-year-old boy suffered from leg pain. Using the scallion poultice and the major wind-cold decoction, the swelling turned red. He was given the immortal life-prolonging drink and the tonifying middle and benefiting qi decoction alternately, and the swelling gradually reduced. He was also given the angelica and sclerotia decoction, combined with the tonifying middle and benefiting qi decoction; after two to three days and one poultice with scallion, it disappeared after over two months. Another child had a serious ulcer that wouldn't heal. He was weak, ate little, felt dry and hot, especially in the afternoon. This was a severe deficiency of spleen qi. Five doses of the tonifying middle and benefiting qi decoction were given to replenish the original qi, followed by one dose of the major wind-cold decoction to treat the ulcer. After a month, all symptoms subsided. He was then given the complete tonifying decoction for a month, accompanied by the major wind-cold decoction to help resolve it. A third child had a non-healing ulcer, with intermittent chills and fever, and dark, painful urination, indicating a deficiency of blood and qi. The complete tonifying decoction was given, adding ophiopogon and five-flavor herbs, leading to a quick recovery. He was advised to stop the cinnamon and continue with blood-tonifying pain-relief pills until healed. A girl had pain in her left leg and took remedies for qi flow. Her left knee was swollen and hard, and she was coughing up phlegm. I diagnosed it as \"crane knee wind.\" Her pulse was wiry and rapid yet weak, indicating issues in the liver, spleen, and kidney meridians. As both the substantial body and the harmful qi were deficient, the primary focus should be on tonifying the spleen and stomach. Not believing this, she continued to attack the pathogenic qi, causing a flare-up of symptoms. I first used a modified five-flavor decoction with added schizonepeta, dried ginger, and cinnamon to strengthen her spleen qi, followed by different techniques, including the eight-treasure decoction, which led to discharge; then an alternating regimen of the major wind-cold decoction and earth yellow pill helped her recover."},{"anchor":"trans-98p","marker":"98p","type":"translation","text":"A young child experiences swelling in both knees. After applying various disinfectant medications, the feet and ankles become red and swollen. This is due to the child's inherited deficiency in kidney qi; therefore, using a formula like the Eight Treasures Decoction with Rehmannia will help reduce the swelling. If techniques to dispel pathogenic qi or other such medications are used, it will certainly lead to a failure in recovery. According to the \"Essential Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment,\" if a child has a foot injury causing pain without change in flesh color, the injury involves the bone. Frequent application of fried scallions compresses the area, and during the early morning hours, they can take a blood-regulating pain relief pill. During the day, herbal formulas to strengthen the spleen and invigorate qi and blood should be administered. After several months, taking Rehmannia pills for over three months leads to recovery. In another case, a child dislocates the arm bone, resulting in swelling, pain, and fever. Using medications to dispel pathogenic qi is quite effective, but appetite decreases. I applied scallions to relieve the pain, which stopped immediately. Using the Six Gentlemen Decoction, astragalus, bupleurum, platycodon, dicentra, and fracture herbs helped improve appetite and reduce swelling. Furthermore, using the Supplementing the Middle and Benefiting Qi formula with Schisandra and the Five Flavors allowed the qi and blood to harmonize, leading to the resolution of heat and recovery. A child experiences a sprain, with swelling around the ankle and weakness in form and energy. I intend to focus on treating them primarily by tonifying qi and blood while assisting with herbal formulas for dispersion. However, they opted for oral intake of dispersing medications and external application of cold herbs, as if they were suffering from alternating fever and chill. I noted that the symptoms of severe chills and fever, along with a strong pulse, indicated extreme qi and blood deficiency; thus, treatment yielded no results. Eventually, internal decay drained all qi and blood, leading to the child's demise."},{"anchor":"orig-1p","marker":"1p","type":"original","text":"古今图书集成医部全录卷四百十五 小儿唇口齿舌喉病门 千金方 【唐 孙思邈】 鹅口

风毒湿热，随其虚处所著，搏于血气，则坐疮疡。若发于唇上生疮，乍瘥乍发，谓之紧唇，又曰沉唇。其发频者，唇常肿大粗厚，或上有疮不效，甚者以至唇腆。若发于唇里，连两颊生疮者，名曰口疮。若发于口吻两角生疮者，名曰燕口。俗云因乳食看视燕子，则生燕口疮也。 弄舌论 小儿弄舌者，其证有二：一者心热。心系舌本，热则舌本干濇而紧，故时时吐弄舒缓之。二者脾热。脾络连舌，热则舌亦干濇而紧，故时时吐弄舒缓之。皆欲饮水。心热则发渴，脾热则津液耗，皆引饮。二证相似，宜加审别。心热者面赤，睡即口中气热，时时烦躁，喜就其冷，咬牙上窜，治宜退热。脾热者大便稠硬，赤黄色，面黄身亦微黄，治宜微导之，不可用冷药，又不可转下；若悞下之，则脾胃虚，津液耗，又加五心烦热，面黄肌瘦，变为疳也。若大病未已，用药后弄舌者，大凶也。以人参知母散、泻黄散治之。"},{"anchor":"orig-26p","marker":"26p","type":"original","text":"舌病论

小儿咽喉生病者，由风毒湿热搏于气血，随其经络虚处所著，则生其病。若发于咽喉者，或为喉痹，或为缠喉风，或为乳鹅；重者或为马喉痹，又或悬痈肿，或腮颔肿，或喉中生疮。 诸物梗喉论"},{"anchor":"orig-27p","marker":"27p","type":"original","text":"小儿有悞吞诸物在喉中，不能下，不能出，妨碍饮食，气出不快；甚者塞刺疼痛，霎时不佳，便致危殆。 方
