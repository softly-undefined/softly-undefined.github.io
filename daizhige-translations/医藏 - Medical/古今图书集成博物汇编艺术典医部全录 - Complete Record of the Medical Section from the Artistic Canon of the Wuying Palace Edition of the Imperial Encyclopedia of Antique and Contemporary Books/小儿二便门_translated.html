<p><strong>Children&#39;s Issues with Urination and Bowel Movements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Confucian Teaching on Filial Piety</strong>  【Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng】</p>
<p><strong>Obstruction of Urination and Bowel Movements</strong></p>
<p>In cases where children experience difficulties with urination and bowel movements, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions the Sanjiao (Triple Warmer) as a point of obstruction. &quot;Obstruction&quot; indicates that movement is hindered. One may use Longliushui (long-running water) to decoct the Bajing San (Eight Corrective Powder) and administer it at intervals until normal urination and defecation resume. If this condition does not arise from heat caused by medicinal treatment, it is easy to remedy; however, if it is due to excessive consumption of heating medicines leading to severe dryness, it becomes not only difficult to treat but may tragically result in death. One may also utilize honey water to mix with Yiyuan San (Enhancement of Vitality Powder) and then administer Tongge Wan (Open Barrier Pill).</p>
<p><strong>Dysuria</strong></p>
<p>For children suffering from sand and stone dysuria as well as five types of painful urination, accompanied by abdominal pain in the navel area, the Yiyuan San serves as the main remedy when mixed with Longliushui for administration. The Bajing San and Shihui San (Stone Rush Powder) may be consumed according to recipe guidelines. All three medicines can be adjusted in dosage. The reason is due to heat in the bladder, which dries up the fluids; hence, the common term &quot;cold dysuria&quot; pertains to universal ailments. The Wuling San (Five Dysuria Powder) can be modified by reducing cinnamon and adding Yiyuan San, thus creating the Dan Shen San (Mild Drainage Powder). </p>
<p><strong>Questions from Infants</strong>  【Ming Dynasty, Lu Bosi】<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>Inability to Defecate and Urinate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> When treating infants with a febrile condition, if the body is hot and the mind is clouded, leading to a lack of appetite, accompanied by chills, fever, and constipation, with anxiety and excessive sweating, indicating stagnation, fullness, and urgency in the abdomen, and a thin yellow body, enduring high fever day and night, as well as for conditions like wind, heatstroke, convulsions, and kidney disorders, a remedy such as Detoxicating Powder should be administered. One may also take a decoction of Forsythia with Radish and Angelica to treat pediatric convulsions related to accumulated heat and constipation, yielding quick results. Additionally, one can employ the navel-covering method: use a whole green onion without washing off the dirt, a slice of ginger, twenty-one fermented soybeans, and two teaspoons of salt, crush them together, form into a hot cake, and place it over the navel, secured with cotton. After a while, this should help facilitate passage; if not, a different remedy should be used. Inability to urinate can also be addressed this way.</p>
<p><strong>Inability to Defecate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> When a child is constipated, it signifies internal heat in the lungs flowing into the large intestine, causing obstruction. This is due to actual heat and should be treated with a cooling drink, adding Bupleurum if necessary. For significant heat, adding Gardenia and Scutellaria will help relieve it. If there is heat both internally and externally, characterized by a yellowish face, red cheeks, dry lips, and dry mouth, with red and scanty urination and dark yellow feces, with no sweating, one should first release the exterior using Bupleurum to induce sweating. After this, if constipation or abdominal pain persists, one may use cooling drinks, Major Bupleurum Decoction, or Chengqi Decoction to address it. For accumulated heat, Shenqi Pill is particularly effective.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Difficulty in Urination</strong></p>
<p>Tang stated: In the case of children with difficulty in urination, it is due to an imbalance in the heart&#39;s meridian, either from hidden heat or from fright. The heart fire rises, which cannot be subdued, causing the kidney water to fail to rise. This leads to an increase in heart heat, and since the small intestine is associated with the heart, difficulty in urination occurs. Mú Tōng Decoction is the primary remedy, with more severe cases treated by the Ba Zheng San. Additionally, for cases with abdominal distension, irritability, and heat, the Zhi Zi Ren San is indicated. For accumulated heat, Shen Qiong Wan is effective.</p>
<p><strong>Enuresis</strong></p>
<p>Chao noted: Enuresis occurs because of cold in the bladder, which cannot control the release of urine. The kidneys govern water, and kidney energy descends to the yin. Urination is merely the excess of water. The bladder serves as the reservoir for fluids; when cold energy weakens, it cannot contain water, leading to enuresis. Yang mentioned: Bedwetting in children is due to cold in the bladder; during the night, which belongs to yin, urination cannot be controlled, and it occurs unconsciously during sleep, and thus the Po Gu Zhi San should be used for treatment. Additionally, a tonic for enhancing intellect should not be omitted.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Cloudy Urine</strong></p>
<p>Tang’s commentary states: When a child&#39;s urine is cloudy, it is due to irregular breastfeeding, which damages the spleen, preventing the clear and turbid from being distinguished, resulting in urine that resembles rice wash. If this persists, it could lead to consumption. Additionally, there may be hidden heat in the heart and spleen, and it is advisable to clear the spleen, eliminate food stagnation, and relieve the small intestines. Fuling Powder is indicated for this. Sanling Powder and Digestive Pills can also be used. Drinking the Clear Beverage is also acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Blood in Stool and Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>It is said: If a child has blood in their urine or stool within seven days after birth, this is due to excess heat from the fetal energy. If the mother consumes hot food, alcohol, or roasted items, the heat and toxins enter the heart and lungs, affecting the child in utero and also transferring to the heart and lungs. If the heat enters the heart of the girl, she may have blood in her urine; if it enters the lungs of the boy, it may appear in the stool. If the blood is light and watery, it resembles amniotic fluid, and if severe, the blood may appear bright red. In such cases, do not use other medicines; instead, take the root of fresh Rehmannia, extract its juice, mix it with a little honey, and administer it warm. This will bring relief over time; it is effective for boys. Guo Lu Beverage is also suitable to take alongside. A strong decoction of reed root and flowers can also be effective. Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction is also acceptable. Zang Du Ju Jin Wan can be used for effectiveness. Di Huang Wan is also applicable. In cases of blood stasis, use Tao Ren Cheng Qi Decoction to eliminate it.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Prolapse of the Rectum and Hemorrhoids</strong></p>
<p>The Tang family method for treating rectal prolapse involves using a scallion broth for steaming and washing to soften the area, then gently reinserting it. This condition is typically due to excessive diarrhea, so it is appropriate to take medicine for diarrhea afterward, followed by using medicinal herbs such as sophora flower. There are also remedies using a decoction of gallnut, combined with nitre for steaming and contraction; another method involves finely grinding true cattail pollen, mixing it with pig bile to apply to the anus. &quot;Complete Infant Formulas&quot; recommends using the Tuxiang powder. For cases with swollen and painful hemorrhoids, a mixture of yellow lead and talc in equal parts, diluted with well water and applied, will resolve the issue. Additionally, half a cash of white lead powder mixed with half a character of dried brains, applied with good wine, is very effective for swelling. Huanglian Jiedu Decoction can also be taken. Washing with bitter Sophora is effective as well. There are also remedies using Mithridate, alum, and powdered dried brains applied topically, followed by washing with herbs like schizonepeta and saposhnikovia. Using fresh root of cucumber also proves effective.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>Five Types of Dysuria</strong></p>
<p>Nest&#39;s words: The dysuria in children is due to heat in the kidneys and bladder. The bladder and kidneys are interrelated, both governing water. Water enters the small intestine, descends to the bladder, and through the lower pathways results in urination. When there is heat in the bladder, fluids dry up internally, obstructing the water pathways, leading to accumulation in the bladder. When the kidney qi is hot, it becomes thick, thus causing the water pathways to be obstructed, resulting in dripping urination, hence it is called dysuria. The condition presents with small amounts of urine that are frequent, along with urgent pain in the lower abdomen that radiates to the navel.</p>
<p>There are also stone dysuria, qi dysuria, heat dysuria, blood dysuria, and cold dysuria, each with its specific explanations. </p>
<p>The stone dysuria is characterized by the passage of sand and stones. When the kidneys are affected by heat, they can transform it into stones; thus, pain occurs in the urethra, making it difficult to urinate, with intermittent sharp pains. The bladder feels urgent, and sand and stones are expelled during urination.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>The condition of painful urination due to clear urine occurs when the kidneys and bladder receive the heat qi from the lungs, causing swelling. The qi is overwhelmed by heat, hence it flows into the bladder, resulting in a stagnation of qi, a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, leading to painful urination.</p>
<p>The condition of painful urination due to heat arises when there is heat qi in the three burners, received in the kidneys and bladder; thus, the heat qi flows into the bladder and causes painful urination.</p>
<p>The condition of painful urination with blood is due to excessive heat; in severe cases, it results in blood in the urine, referred to as blood-tinged painful urination. The heart governs blood, and when the heat is severe, the blood disperses and loses its normal channels, seeping into the bladder and resulting in painful urination with blood.</p>
<p>In cases of painful urination due to cold, the symptoms begin with chills and shivering, followed by urination. Children may experience excessive cold exposure, affecting the lower burner; the cold qi enters the bladder, where the righteous qi contends with the cold qi. If the cold qi overcomes the righteous qi, shivering occurs, and when the cold resolves, urination can occur.</p>
<p>To treat painful urination, Jinsha San is effective. Other formulas like Wuling San and Mutong San can be modified for treatment, leading to a potential cure. Daohong San is also effective. Using it alongside medications for major meridian pulses could also be beneficial, right?<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Ming Medical Miscellany</strong><br><strong>By Wang Lun</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the urine and stool of children, it is important to examine the urine, which may resemble rice washing. If it appears clear for a moment and then turns murky, this indicates damp-heat in the spleen and stomach. If the stool is oily and white, resembles fish gelatin, has red streaks, or is yellowish-black, this signifies accumulated damp-heat; one should treat the spleen to resolve stagnation, clear the middle burner, eliminate damp-heat, and regulate diet. If there is a sudden change to a bluish color, this indicates a transformation and does not require medication. If it does not improve after a long time, it is advisable to use tonifying spleen and liver-regulating medicine, but do not use it excessively.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the urine resembles washing water, or if the stool is milky white, it is advisable to use Fei Er Wan. For accumulated damp-heat with yellow and black coloring, employ Si Jun Zi Tang with Huang Lian and Mu Xiang. If the color has been blue for a long time without recovery, or accompanied by diarrhea or abdominal pain, one should use Liu Jun Zi Tang, adding Mu Xiang and Shao Yao. If the complexion is yellow, with difficult urination, yellowing skin peeling, sores under the nose, craving for soil, reduced appetite, and bluish-brown stools, the remedy should be Zhi Zi Fu Ling Tang.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Enuresis</strong></p>
<p>In cases of enuresis in young children, this occurs due to cold in the bladder, which cannot control urination, hence the wetting. Additionally, if urination occurs, it is also because of cold in the bladder; during the night, associated with Yin, the small bladder cannot be restrained, leading to involuntary urination. Use powder made from broken old paper, Yi Zhi Ren powder, and chicken intestine powder.</p>
<p><strong>Enuresis</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys govern water, and they correspond with the foot Taiyang. The classics state: The bladder is the official in charge of the state, storing fluids. When lying down, the Yang Qi is retracted; the energies of the kidneys and bladder are deficient and cold, unable to restrain, thus urination occurs unconsciously during sleep. The &quot;Inner Classic&quot; states that the inability of the bladder to restrain leads to enuresis. Treatment includes the same powders as mentioned: broken old paper, Yi Zhi powder, and chicken intestine powder. There may also be a heat pathogen in the kidneys, troubling the foot Jueyin meridian, causing blood and Qi to become stagnant, leading to weakness and dysfunction. Hence fluids seep into the bladder, resulting in involuntary urination; for this, use the Liu Wei Di Huang Wan. For deficient heat, the same pill can be used. If there is deficiency of Spleen and Lung Qi, use the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, adding Bu Gu Zhi and Shan Zhu Yu.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>Inability to Pass Urine and Stool</strong></p>
<p>Hanlin Waiting Scholar Yang Daye asked: What is the reason for a child’s inability to pass urine and stool? The answer is: Overindulgence in milk and food disrupts the four bodily humors, and due to a craving for tastes, the internal organs become ill. Sweet and rich food causes dampness and stagnation, leading to blockages in the intestines and stomach. Wind obstructs and burdens the heart and lungs, causing the flow of qi to be unregulated, and water and food cannot move freely without obstructing upward. Thus, they are bound in the lower body. The child, unaware of pain, may not articulate the reasons; they cry out in distress repeatedly, getting angry and swollen but refusing milk. They don&#39;t realize the sharp pain that reaches the navel, resulting in a pale or greenish complexion. One should then examine the pulse and breath to treat. If the source of illness is not identified and treatment relies solely on external symptoms using medicine, how can one expect effective results?</p>
<p><strong>Inability to Pass Stool</strong></p>
<p>This is due to the wet nurse or rich foods causing heat accumulation and the six excesses and seven emotions, with afflictive fire being transmitted to the child. One should use remedies to clear the evil and resolve the pent-up condition. If the child is constitutionally weak or has developed desires prematurely, leading to difficult bowel movements with associated pain during urination, one should use tonics for the lungs and kidneys. The &quot;Collected Writings of the Zhu Family&quot; states: A man with insufficient essence who engages with a woman to release his essence may have unresolved deficiencies in his body, leading to difficult ailments later. When an old man, whose essence is already depleted yet desires intimacy, tries to release his essence, it does not come forth and he internally deteriorates. If essence is exhausted and further depleted, he may experience pain during urination and defecation. Currently, young boys may suffer from this ailment, further illustrating the differences between modern individuals and those of ancient times. As human vitality and blood thickness vary greatly, how can physicians adhere rigidly to ancient prescriptions without adjusting for change?<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Difficulty in Urination</strong></p>
<p>When an infant experiences difficulty in urination, there are two patterns: Yin obstruction and Yang obstruction. Yin obstruction is due to cold and dampness infiltrating the body, causing blockage, known as Yin closure. For this, a decoction of white peony root can be used along with southern wood fragrance; additionally, roasted salt wrapped in cloth can be heated and applied around the navel. Also, combining five-ingredient powder with fine sand and taking it in salt water on an empty stomach can yield rapid results.</p>
<p>Yang obstruction occurs due to extreme heat, leading to dryness and blockage, known as Yang closure. There are also distinctions between retention and dysuria. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states that difficulty in the bladder leads to retention, which is due to weak internal organ energy being obstructed by heat, preventing proper flow; it is neither a painful condition nor one associated with excessive volume, but rather a simple blockage without the ability to pass urine. Symptoms include abdominal distension and tightness; for treatment, one can use five-ingredient powder plus plantain and lungwort, or herbal mixtures like Muxiang powder, Jade Dew drink, or Yiyuan powder. Alternatively, placing a ginger and fermented bean cake on the navel can also be effective, regardless of whether it is Yin or Yang obstruction, and Wan&#39;an drink is especially beneficial.</p>
<p>Dongyuan states that issues with urination differ between Qi and Blood. The bladder, governed by the foot Taiyang, is essential for urination; it grows in the time of Shen, aligning with metal, which generates water. If there is heat trapped in the lungs, water cannot be produced, leading to a cessation of the source of urination.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The treatment method employs the proper cooling and drying herbs that can disperse thin qi, such as Poria, Polyporus, ZeXie, Amber, Dongxin, Tongcao, Cheqian, Qumai, and Bianxu, which are all mild and diuretic, capable of draining heat from the lungs while promoting the transformation of water. If there is no thirst, and the heat resides in the lower energizer, it indicates that heat is obstructing the flow, causing difficulty in urination. In this case, it is essential to use herbs that are rich and heavy in nature to treat it. </p>
<p>There are two types of afflictions: one is located in the upper energizer, affecting the qi system, and is characterized by thirst; the other is situated in the lower energizer, affecting the blood system, and is not associated with thirst. The presence of dampness in the blood explains the lack of thirst. The distinction between these two conditions is quite easy to identify. </p>
<p>In cases where body fluids are disproportionately drained into the intestines and stomach, leading to diarrhea and scanty urination, it is advisable to promote drainage. Whereas, if heat is trapped in the lower energizer, with dry body fluids and inhibited urination, it is best to encourage dispersion and drainage.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>If the spleen and stomach are weak and unable to regulate the water pathways, it is advisable to soothe the qi. If the wet nurse&#39;s liver and heart channels have heat, use Gardenia Clear Liver Powder; if the liver&#39;s anger and fire manifest, use Chaihu and Gardenia Powder. If the condition is due to the parents previously taking drying agents, use Four Substance Decoction, Wheat Gem, and Licorice. If there is yellowing, use Four Substance Decoction with added Cornelian Cherry, Hortonia, Anemarrhena, Schisandra, and Wheat Gem. For lung deficiency with insufficiency, use Middle Tonifying Qi Decoction with added Chinese Yam and Wheat Gem. If there is a condition of weakness and frequent urination, use Rehmannia Pills. For heat obstructing the bladder and causing difficulty, use Five Lin Powder. If the spleen and lungs are dry and unable to transform, use Huangqin Clear Lung Decoction. For bladder yin deficiency, where yang cannot support and causes dripping, use Kidney Nourishing Pills. If there is bladder yang deficiency where yin cannot transform and causes dripping, use Six Flavor Pills. If the wet nurse&#39;s heavy diet and alcohol have caused excess heat, use Clear Stomach Powder and Five Lin Powder, while also considering additional treatments for the urinary symptoms.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>Enuresis</p>
<p>The &quot;Original Disease Formula&quot; states that enuresis is caused by cold. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions that incontinence is referred to as &quot;unrestrained urination.&quot; Ren Zhai observes that urination is a residue of bodily fluids. The kidneys govern water while the bladder is the organ for these fluids. When both the kidneys and bladder are deficient and cold pathogens take over, they cannot restrain water, resulting in involuntary urination, known as enuresis. If it occurs during sleep, it is called bedwetting. These conditions arise from both the kidneys and bladder lacking strength and being affected by cold, and they can be treated with Ji Chang San. </p>
<p>Zeng Shi states that the transmission between the heart and kidneys is out of balance, while the small intestine and bladder cannot properly regulate. Those who wet the bed while dreaming are also experiencing deficiencies and cold in the lower regions. Due to insufficient vital Yang energy, the &quot;Three Causes Formula&quot; along with Jiu Zi Wan is used for treatment, as are Shen Ling Bai Zhu San and Bu Shen Di Huang Wan. However, it is necessary to strengthen the earth to preserve the water, thus preventing leakage. The principle is that boosting the kidneys is not as effective as boosting the spleen. Ping Wei San can be doubled with added Yi Zhi Ren, ground finely, and decocted with ginger, dates, and salt, taken warm on an empty stomach.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>White Urine and Turbid Stools</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Complete Infant Formula&quot; states: When urine initially appears slightly red and then for a long time remains white and turbid, it signifies the presence of heat dysentery. If it starts yellowish white and remains turbid for a long time, it indicates cold dysentery. For cold conditions, use Yihuang Powder as the primary remedy; for heat conditions, use Niuhuang Pill; for both cold and heat, use Aloe Pill; for purely downward draining white turbidity, use Houpu Pill; and for those with loss of body fluids leading to dysentery producing white urine, use Fuling Powder.</p>
<p>If the urine resembles rice water or turns white after a long time, it may also indicate spleen deficiency with food accumulation and damp heat descending. First, administer Fuling Powder for five to seven doses, followed by Siwei Feier Pill. If there is a lack of appetite for milk, or abdominal distension, with frequent urination and defecation, this reflects a sinking of spleen qi. In the morning, use Wuwu Yigong Powder, and in the evening, use Siwei Feier Pill. If the body is overweight, the complexion is yellow, urine is irregular, jaundice occurs, sores appear under the nose, there is a craving for soil and a reduced appetite, with stools appearing dark brown, use Gardenia and Fuling Decoction, and attentively examine the dietary habits and emotional state of the nursing mother.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Lymphatic Disorders</strong></p>
<p>All lymphatic disorders arise from kidney deficiency. The kidneys and bladder are interrelated; when water flows into the small intestine, it communicates with the bladder and produces urine from the lower part of the body. Kidney qi connects with the lower, and this is the pathway for fluids. There are five types of lymphatic disorders: Khao, Cold, Heat, Blood, and Stone, each to be described later.</p>
<p><strong>Khao Lymph</strong>: When urination contains a fatty substance resembling grease, floating in the urine, it indicates kidney deficiency that fails to regulate the fat and allow it to flow downward.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Lymph</strong>: It starts with chills followed by urination; this is also due to kidney deficiency causing the lower jiao to be cold. Cold qi enters the bladder, contending with righteous qi, hence the urine becomes thick and there are chills.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Lymph</strong>: This occurs when there is heat in the lower jiao; the heat qi transmits to the kidneys, flowing into the bladder. Consequently, the urine is frequently yellow and thick, sometimes accompanied by fresh blood.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Lymph</strong>: This is an extreme form of heat. The heart governs the blood and channels externally while operating on organs internally. When heat is intense, it disrupts its normal pathway. The heart and small intestine are interrelated, thus it flows down into the bladder, resulting in blood lymph.</p>
<p><strong>Stone Lymph</strong>: The kidneys govern water; when water congeals, it transforms into stones. When the kidneys are affected by heat and urination occurs, pain arises in the urethra, inhibiting smooth flow. If this pain extends to the lower abdomen, sand and stones may emerge in the urine, causing obstructions that lead to pain, dizziness, and profuse sweating before awakening; this is the result of the pain.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>The five types of lin (urinary disorders) are said to be caused by kidney deficiency; however, the small intestine is the reservoir for receiving and holding, with qi connecting to the bladder, which is the reservoir for fluids. Qi then connects to the kidneys, and when the residual flow fails to circulate, it is all labeled as insufficient kidney qi. Heat enters the bladder, causing the water pathways to become obstructed and ineffective, with frequent urination and urgent pain in the lower abdomen. Sometimes, it manifests as blood or thick fluid resembling bean juice. By using the specific formulas such as Wulin powder and Longnao Jisou pills, along with Xiangqiang pills and Shou Kidney Rehmannia pills, natural recovery can occur, as they effectively promote flow and replenish.</p>
<p>There are five kinds of lin: </p>
<ol>
<li>Shi lin (stone lin), caused by kidney heat forming stones, which block the water pathways and cause pain radiating to the bladder.</li>
<li>Qi lin (qi lin), arising from lung qi obstruction and heat, resulting in fullness in the lower abdomen and slow urination.</li>
<li>Re lin (heat lin), where heat in the three burners transmits to the kidneys and bladder, leading to painful and red urine.</li>
<li>Xue lin (blood lin), where heart heat disrupts the flow of blood, causing it to overflow and seep into the bladder.</li>
<li>Han lin (cold lin), which occurs when cold qi in the bladder contends with the righteous qi, causing cold-induced pain and obstruction.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>There are instances where a pregnant mother has excessive heat in her liver or where a wet nurse is angered, in which case one must address the heat stored in the five organs. If there is heat in the heart, use Daohong San with Huang Lian. If there is heat in the liver, use Chaihu Zhizi San. For constipation, use Xieqing Wan. If there is heat in the spleen, use Xiehuang San. For insufficient spleen qi, use Yigong San. If the spleen qi is deficient and sinking, use Buzhong Yiqi Tang. If there is heat in the lungs, use Xie Bai San. If there is deficiency-heat in the lung qi, use Yigong San with fried black gardenia. If there is heat in the kidneys, use Dihuang Wan. If the wet nurse has heat in the liver channel, use Zhizi Qinggan San. For those who are angered, use Chaihu Qinggan San. For wet nurses with rich food intake, use Jiawei Qingwei San. If there is heat in the heart and small intestine, use Qingxin Lianzi Yin. In cases where a child exhibits early signs of sexual desire, experiences difficulty or pain in urination, or has pain radiating after urination or bowel movements, these all pertain to insufficiency in the liver and kidneys. Use Liuwei Dihuang Wan, Bupi Yiqi Tang with niuxi (Achyranthes), cheqian (Plantago), and cinnamon; if not appropriate, consider the prevailing conditions of the five organs. Do not lightly use cold and draining medicines, as they can greatly diminish stomach qi, and still refer to the previously discussed case of constipation.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Urination and Defecation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Urination and defecation can be obstructed or difficult. This is due to heat affecting the organs, especially in the stomach and intestines. When there is heat in the stomach, bodily fluids diminish; with less fluid, the stool becomes dry and hard, making defecation difficult. This is known as obstruction; in severe cases, it can lead to an inability to defecate, which is termed as lack of passage. With urination, there can be dripping or blockage, which arises from heat in the small intestine and bladder. Both organs are responsible for water regulation. When heat invades, it reduces the fluids, resulting in urgency and dripping. In extreme cases, the passage is so dry that it cannot flow. If heat penetrates the large and small intestines, it causes stagnation and impedes smooth elimination, leading to both urination and defecation becoming blocked.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>There are five types of strangury: first is heat strangury, which is blood strangury; second is cold strangury, known as viscous strangury; third is qi strangury; fourth is labor strangury; fifth is accompanied strangury. Among these five types, children will have cases only of the three conditions: cold, heat, and qi. The two conditions of labor and stone are caused by extreme weakness. Children, not yet experiencing sexual desire, do not commonly suffer from this, but there may be rare cases of those who are inherently weak in the kidneys, which would be one in a thousand. Below, I will thoroughly describe the symptoms of the five types of strangury.</p>
<p>Heat strangury occurs when heat invades the small intestine and bladder. Both pathways control water; water enters the small intestine, transfers to the bladder, travels through the waterway, and is expelled as urine. Therefore, the pathway is for liquid, and the bladder is the repository for fluids. When heat is present, the waterway becomes dry and burnt, causing the flow to be obstructed, resulting in painful, difficulty in urination, hence the name strangury. Symptoms include infrequent urination, and small abdominal pain, connecting the navel to the root of the genitalia. When heat is excessive, there may be blood in the urine, thus also called blood strangury. When blood becomes heated, it disperses, seeps into the membrane, and flows downward with the urine.</p>
<p>Cold strangury occurs due to cold and dryness affecting the two pathways. Initial symptoms include chills followed by urination, indicating a struggle between evil energy and righteousness. If the cold energy prevails, chills and tremors occur; if righteousness prevails, the chills subside, and relief is found in urination, but the output is scant and obstructed, with pain in the lower abdomen. If cold is severe, the urine is white and viscous like a thick paste, hence also called viscous strangury. This is similar to dysentery; with heat, there is blood in the stool, and with cold, there is pus. Dysentery results from the clash of cold and heat in the large intestine; now strangury results from the clash of cold and heat in the small intestine.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>&quot;Qi Lin (dysuria) occurs when a child cries out of anger, causing the qi to enter the two meridians, stagnating and not dispersing. The邪 (pathogenic factor) and正 (healthy qi) clash, leading to internal pressure and swelling. The signs include abdominal distention beneath the navel, urinary tract obstruction, and pain in the genitals, often associated with residual dribbling. </p>
<p>Lao Lin (exhaustion dysuria) results from kidney deficiency and depleted essence, where qi is transmitted to the lower region, leading to dryness in the urinary tract. The kidneys and bladder are interrelated; when the kidneys are deficient and essential fluids are exhausted, the bladder also becomes deficient and unable to control its fluids. Thus, there is frequent urination and dryness in the urinary tract, leading to urinary retention in the urethra, frequent attempts to urinate without success, and pain that connects the small intestine to the urethra.&quot;<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>The kidney and bladder are interconnected. Now, if the kidney is deficient and essence is exhausted, then the bladder is also weakened, unable to control its water. Thus, fluids frequently leak out, and when the water pathways are dry, they cannot function smoothly, leading to urine being retained within and causing pain in the connection to the small intestine. </p>
<p>In cases of stone lin, the smaller ones are sand, and the larger ones are stones. It is commonly said that the kidney governs water, and when heat congeals, it transforms into stones. Although this reasoning is close, it fails to understand the essence. Additionally, the kidney consists of two organs: the left is the kidney, and the right is the life gate, which governs water and relates to the essence. The &quot;Shengji Jing&quot; states: the essence refers to the interplay of water and stone. Not knowing the path of water and stone, one does not grasp the profound interplay of generation and transformation. The original essence of Taiyi exists above, signified by water and established upon stone; this is the true substance inherent in the kidney. </p>
<p>For the patient, it is this true essence that transforms, resulting in the emergence of this true substance. The signs are that sand and stones exit through the water pathways, causing obstruction, pain, and distress, hence recovery is rare.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>Formula for Dihufuzi Decoction</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Medical Systematic Outline&quot; states: For children with prolapsed anus and bloody diarrhea that does not heal in late autumn, moxa one treatment on the turtle&#39;s tail, the size of a small wheat grain, at the end of the spine. For children with prolapse, moxa three times in the navel.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>If a child suffers from prolapse for a long time and has symptoms such as wind-induced seizures, retracted bow, excessive crying, incoherent speech, or untimely drooling, one should take the Baihui point and apply moxibustion seven times.

<p>According to &quot;The Comprehensive Medical Guide,&quot; for children with urinary leakage, needling the Qihai point by eight-tenths and applying moxibustion seven times is recommended. The Qihai, also known as Daan or Xiahuang, is located one and a half inches below the navel, in the center, and is regarded as the sea of vital energy for men.</p>

<p>Qian Yi&#39;s &quot;Elementary Principles of Pediatrics&quot; states: &quot;For a child suffering from prolapse for half a year, adhering to medicinal treatments that replenish original qi can lead to recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ai Zhu Weng&#39;s Discussions&quot; mentions: &quot;A child had a condition of qi lin (urinary difficulty). When Song Ningzong was a prince, he suffered from this illness, experiencing it three hundred times a day and night. The national doctors were at a loss, and someone recommended Sun Lin&#39;s treatment. Lin used garlic, light fermented soybean curd, and steamed cakes, which he ground into pills, instructing to take thirty of them with warm water. He stated: &#39;Today, take two doses, and the illness should decrease by a third; the same goes for tomorrow, and in three days, the illness will be cured.&#39; Eventually, it proved true, and he was rewarded with a thousand strings of cash. When asked about his reasoning, Lin replied: &#39;Why would a child have lin? It is simply because the water passage is hindered, and these three ingredients can promote unblocking.&#39;&quot;<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: The kind son of a liquor shop, thirteen years old, has suffered from sand and stone dysuria for nine years. Initially, due to the residual poison from a rash, he experienced bloody stools, and some advised him to take Taibai powder, which helped a little. Later, due to accumulated heat not dissipating, he developed a condition called Lin Bi, where every episode caused him to see spirits and scream, alarming the neighbors. A guest named Dai came to Dazhai Temple and inquired about this illness. Dai said: the doctors diagnose it as a kidney and small intestine issue, but that is not correct. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; mentions that the liver meridian can cause disorders related to urination, where blockage refers to inability to urinate, and dysuria signifies dripping. This is the disease of the Wood element, not of the small intestine or kidneys. The Wood element is suppressed, and Fire comes to counter it, hence the heat is in the bladder, tightening the lower jiao, creating sand and stone, similar to a soup kettle that, after prolonged boiling, reduces to lye. Now, if the bladders of sheep and pigs are inflated, they still cannot excrete properly; is it really possible for sand and stone to leak? Thus, one realizes that what was said before about taking five hundred pills leading to this is likely not entirely correct. The &quot;Neijing&quot; says: When Wood is stagnant, it needs to be released. First, use melon stem powder to alleviate it, then follow with the Ba Wu powder mixed with lye, consumed in equal parts; the sand and stones will transform and be expelled.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>There was a young boy from the village of the Zhang family, fourteen years old, who had been ill for about a year and a half. He fell ill during the wheat harvest season, suffering from severe pain in his intestines, which caused him to grip his abdomen (as if his blood were blocking), jump around, and cry out without pause. He had not urinated for several months; when he did, it was like sand and stones. His bowel movements were severely constipated, and his anus protruded by one or two inches. Many doctors were unable to cure him. </p>
<p>Upon hearing that a healer was staying at the Zhuge Temple for the summer, the boy’s father carried him there and wept to request help. The healer said, “Today we will treat him, and he will show results today, as it is the appropriate time.” He prepared a mixture to adjust the stomach and promote energy, adding three qian of cowherb root powder, boiling it in river water, and instructing the boy to swallow it three to five times. He also took sixty pills of bitter powder about the size of mustard seeds. By the evening, he experienced a sudden surge of both urination and defecation, releasing pus and blood all at once. Once the purging settled, he was told to drink a large cup of fresh, drawn water, and he was able to urinate well one or two times.</p>
<p>That night, he drank fresh water twenty to thirty times, and his illness improved by ninety percent, stopping his cries once. The next day, he lay exhausted as if drunk, from morning to evening, then suddenly got up and ran, asking for food from his mother, singing and laughing happily, having completely released his suffering. He continued to take Taibai powder and Bazheng powder for a day, and then made a full recovery. Concerned about his health in the hot weather, they stayed for five days before returning. The healer remarked, “This was a problem in the lower burner. If there is no vomiting or purging, how can the lower burner open? If you don’t allow drinking water, how can urination improve? Generally, a clear source leads to a clear flow.”<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>In Bai Pavilion, the son of Liu Shisan, aged six, suffered from a disease known as sand stone dripping. He was treated with a bitter agent three times and given a kidney remedy three times, resulting in immediate recovery. </p>
<p>According to the &quot;Childhood Medical Explanations&quot; by the Wan family: In our department, a girl reported that her urine was like blue water and that there were sores forming where it touched her flesh, causing her mother great worry. The physician asked if it might be that the girl’s organs were failing. The response was that the bladder stores the fluids of the five organs, which corresponds to urine. Each type of urine follows the color of the respective organ; the blue color is associated with the liver. The sores that formed were due to the excessive fire of the liver, which burned and caused decay. The physician treated her first with a remedy for red urine, then added a pill of yellow balsam. After five days of adjustment, she was stable.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br>The &quot;Essentials of Medicine&quot; says: The Tang family states: &quot;Liver wind causing head shaking is not recorded in various prescriptions.&quot; Zheng, the official, suffered from head shaking for seven years, with three years of blood in his stools. He had taken over a hundred prescriptions, all aimed at treating the head shaking with wind remedies, while those for stopping the bleeding resulted in either dysentery or intestinal wind, and none of the medicines were effective. After observing his illness and knowing the details, I still could not clarify the root cause. Reflecting on it, I concluded that the liver blood was abundant and was being invaded by external wind-heat. The liver belongs to wood; when it is abundant, the spleen, which is earth, is overpowered by wood, and since the spleen and lungs are like mother and child, both are defeated by the liver, leading to the blood saturating the stool, hence the continuous blood in the stools. Therefore, I prescribed a remedy that primarily reduces the liver, expels wind, and strengthens the spleen. It was initially just a momentary insight, but after a few doses, he was cured. More than ten days later, the bleeding stopped, and he began to pass white pus, and thus he was at peace.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror for Infants&quot; states: A young child had difficulty urinating and responded poorly to Five Ling Powder and similar treatments. The area under his chin and left cheek appeared red, indicating a deficiency of liver and kidney heat. He was treated with Si Wu Decoction plus mountain gardenia, which resulted in recovery. Later, after catching a cold, he was mistakenly treated with sweating methods, and the difficulty in urinating persisted. I then used a tonifying method, specifically the Middle Qi-Invigorating Decoction, adding wheat husk and five-flavor herbs to nourish the spleen and lungs, resulting in improvement.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>A small child has difficulty urinating and experiences pain in the shaft, or has blood in the urine, indicating that the kidneys are troubled by heat. First, use Wǔ Lín Sǎn to relieve this, followed by Zī Shèn Wán and Dì Huáng Wán to nourish the liver and kidneys, and gradually, he improves. If the child shows smallpox with a purplish hue, short and red urination, and the area between the chin and right jaw is either red or white, this reflects deficiency of lung and kidney qi alongside heat in the body. Use Bǔ Zhōng Yì Qì Tāng and Liù Wèi Dì Huáng Wán for recovery.</p>
<p>In &quot;Bǎo Yīng Cuò Yào,&quot; it is stated: a child has slight swelling of the eyelids, cough, nausea, and milky white urination. I suspect this is due to spleen dampness from food accumulation, so I use Wǔ Wèi Yì Gōng Sǎn, supplemented with Sì Wèi Féi Ér Wán, leading to recovery. Later, if there is no restraint in diet and vision becomes unclear, I say: the eyes are the essence of the five organs, and if the spleen and stomach are further harmed, nurturing is essential. If not believed, using harsh remedies may lead to a chronic spleen wind, resulting in further stagnation.</p>
<p>A three-year-old child, who has always wet the bed, is examined, revealing a slight redness under both jaws. This indicates a deficiency in the yin of the kidneys and bladder channels. Taking Liù Wèi Wán, the redness slowly diminishes, and bedwetting improves.</p>
<p>A four-year-old child has little appetite, experiences abdominal pain with diarrhea, and has always wet the bed; his forehead and jaw appear dark blue-black, and although it’s hot weather, he detests wind and cold. I say the teachings explain: if it&#39;s hot but not producing heat, there is no fire present. I prescribe Bā Wèi Wán, resolving all symptoms.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>A woman experienced either yellow or white urine, along with itching and watery discharge from the vulva. This indicated damp-heat in the liver channel. She was first treated with Longdan Xiegan Decoction and subsequently received a modified version of Xiaoyao Powder with added Longdan Grass, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A child had nodules behind each ear and at the back of the head, white and turbid urine, a pale yellow complexion, fatigue, dry mouth, and irregular bowel movements. After taking Aloe Vera Pills, he recovered. Later, he developed sores with itching at the outer nose, continued to have white urine, and blurry vision. He was treated with Four-Flavored Fat Child Pills and recovered.</p>
<p>Another child had difficulty urinating, nosebleeds, and a red nose, indicating heat in the spleen and lungs. He was treated with Jisheng Xijiao Dihuang Decoction and recovered. Later, there was persistent redness between the chin and a feeling of thirst with phlegm, suggesting insufficient kidney qi. He was treated with Dihuang Pills, resolving all symptoms.</p>
<p>A child who experienced dysentery and rectal prolapse had little appetite, a bluish-yellow complexion, and thought that his spleen and earth element was deficient, which allowed the liver wood to dominate. When he did not believe this, he took an alternative remedy for stagnation and experienced abdominal pain and bloating, along with fatigue and vomiting. I indicated that the spleen qi was severely deficient. When he still did not believe it and continued to take the previous medication, his abdomen became more bloated and heavy, his limbs swollen, and he requested treatment again while wanting to address stagnation. I stated that the heaviness and bloating indicated sinking spleen qi.</p>
<p>Initially, he was given Wuwei Yigong San with added Mu Xiang for four doses. When his hands and feet became cold, four doses of Gan Jiang were added, and gradually his abdominal bloating improved. Later, due to excessive eating, he experienced diarrhea and rectal prolapse. He was treated with Buzhong Yiqi Decoction with added Mu Xiang and Wuwei Yigong San and recovered.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>A young child had hemorrhoids for half a year, experiencing diarrhea in the morning, with prominent white in the eyes. I prescribed a tonic for the spleen&#39;s qi, but it did not respond. I concluded that the condition was due to kidney deficiency, as the kidneys open to the two orifices. I then used the Four God Pills and a decoction to tonify the middle and augment qi, resulting in recovery within a month.</p>
<p>Another young child had long-lasting dysentery leading to hemorrhoids, with much white in the eyes, and a gradually yellowing complexion. I applied the decoction to tonify the middle and augment qi, along with the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill, to tonify the spleen and kidneys, which cured the child.</p>
<p>A young child experienced frequent and urgent urination, followed by dysentery and hemorrhoids, which persisted without improvement. I suspected it was due to congenital kidney deficiency and used the Six-Flavor Rehmannia Pill, which then resulted in recovery. Later, the child suffered from diarrhea and a husky cough; I prescribed the same pills, leading to a cure.</p>
<p>In another case, a young child had hemorrhoids and was treated with cold and cooling medicines. The child showed signs of fatigue, reduced appetite, and a sense of heaviness in the anal area, indicating a deficiency in spleen qi and sinking of the middle qi. I used the decoction to tonify the middle and augment qi, adding wine-fried peony, white atractylodes, and poria, which led to recovery.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br>A young child suffered from prolapse of the rectum, accompanied by swelling, pain, and bleeding for over a year without recovery. Suddenly, the child vomited blood and passed blood-stained stools, all turning into purple clots. This was due to accumulated heat in the intestines and stomach, so I promptly used Shengji Xijiao Dihuang Decoction to stop the symptoms; I also ground honeysuckle and licorice into a powder, mixed it with warm water, and administered it for half a year until the child was cured.</p>
<p>Another young child experienced prolapse of the rectum, and a variety of medicines were used to dispel dampness, expel wind, and stop bleeding. The child appeared pallid and weak, with little appetite and blood in the stool. I intended to tonify the spleen to consolidate the blood, but instead used herbal remedies like Four Substances and Sophora Flower, which worsened the bleeding and caused increased vomiting. I first treated the condition with Four Gentlemen Decoction and wood fragrance, gradually restoring energy and halting the blood in the stool. Then I applied the Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, further using hemp seeds to apply to the top of the head until the child recovered.</p>
<p>A young child developed cough and took medications to resolve phlegm, but treatment was inconsistent. After taking a pill for phlegm, the child instead experienced diarrhea, had cold hands and feet, and showed signs of muscle twitching, with the rectum protruding and reddened. In the morning, I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and in the evening, I treated with Liu Jun Zi Decoction. Gradually, the various symptoms improved, but the rectal prolapse remained. I continued administering Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, and recovery was achieved.</p>
<p>Another young child suffered from dysentery with red or painful prolapse of the rectum. I used Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, along with Xianglian Pill, and the child recovered. Later, after dietary indiscretion caused diarrhea and the rectum again prolapsed and could not be reinserted, I employed the previous decoction in addition to grinding hemp seeds to apply to the forehead, resulting in healing.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child consumed too many water chestnuts, leading to abdominal distension and fever, with difficulty in passing stools and blood in the urine. I first used a digestive pill, which immediately relieved constipation and stopped the blood in the urine; I then administered Baohe Pill and Yigong Powder until the child fully recovered.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>A small child, due to the wet nurse drinking alcohol, had blood in the urine. Using Ba Zheng San with added Da Huang, Gan Ge, Shan Zhi, and Lou Lu, both mother and child recovered after taking it.</p>
<p>A small child saw blood in the urine, or had a cough with hemoptysis. This was due to deficiency heat in the spleen and lungs. After eating, Sheng Ji Xi Jiao Di Huang Tang was used, and before eating, Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, leading to immediate recovery. Later, due to consuming rich foods, the issue recurred, treated with Jia Wei Qing Wei San and Liu Wei Wan, resulting in recovery.</p>
<p>A small child suffered from long-term blood in the stools, indicating deficiency heat in the spleen and stomach. Traditional remedies did not respond. A remedy was made using two taels of Ren Shen, half a tael each of toasted Huang Lian and Wu Zhu Yu, powdered and made into rice paste pills; with the assistance of Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, the child was promptly cured.</p>
<p>A small child had blood in the stools, was pale with abdominal swelling, treated with Si Wei Fei Er Wan, and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with added Wu Zhu Yu, Huang Lian, Mu Xiang, and Wu Yi over thirty doses, leading to recovery. In summer, the child suffered from bloody dysentery, fever, afternoon heat, and swelling in the hands and feet, but recovered using the previous medications.</p>
<p>An eight-year-old boy had abdominal distension, a protruding navel, stools like dysentery with blood, red-colored urine resembling blood, a yellow face, and red cheeks. This was caused by food accumulation harming the liver. The spleen&#39;s illness led to lung deficiency, unable to nourish the kidneys, causing these symptoms. First, the food stagnation needed to be resolved, so Yao Ju Wan was used with added San Leng and Peng Zhu, taken with ginger broth in four doses, clearing both urination and defecation. Additionally, Da An Wan was administered in two doses, stopping the blood in the stools. Later, due to improper eating leading to fever, abdominal distension, and blood in the urine, Bao He Wan was given in four doses, resulting in recovery.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>A young child had insufficient qi and occasionally bled from the rectum. He was treated with Liuwei Dihuang Wan and Buzhong Yiqi Tang, and he recovered. Later, due to his mother drinking and roasting, the condition recurred. His mother took Jiawei Qingwei San, while the child took Dihuang Wan, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>A different child experienced rectal bleeding, had hot feet, and had bad-smelling, ulcerated gums. In the morning, he took Liuwei Dihuang Wan, and in the evening, he used Yigong San with wild chrysanthemum. After a month, he gradually improved. He was then supplemented with Buzhong Yiqi Tang and fully recovered.</p>
<p>Another child, who inherited his father&#39;s kidney qi, experienced rectal bleeding and thirst, had hot feet, and was slim. He was treated with Liuwei Wan and soon recovered. On the fourth day after developing smallpox, he experienced hot feet and thirst, wanting to drink cold water. The previous herbal mixture was decocted, and he drank three doses, after which his feet cooled, the thirst stopped, and the smallpox settled quietly.</p>
<p>A child had rectal bleeding, a pale face, flank pain, and frequent urination. This was due to the liver&#39;s wood element harming the spleen&#39;s earth element, which could not regulate properly. Yigong San was administered, with added fried Chaihu and Longdancao in two doses. The liver symptoms subsided, and the bleeding stopped after using Yigong San again.</p>
<p>Another child had rectal bleeding accompanied by fever and thirst, wanting to drink cold water. A dose of Huanglian Jiedu Tang was taken hot, and all symptoms quickly resolved. Later, due to excessive dietary harm, he experienced significant rectal bleeding, fever, fatigue, and a reduced appetite. He was first treated with Buzhong Yiqi Tang, and his vitality was restored, leading to an increase in appetite. He was then given Sijun San with the addition of Shengma and achieved a full recovery.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>A young child had bloody stools, was thirsty and ate little. First, a Seven Herb Bai Zhu Powder was used, which alleviated thirst and improved appetite; then a Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction was used, leading to recovery. Later, after consuming raw and cold foods, the child experienced abdominal distension and constipation. Baohuan Pills were employed, resulting in blood in the urine and occasional convulsions, indicating spleen qi damage and liver fire disturbance. Yigong Powder with added Gou Teng and Chai Hu stopped the convulsions; further addition of Sheng Ma and Mu Xiang helped stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>Another young child consumed raw and cold fruits, leading to abdominal distension and pain, fever, thirst, and difficulty in bowel movements, along with blood in the urine. A Fujing Powder with added Huang Lian was used, resulting in bowel movements that relieved the urinary blood.</p>
<p>One child with bloody urine and hot feet was cured with Liu Wei Di Huang Pills. Later, after suffering from long-term dysentery that caused bloody urine and thirst with a desire for cold drinks, previous pills were prepared and taken alongside Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>A young child had bloody urine, a pale face, and pain in the sides with frequent urination. Wuwu Yigong Powder was used, with added Chai Hu (stir-fried black) and Long Dan Cao, followed by Di Huang Pills leading to recovery.</p>
<p>An eleven-year-old child, after becoming overheated from exertion, experienced bloody urine and difficulty urinating. Initially, Qing Xin Lian Zi Drink was given in two doses, then Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with added Shan Zhi was used, resulting in cure.</p>
<p>One child had bloody stools from excessive cold medication, with abdominal distension and difficulty in urination, leading to increased bleeding. The next morning, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction was given, followed in the evening with Jin Gui Shen Qi Pills adjusted, resulting in healing.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

<p>小儿二便门</p>
<p>　　　　儒门事亲 【 元张从政】</p>
<p>　　　　　大小便不通</p>
<p>　　凡小儿大小便不通，《内经》谓三焦约。约者不行也，可用长流水煎八正散时时灌之，大小便利则止。若不因热药所攻而致此者，易治；或因多服热药而燥剧至此者，非惟难治，不幸夭耳。亦可用蜜水调益元散送通膈丸。<br>　　　　　淋沥</p>
<p>　　小儿病沙石淋及五种淋沥闭癃，并脐腹痛，益元散主之，以长流水调下。八正散、石苇散，依方服用。此三药皆可加减服之。　　小儿病沙石淋及五种淋沥癃闭，并脐腹痛，益元散主之，以长流水调下。盖因热在膀胱，燥其津液，故俗谓冷淋者，天下之通弊也。五淋散减桂加益元散，名曰淡渗散。<br>　　　　婴童百问 【 明鲁伯嗣】<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<p>　　　　　大小便不通</p>
<p>　　议曰：调理婴孩伤寒，体热头目昏沉，不思饮食，夹驾夹食，寒热，大小便闭濇不通，烦躁作渴，冷汗妄流，夹积伤滞，膈满胀急，青黄体瘦，日夜大热，及疗伤风、伤暑、惊癎、客忤、肾脏疳气等热，并宜脱甲散主之。亦可服大连翘汤加大黄、神芎，治小儿惊风积热，大小便濇滞，其效尤速。又掩脐法：用连根葱一根，不洗带泥土，生姜一片，淡豆豉二十一粒，盐二匙，同研烂，捏饼烘热掩脐中，以绵扎定，良久气透自通，不然另换一剂。小便不通亦可。<br>　　　　　大便不通</p>
<p>　　议曰：小儿大便秘，乃是肺家有热在里，流入大肠，以致秘结不通乃实热也，当以四顺清凉饮加柴胡。热甚者加山栀、黄芩流利之。其表里俱热者，面黄颊赤，唇燥口干，小便赤濇，大便焦黄，无汗者，先解表以柴胡散汗之；解后大便秘或肚疼者，以清凉饮、大柴胡汤、承气汤皆可下之。积热者，神芎丸尤妙。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>　　　　　小便不通</p>
<p>　　汤氏云：凡小儿小便不通，皆因心经不顺，或伏热，或惊起，心火上攻，不能降济，肾水不能上升，故使心经愈热，而小肠与心合，所以小便不通，木通汤主之，甚者八正散。又小便不通，脐腹胀闷，心神烦热，栀子仁散主之。积热者，神芎丸效。<br>　　　　　遗尿</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：遗尿者，此由膀胱有冷，不能约于水故也。肾主水，肾气下通于阴。小便者，水之余也。膀胱为津液之府，既冷气衰弱，不能约水，故遗尿也。杨氏云：小儿尿床，由膀胱冷，夜属阴，小便不禁，睡里自出，宜破故纸散治之。益智之剂，亦不可阙。<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>　　　　　尿白浊</p>
<p>　　汤氏云：小儿尿白者，由乳哺不节，过伤于脾，故使清浊不分，而尿白如米泔也，久则成疳。亦心脾伏热，兼而得之，宜疏脾土，消食化积，通利小腑也，茯苓散主之。三棱散、消食丸可选而用之。分清饮亦可服。<br>　　　　　便血脏毒</p>
<p>　　议曰：儿生七日之内，大小便有血出者，此由胎气热盛之所致也。母食酒面炙煿热物，流入心肺，儿在胎内，受其热毒，亦传心肺。且女子热入心，故小便有之；男子热入肺，故大肠有之。血出淡淡，有似胚水，盛则其血加鲜。凡遇有此不可以他药，只以生地黄根取自然汁，入蜜少许和匀，温温与服，移时自安，男子皆效，甘露饮宜兼与服。茅根、茅花煎浓汤服亦效。犀角地黄汤亦可服。脏毒聚金丸用之效。地黄丸亦可用。有瘀血者，桃仁承气汤下之。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　　脱肛并痔证</p>
<p>　　汤氏方治脱肛，大肠自粪门出，宜用葱汤熏洗令软，款款送上。此因泻利得之者，方可服泻利之药，然后用槐花等药。又有用一味五倍子煎汤，入(石卜)硝熏洗而缩者；又有用真蒲黄碾极细，以猪胆拌匀敷肛门上而入者。《全婴方》用濇肠散。兼有痔证肿痛者，用黄丹、滑石等分，井水调涂即消；并用铅白霜半钱，片脑半字，好酒调敷肿处甚佳。黄连解毒汤亦可服。用苦参汤洗亦效。亦有密陀僧、白矾、片脑末敷上，更用荆芥、防风等项洗之。用生瓜蒌根者效。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>　　　　　五淋</p>
<p>　　巢氏云：小儿诸淋者，肾与膀胱热也。膀胱与肾为表里，俱主水。水入小肠，下于胞，行于阴为小便也。膀胱热则津液内涸，水道不通，停积于胞，肾气热则濇，故令水道不利，小便淋沥，故谓之淋。其状小便出少而数，其小腹急痛引脐是也。又有石淋、气淋、热淋、血淋、寒淋，五淋形证，各有说焉。　　其石淋者，淋而出砂石也。肾与热所乘则化为石，小便茎中痛，尿不能卒出，时自痛引，膀胱里急，砂石从小便而出也。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　其气淋者，肾与膀胱受肺之热气则胀，气为热所乘，故流入膀胱，则气壅不散，小腹气满，水不宣利，故小便濇而成淋也。　　其热淋者，三焦有热气，得于肾与膀胱，故热气流入于胞而成淋也。　　其血淋者，是热之盛，甚则尿血，谓之血淋。心主血，其热甚者，血则散漫失其常经，渗溢入胞而成血淋矣。　　若寒淋者，其病状先寒战，然后尿是也。小儿取冷过度，下焦受之，冷气入于胞，正气交争，寒气正气相胜则战，寒气解，故得小便也。　　治淋之法，金砂散立效。五苓散、木通散等剂，机变用药，必可求痊。导赤散亦效。与大方脉相参用药，不亦可乎？<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　　　明医杂着 【 明王纶】</p>
<p>　　　　　大小便白</p>
<p>　　小儿大小便，时时审看小便如米泔，或澄停少顷，变作泔浊，此脾胃湿热也。若大便油白色，或如鱼冻，或带红，或色黄黑，此积滞湿热也，宜理脾消滞，清中宫，去湿热，节饮食。若忽然变青，此是变蒸也，不必用药。若久不愈，用补脾制肝药一二服，亦不宜多用。　　【 注　按小便如泔，或大便泔白，宜用肥儿丸。若积滞黄黑，宜用四君子加黄连、木香。若色青日久不复，或兼泄泻，或兼腹痛，当用六君子加木香、芍药。若肌体色黄，小便不利，发黄脱落，鼻下疮痍，嗜土少食，大便青褐色者，须用栀子茯苓汤。】<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>　　　　古今医统 【 明徐春甫】</p>
<p>　　　　　遗尿</p>
<p>　　小儿遗尿者，此由膀胱有冷，不能约于水，故遗尿也。又有尿来者，亦由膀胱冷，夜属阴，小便不禁，胞里自出，谓之尿来也。用破故纸散、益智仁散、鸡肠散服。<br>　　　　保婴撮要 【 明薛铠】</p>
<p>　　　　　遗尿</p>
<p>　　肾主水，与足太阳相为表里。经曰：膀胱者州都之官，津液藏焉。卧则阳气内收，肾与膀胱之气虚寒，不能约制，故睡中遗出，《内经》谓膀胱不约为遗溺是也。用破故纸散、益智散、鸡肠散之类主之。亦有热客于肾，干于足厥阴之经，廷孔郁结，而血气不能宣通，则痿痹而无所用，故液渗入膀胱，而漩溺遗失者，用六味地黄丸。虚热亦用前丸。脾肺气虚者，用补中益气汤加补骨脂、山茱萸。<br>　　　　证治准绳 【 明王肯堂】<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p>
<p>　　　　　大小便不通</p>
<p>　　翰林待诏杨大邺问：小儿大小便闭濇者为何？答曰：乳食失度，使之四大不调，滋味有贪，遂乃五脏受病，甘甜聚食，咸酸滞涎，食滞留结于肠胃，风壅渍癖于心肺，气脉不顺，水谷不行，不壅逆于上焦。即秘结于下部，小儿不知疼痛，莫说因由，惊啼叫以频频，但怒胀而不乳，不知孩儿痛刺连脐，则面色青黄，但按脉息与治。若不见病源，只依外变用药，安能克效？<br>　　　　　大便不通</p>
<p>　　此因乳母或儿膏粱积热，及六淫七情，郁火传儿为患者，用清邪解郁之剂。禀赋怯弱，早近色欲，大便难而小便牵痛者，用滋补肺肾之剂。《褚氏遗书》云：男子精未满而御女以通其精，则四体有不满之处，异日有难状之疾。老人阴已痿而思色，以降其精，则精不出而内败，精已耗而复竭之，则大小便牵痛如淋。今童子即有此患，益见今人所禀，与古人大径庭矣。人之气血厚薄既殊，而医之用药疗法，又岂可泥执古方而无加减之变乎？<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　　　　小便不通</p>

<p><strong>Children&#39;s Issues with Urination and Bowel Movements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Confucian Teaching on Filial Piety</strong>  【Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Congzheng】</p>
<p><strong>Obstruction of Urination and Bowel Movements</strong></p>
<p>In cases where children experience difficulties with urination and bowel movements, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions the Sanjiao (Triple Warmer) as a point of obstruction. &quot;Obstruction&quot; indicates that movement is hindered. One may use Longliushui (long-running water) to decoct the Bajing San (Eight Corrective Powder) and administer it at intervals until normal urination and defecation resume. If this condition does not arise from heat caused by medicinal treatment, it is easy to remedy; however, if it is due to excessive consumption of heating medicines leading to severe dryness, it becomes not only difficult to treat but may tragically result in death. One may also utilize honey water to mix with Yiyuan San (Enhancement of Vitality Powder) and then administer Tongge Wan (Open Barrier Pill).</p>
<p><strong>Dysuria</strong></p>
<p>For children suffering from sand and stone dysuria as well as five types of painful urination, accompanied by abdominal pain in the navel area, the Yiyuan San serves as the main remedy when mixed with Longliushui for administration. The Bajing San and Shihui San (Stone Rush Powder) may be consumed according to recipe guidelines. All three medicines can be adjusted in dosage. The reason is due to heat in the bladder, which dries up the fluids; hence, the common term &quot;cold dysuria&quot; pertains to universal ailments. The Wuling San (Five Dysuria Powder) can be modified by reducing cinnamon and adding Yiyuan San, thus creating the Dan Shen San (Mild Drainage Powder). </p>

<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> When treating infants with a febrile condition, if the body is hot and the mind is clouded, leading to a lack of appetite, accompanied by chills, fever, and constipation, with anxiety and excessive sweating, indicating stagnation, fullness, and urgency in the abdomen, and a thin yellow body, enduring high fever day and night, as well as for conditions like wind, heatstroke, convulsions, and kidney disorders, a remedy such as Detoxicating Powder should be administered. One may also take a decoction of Forsythia with Radish and Angelica to treat pediatric convulsions related to accumulated heat and constipation, yielding quick results. Additionally, one can employ the navel-covering method: use a whole green onion without washing off the dirt, a slice of ginger, twenty-one fermented soybeans, and two teaspoons of salt, crush them together, form into a hot cake, and place it over the navel, secured with cotton. After a while, this should help facilitate passage; if not, a different remedy should be used. Inability to urinate can also be addressed this way.</p>
<p><strong>Inability to Defecate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion:</strong> When a child is constipated, it signifies internal heat in the lungs flowing into the large intestine, causing obstruction. This is due to actual heat and should be treated with a cooling drink, adding Bupleurum if necessary. For significant heat, adding Gardenia and Scutellaria will help relieve it. If there is heat both internally and externally, characterized by a yellowish face, red cheeks, dry lips, and dry mouth, with red and scanty urination and dark yellow feces, with no sweating, one should first release the exterior using Bupleurum to induce sweating. After this, if constipation or abdominal pain persists, one may use cooling drinks, Major Bupleurum Decoction, or Chengqi Decoction to address it. For accumulated heat, Shenqi Pill is particularly effective.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Difficulty in Urination</strong></p>
<p>Tang stated: In the case of children with difficulty in urination, it is due to an imbalance in the heart&#39;s meridian, either from hidden heat or from fright. The heart fire rises, which cannot be subdued, causing the kidney water to fail to rise. This leads to an increase in heart heat, and since the small intestine is associated with the heart, difficulty in urination occurs. Mú Tōng Decoction is the primary remedy, with more severe cases treated by the Ba Zheng San. Additionally, for cases with abdominal distension, irritability, and heat, the Zhi Zi Ren San is indicated. For accumulated heat, Shen Qiong Wan is effective.</p>
<p><strong>Enuresis</strong></p>
<p>Chao noted: Enuresis occurs because of cold in the bladder, which cannot control the release of urine. The kidneys govern water, and kidney energy descends to the yin. Urination is merely the excess of water. The bladder serves as the reservoir for fluids; when cold energy weakens, it cannot contain water, leading to enuresis. Yang mentioned: Bedwetting in children is due to cold in the bladder; during the night, which belongs to yin, urination cannot be controlled, and it occurs unconsciously during sleep, and thus the Po Gu Zhi San should be used for treatment. Additionally, a tonic for enhancing intellect should not be omitted.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Cloudy Urine</strong></p>
<p>Tang’s commentary states: When a child&#39;s urine is cloudy, it is due to irregular breastfeeding, which damages the spleen, preventing the clear and turbid from being distinguished, resulting in urine that resembles rice wash. If this persists, it could lead to consumption. Additionally, there may be hidden heat in the heart and spleen, and it is advisable to clear the spleen, eliminate food stagnation, and relieve the small intestines. Fuling Powder is indicated for this. Sanling Powder and Digestive Pills can also be used. Drinking the Clear Beverage is also acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Blood in Stool and Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>It is said: If a child has blood in their urine or stool within seven days after birth, this is due to excess heat from the fetal energy. If the mother consumes hot food, alcohol, or roasted items, the heat and toxins enter the heart and lungs, affecting the child in utero and also transferring to the heart and lungs. If the heat enters the heart of the girl, she may have blood in her urine; if it enters the lungs of the boy, it may appear in the stool. If the blood is light and watery, it resembles amniotic fluid, and if severe, the blood may appear bright red. In such cases, do not use other medicines; instead, take the root of fresh Rehmannia, extract its juice, mix it with a little honey, and administer it warm. This will bring relief over time; it is effective for boys. Guo Lu Beverage is also suitable to take alongside. A strong decoction of reed root and flowers can also be effective. Xi Jiao Di Huang Decoction is also acceptable. Zang Du Ju Jin Wan can be used for effectiveness. Di Huang Wan is also applicable.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Five Types of Dysuria</strong></p>
<p>Nest&#39;s words: The dysuria in children is due to heat in the kidneys and bladder. The bladder and kidneys are interrelated, both governing water. Water enters the small intestine, descends to the bladder, and through the lower pathways results in urination. When there is heat in the bladder, fluids dry up internally, obstructing the water pathways, leading to accumulation in the bladder. When the kidney qi is hot, it becomes thick, thus causing the water pathways to be obstructed, resulting in dripping urination, hence it is called dysuria. The condition presents with small amounts of urine that are frequent, along with urgent pain in the lower abdomen that radiates to the navel.</p>
<p>There are also stone dysuria, qi dysuria, heat dysuria, blood dysuria, and cold dysuria, each with its specific explanations. </p>
<p>The stone dysuria is characterized by the passage of sand and stones. When the kidneys are affected by heat, they can transform it into stones; thus, pain occurs in the urethra, making it difficult to urinate, with intermittent sharp pains. The bladder feels urgent, and sand and stones are expelled during urination.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The condition of painful urination due to clear urine occurs when the kidneys and bladder receive the heat qi from the lungs, causing swelling. The qi is overwhelmed by heat, hence it flows into the bladder, resulting in a stagnation of qi, a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen, and difficulty in urination, leading to painful urination.</p>
<p>The condition of painful urination due to heat arises when there is heat qi in the three burners, received in the kidneys and bladder; thus, the heat qi flows into the bladder and causes painful urination.</p>
<p>The condition of painful urination with blood is due to excessive heat; in severe cases, it results in blood in the urine, referred to as blood-tinged painful urination. The heart governs blood, and when the heat is severe, the blood disperses and loses its normal channels, seeping into the bladder and resulting in painful urination with blood.</p>
<p>In cases of painful urination due to cold, the symptoms begin with chills and shivering, followed by urination. Children may experience excessive cold exposure, affecting the lower burner; the cold qi enters the bladder, where the righteous qi contends with the cold qi. If the cold qi overcomes the righteous qi, shivering occurs, and when the cold resolves, urination can occur.</p>
<p>To treat painful urination, Jinsha San is effective. Other formulas like Wuling San and Mutong San can be modified for treatment, leading to a potential cure. Daohong San is also effective.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Inability to Pass Urine and Stool</strong></p>
<p>Hanlin Waiting Scholar Yang Daye asked: What is the reason for a child’s inability to pass urine and stool? The answer is: Overindulgence in milk and food disrupts the four bodily humors, and due to a craving for tastes, the internal organs become ill. Sweet and rich food causes dampness and stagnation, leading to blockages in the intestines and stomach. Wind obstructs and burdens the heart and lungs, causing the flow of qi to be unregulated, and water and food cannot move freely without obstructing upward. Thus, they are bound in the lower body. The child, unaware of pain, may not articulate the reasons; they cry out in distress repeatedly, getting angry and swollen but refusing milk. They don&#39;t realize the sharp pain that reaches the navel, resulting in a pale or greenish complexion. One should then examine the pulse and breath to treat. If the source of illness is not identified and treatment relies solely on external symptoms using medicine, how can one expect effective results?</p>
<p><strong>Inability to Pass Stool</strong></p>
<p>This is due to the wet nurse or rich foods causing heat accumulation and the six excesses and seven emotions, with afflictive fire being transmitted to the child. One should use remedies to clear the evil and resolve the pent-up condition. If the child is constitutionally weak or has developed desires prematurely, leading to difficult bowel movements with associated pain during urination, one should use tonics for the lungs and kidneys. The &quot;Collected Writings of the Zhu Family&quot; states: A man with insufficient essence who engages with a woman to release his essence may have unresolved deficiencies in his body, leading to difficult ailments later. When an old man, whose essence is already depleted yet desires intimacy, tries to release his essence, it does not come forth and he internally deteriorates. If essence is exhausted and further depleted, he may experience pain during urination and defecation. Currently, young boys may suffer from this ailment, further illustrating the differences between modern individuals and those of ancient times. As human vitality and blood thickness vary greatly, how can physicians adhere rigidly to ancient prescriptions without adjusting for change?<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Difficulty in Urination</strong></p>
<p>When an infant experiences difficulty in urination, there are two patterns: Yin obstruction and Yang obstruction. Yin obstruction is due to cold and dampness infiltrating the body, causing blockage, known as Yin closure. For this, a decoction of white peony root can be used along with southern wood fragrance; additionally, roasted salt wrapped in cloth can be heated and applied around the navel. Also, combining five-ingredient powder with fine sand and taking it in salt water on an empty stomach can yield rapid results.</p>
<p>Yang obstruction occurs due to extreme heat, leading to dryness and blockage, known as Yang closure. There are also distinctions between retention and dysuria. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states that difficulty in the bladder leads to retention, which is due to weak internal organ energy being obstructed by heat, preventing proper flow; it is neither a painful condition nor one associated with excessive volume, but rather a simple blockage without the ability to pass urine. Symptoms include abdominal distension and tightness; for treatment, one can use five-ingredient powder plus plantain and lungwort, or herbal mixtures like Muxiang powder, Jade Dew drink, or Yiyuan powder. Alternatively, placing a ginger and fermented bean cake on the navel can also be effective, regardless of whether it is Yin or Yang obstruction, and Wan&#39;an drink is especially beneficial.</p>
<p>Dongyuan states that issues with urination differ between Qi and Blood. The bladder, governed by the foot Taiyang, is essential for urination; it grows in the time of Shen, aligning with metal, which generates water. If there is heat trapped in the lungs, water cannot be produced, leading to a cessation of the source of urination.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Enuresis</p>
<p>The &quot;Original Disease Formula&quot; states that enuresis is caused by cold. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; mentions that incontinence is referred to as &quot;unrestrained urination.&quot; Ren Zhai observes that urination is a residue of bodily fluids. The kidneys govern water while the bladder is the organ for these fluids. When both the kidneys and bladder are deficient and cold pathogens take over, they cannot restrain water, resulting in involuntary urination, known as enuresis. If it occurs during sleep, it is called bedwetting. These conditions arise from both the kidneys and bladder lacking strength and being affected by cold, and they can be treated with Ji Chang San. </p>
<p>Zeng Shi states that the transmission between the heart and kidneys is out of balance, while the small intestine and bladder cannot properly regulate. Those who wet the bed while dreaming are also experiencing deficiencies and cold in the lower regions. Due to insufficient vital Yang energy, the &quot;Three Causes Formula&quot; along with Jiu Zi Wan is used for treatment, as are Shen Ling Bai Zhu San and Bu Shen Di Huang Wan. However, it is necessary to strengthen the earth to preserve the water, thus preventing leakage. The principle is that boosting the kidneys is not as effective as boosting the spleen. Ping Wei San can be doubled with added Yi Zhi Ren, ground finely, and decocted with ginger, dates, and salt, taken warm on an empty stomach.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Lymphatic Disorders</strong></p>
<p>All lymphatic disorders arise from kidney deficiency. The kidneys and bladder are interrelated; when water flows into the small intestine, it communicates with the bladder and produces urine from the lower part of the body. Kidney qi connects with the lower, and this is the pathway for fluids. There are five types of lymphatic disorders: Khao, Cold, Heat, Blood, and Stone, each to be described later.</p>
<p><strong>Khao Lymph</strong>: When urination contains a fatty substance resembling grease, floating in the urine, it indicates kidney deficiency that fails to regulate the fat and allow it to flow downward.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Lymph</strong>: It starts with chills followed by urination; this is also due to kidney deficiency causing the lower jiao to be cold. Cold qi enters the bladder, contending with righteous qi, hence the urine becomes thick and there are chills.</p>
<p><strong>Heat Lymph</strong>: This occurs when there is heat in the lower jiao; the heat qi transmits to the kidneys, flowing into the bladder. Consequently, the urine is frequently yellow and thick, sometimes accompanied by fresh blood.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Lymph</strong>: This is an extreme form of heat. The heart governs the blood and channels externally while operating on organs internally. When heat is intense, it disrupts its normal pathway. The heart and small intestine are interrelated, thus it flows down into the bladder, resulting in blood lymph.</p>
<p><strong>Stone Lymph</strong>: The kidneys govern water; when water congeals, it transforms into stones. When the kidneys are affected by heat and urination occurs, pain arises in the urethra, inhibiting smooth flow. If this pain extends to the lower abdomen, sand and stones may emerge in the urine, causing obstructions that lead to pain, dizziness, and profuse sweating before awakening; this is the result of the pain.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

<p>Urination and defecation can be obstructed or difficult. This is due to heat affecting the organs, especially in the stomach and intestines. When there is heat in the stomach, bodily fluids diminish; with less fluid, the stool becomes dry and hard, making defecation difficult. This is known as obstruction; in severe cases, it can lead to an inability to defecate, which is termed as lack of passage. With urination, there can be dripping or blockage, which arises from heat in the small intestine and bladder. Both organs are responsible for water regulation. When heat invades, it reduces the fluids, resulting in urgency and dripping. In extreme cases, the passage is so dry that it cannot flow. If heat penetrates the large and small intestines, it causes stagnation and impedes smooth elimination, leading to both urination and defecation becoming blocked.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are five types of strangury: first is heat strangury, which is blood strangury; second is cold strangury, known as viscous strangury; third is qi strangury; fourth is labor strangury; fifth is accompanied strangury. Among these five types, children will have cases only of the three conditions: cold, heat, and qi. The two conditions of labor and stone are caused by extreme weakness. Children, not yet experiencing sexual desire, do not commonly suffer from this, but there may be rare cases of those who are inherently weak in the kidneys, which would be one in a thousand. Below, I will thoroughly describe the symptoms of the five types of strangury.</p>
<p>Heat strangury occurs when heat invades the small intestine and bladder. Both pathways control water; water enters the small intestine, transfers to the bladder, travels through the waterway, and is expelled as urine. Therefore, the pathway is for liquid, and the bladder is the repository for fluids. When heat is present, the waterway becomes dry and burnt, causing the flow to be obstructed, resulting in painful, difficulty in urination, hence the name strangury. Symptoms include infrequent urination, and small abdominal pain, connecting the navel to the root of the genitalia. When heat is excessive, there may be blood in the urine, thus also called blood strangury. When blood becomes heated, it disperses, seeps into the membrane, and flows downward with the urine.</p>
<p>Cold strangury occurs due to cold and dryness affecting the two pathways. Initial symptoms include chills followed by urination, indicating a struggle between evil energy and righteousness. If the cold energy prevails, chills and tremors occur; if righteousness prevails, the chills subside, and relief is found in urination, but the output is scant and obstructed, with pain in the lower abdomen. If cold is severe, the urine is white and viscous like a thick paste, hence also called viscous strangury. This is similar to dysentery; with heat, there is blood in the stool, and with cold, there is pus. Dysentery results from the clash of cold and heat in the large intestine; now strangury results from the clash of cold and heat in the small intestine.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

The signs include abdominal distention beneath the navel, urinary tract obstruction, and pain in the genitals, often associated with residual dribbling. </p>
<p>Lao Lin (exhaustion dysuria) results from kidney deficiency and depleted essence, where qi is transmitted to the lower region, leading to dryness in the urinary tract. The kidneys and bladder are interrelated; when the kidneys are deficient and essential fluids are exhausted, the bladder also becomes deficient and unable to control its fluids. Thus, there is frequent urination and dryness in the urinary tract, leading to urinary retention in the urethra, frequent attempts to urinate without success, and pain that connects the small intestine to the urethra.&quot;<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The kidney and bladder are interconnected. Now, if the kidney is deficient and essence is exhausted, then the bladder is also weakened, unable to control its water. Thus, fluids frequently leak out, and when the water pathways are dry, they cannot function smoothly, leading to urine being retained within and causing pain in the connection to the small intestine. </p>
<p>In cases of stone lin, the smaller ones are sand, and the larger ones are stones. It is commonly said that the kidney governs water, and when heat congeals, it transforms into stones. Although this reasoning is close, it fails to understand the essence. Additionally, the kidney consists of two organs: the left is the kidney, and the right is the life gate, which governs water and relates to the essence. The &quot;Shengji Jing&quot; states: the essence refers to the interplay of water and stone. Not knowing the path of water and stone, one does not grasp the profound interplay of generation and transformation. The original essence of Taiyi exists above, signified by water and established upon stone; this is the true substance inherent in the kidney. </p>
<p>For the patient, it is this true essence that transforms, resulting in the emergence of this true substance. The signs are that sand and stones exit through the water pathways, causing obstruction, pain, and distress, hence recovery is rare.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a child suffers from prolapse for a long time and has symptoms such as wind-induced seizures, retracted bow, excessive crying, incoherent speech, or untimely drooling, one should take the Baihui point and apply moxibustion seven times.

<p>For children with prolapsed anal bleeding, every time they go to the toilet, the internal organs may experience unbearable pain; applying moxibustion three times at the Baihui point, located between the crown of the head and the hair swirl is advised.</p>
<p>For children with dysentery characterized by red and white diarrhea, and prolapse occurring in late autumn, one should apply moxibustion once at the point known as the Jieji point, located between the twelfth vertebra and the lumbar region.</p>
<p>There are methods recorded from Huangdi for treating children&#39;s malnutrition and dysentery with prolapse, who are thin and thirsty, and show emaciated features when other doctors have proven ineffective. Moxibustion should be done three inches above the foot’s Yanglingquan point. Qibo states: during the three hot periods, use a bath with peach and willow water for the child, performing moxibustion during the hours of Zi, Wu, or Chou on the same day. Afterwards, wipe with a green silk cloth, as if one can observe the malnutrition worms coming out with the sweat.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: The kind son of a liquor shop, thirteen years old, has suffered from sand and stone dysuria for nine years. Initially, due to the residual poison from a rash, he experienced bloody stools, and some advised him to take Taibai powder, which helped a little. Later, due to accumulated heat not dissipating, he developed a condition called Lin Bi, where every episode caused him to see spirits and scream, alarming the neighbors. A guest named Dai came to Dazhai Temple and inquired about this illness. Dai said: the doctors diagnose it as a kidney and small intestine issue, but that is not correct. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; mentions that the liver meridian can cause disorders related to urination, where blockage refers to inability to urinate, and dysuria signifies dripping. This is the disease of the Wood element, not of the small intestine or kidneys. The Wood element is suppressed, and Fire comes to counter it, hence the heat is in the bladder, tightening the lower jiao, creating sand and stone, similar to a soup kettle that, after prolonged boiling, reduces to lye. Now, if the bladders of sheep and pigs are inflated, they still cannot excrete properly; is it really possible for sand and stone to leak? Thus, one realizes that what was said before about taking five hundred pills leading to this is likely not entirely correct. The &quot;Neijing&quot; says: When Wood is stagnant, it needs to be released. First, use melon stem powder to alleviate it, then follow with the Ba Wu powder mixed with lye, consumed in equal parts; the sand and stones will transform and be expelled.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There was a young boy from the village of the Zhang family, fourteen years old, who had been ill for about a year and a half. He fell ill during the wheat harvest season, suffering from severe pain in his intestines, which caused him to grip his abdomen (as if his blood were blocking), jump around, and cry out without pause. He had not urinated for several months; when he did, it was like sand and stones. His bowel movements were severely constipated, and his anus protruded by one or two inches. Many doctors were unable to cure him. </p>
<p>Upon hearing that a healer was staying at the Zhuge Temple for the summer, the boy’s father carried him there and wept to request help. The healer said, “Today we will treat him, and he will show results today, as it is the appropriate time.” He prepared a mixture to adjust the stomach and promote energy, adding three qian of cowherb root powder, boiling it in river water, and instructing the boy to swallow it three to five times. He also took sixty pills of bitter powder about the size of mustard seeds. By the evening, he experienced a sudden surge of both urination and defecation, releasing pus and blood all at once. Once the purging settled, he was told to drink a large cup of fresh, drawn water, and he was able to urinate well one or two times.</p>
<p>That night, he drank fresh water twenty to thirty times, and his illness improved by ninety percent, stopping his cries once. The next day, he lay exhausted as if drunk, from morning to evening, then suddenly got up and ran, asking for food from his mother, singing and laughing happily, having completely released his suffering. He continued to take Taibai powder and Bazheng powder for a day, and then made a full recovery. Concerned about his health in the hot weather, they stayed for five days before returning. The healer remarked, “This was a problem in the lower burner. If there is no vomiting or purging, how can the lower burner open? If you don’t allow drinking water, how can urination improve? Generally, a clear source leads to a clear flow.”<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

<p>According to the &quot;Childhood Medical Explanations&quot; by the Wan family: In our department, a girl reported that her urine was like blue water and that there were sores forming where it touched her flesh, causing her mother great worry. The physician asked if it might be that the girl’s organs were failing. The response was that the bladder stores the fluids of the five organs, which corresponds to urine. Each type of urine follows the color of the respective organ; the blue color is associated with the liver. The sores that formed were due to the excessive fire of the liver, which burned and caused decay. The physician treated her first with a remedy for red urine, then added a pill of yellow balsam.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Essentials of Medicine&quot; says: The Tang family states: &quot;Liver wind causing head shaking is not recorded in various prescriptions.&quot; Zheng, the official, suffered from head shaking for seven years, with three years of blood in his stools. He had taken over a hundred prescriptions, all aimed at treating the head shaking with wind remedies, while those for stopping the bleeding resulted in either dysentery or intestinal wind, and none of the medicines were effective. After observing his illness and knowing the details, I still could not clarify the root cause. Reflecting on it, I concluded that the liver blood was abundant and was being invaded by external wind-heat. The liver belongs to wood; when it is abundant, the spleen, which is earth, is overpowered by wood, and since the spleen and lungs are like mother and child, both are defeated by the liver, leading to the blood saturating the stool, hence the continuous blood in the stools. Therefore, I prescribed a remedy that primarily reduces the liver, expels wind, and strengthens the spleen. It was initially just a momentary insight, but after a few doses, he was cured. More than ten days later, the bleeding stopped, and he began to pass white pus, and thus he was at peace.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Mirror for Infants&quot; states: A young child had difficulty urinating and responded poorly to Five Ling Powder and similar treatments. The area under his chin and left cheek appeared red, indicating a deficiency of liver and kidney heat. He was treated with Si Wu Decoction plus mountain gardenia, which resulted in recovery. Later, after catching a cold, he was mistakenly treated with sweating methods, and the difficulty in urinating persisted. I then used a tonifying method, specifically the Middle Qi-Invigorating Decoction, adding wheat husk and five-flavor herbs to nourish the spleen and lungs, resulting in improvement.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A small child has difficulty urinating and experiences pain in the shaft, or has blood in the urine, indicating that the kidneys are troubled by heat. First, use Wǔ Lín Sǎn to relieve this, followed by Zī Shèn Wán and Dì Huáng Wán to nourish the liver and kidneys, and gradually, he improves. If the child shows smallpox with a purplish hue, short and red urination, and the area between the chin and right jaw is either red or white, this reflects deficiency of lung and kidney qi alongside heat in the body. Use Bǔ Zhōng Yì Qì Tāng and Liù Wèi Dì Huáng Wán for recovery.</p>
<p>In &quot;Bǎo Yīng Cuò Yào,&quot; it is stated: a child has slight swelling of the eyelids, cough, nausea, and milky white urination. I suspect this is due to spleen dampness from food accumulation, so I use Wǔ Wèi Yì Gōng Sǎn, supplemented with Sì Wèi Féi Ér Wán, leading to recovery. Later, if there is no restraint in diet and vision becomes unclear, I say: the eyes are the essence of the five organs, and if the spleen and stomach are further harmed, nurturing is essential. If not believed, using harsh remedies may lead to a chronic spleen wind, resulting in further stagnation.</p>
<p>A three-year-old child, who has always wet the bed, is examined, revealing a slight redness under both jaws. This indicates a deficiency in the yin of the kidneys and bladder channels. Taking Liù Wèi Wán, the redness slowly diminishes, and bedwetting improves.</p>
<p>A four-year-old child has little appetite, experiences abdominal pain with diarrhea, and has always wet the bed; his forehead and jaw appear dark blue-black, and although it’s hot weather, he detests wind and cold. I say the teachings explain: if it&#39;s hot but not producing heat, there is no fire present. I prescribe Bā Wèi Wán, resolving all symptoms.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p>A child had nodules behind each ear and at the back of the head, white and turbid urine, a pale yellow complexion, fatigue, dry mouth, and irregular bowel movements.

<p>A child who experienced dysentery and rectal prolapse had little appetite, a bluish-yellow complexion, and thought that his spleen and earth element was deficient, which allowed the liver wood to dominate. When he did not believe this, he took an alternative remedy for stagnation and experienced abdominal pain and bloating, along with fatigue and vomiting. I indicated that the spleen qi was severely deficient. When he still did not believe it and continued to take the previous medication, his abdomen became more bloated and heavy, his limbs swollen, and he requested treatment again while wanting to address stagnation. I stated that the heaviness and bloating indicated sinking spleen qi.</p>
<p>Initially, he was given Wuwei Yigong San with added Mu Xiang for four doses. When his hands and feet became cold, four doses of Gan Jiang were added, and gradually his abdominal bloating improved.

<p>Another young child experienced prolapse of the rectum, and a variety of medicines were used to dispel dampness, expel wind, and stop bleeding.

One may use Longliushui (long-running water) to decoct the Bajing San (Eight Corrective Powder) and administer it at intervals until normal urination and defecation resume. If this condition does not arise from heat caused by medicinal treatment, it is easy to remedy; however, if it is due to excessive consumption of heating medicines leading to severe dryness, it becomes not only difficult to treat but may tragically result in death. One may also utilize honey water to mix with Yiyuan San (Enhancement of Vitality Powder) and then administer Tongge Wan (Open Barrier Pill). **Dysuria** For children suffering from sand and stone dysuria as well as five types of painful urination, accompanied by abdominal pain in the navel area, the Yiyuan San serves as the main remedy when mixed with Longliushui for administration. The Bajing San and Shihui San (Stone Rush Powder) may be consumed according to recipe guidelines. All three medicines can be adjusted in dosage. The reason is due to heat in the bladder, which dries up the fluids; hence, the common term \"cold dysuria\" pertains to universal ailments. The Wuling San (Five Dysuria Powder) can be modified by reducing cinnamon and adding Yiyuan San, thus creating the Dan Shen San (Mild Drainage Powder). **Questions from Infants** 【Ming Dynasty, Lu Bosi】"},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"**Inability to Defecate and Urinate** **Discussion:** When treating infants with a febrile condition, if the body is hot and the mind is clouded, leading to a lack of appetite, accompanied by chills, fever, and constipation, with anxiety and excessive sweating, indicating stagnation, fullness, and urgency in the abdomen, and a thin yellow body, enduring high fever day and night, as well as for conditions like wind, heatstroke, convulsions, and kidney disorders, a remedy such as Detoxicating Powder should be administered. One may also take a decoction of Forsythia with Radish and Angelica to treat pediatric convulsions related to accumulated heat and constipation, yielding quick results. Additionally, one can employ the navel-covering method: use a whole green onion without washing off the dirt, a slice of ginger, twenty-one fermented soybeans, and two teaspoons of salt, crush them together, form into a hot cake, and place it over the navel, secured with cotton. After a while, this should help facilitate passage; if not, a different remedy should be used. Inability to urinate can also be addressed this way. **Inability to Defecate** **Discussion:** When a child is constipated, it signifies internal heat in the lungs flowing into the large intestine, causing obstruction. This is due to actual heat and should be treated with a cooling drink, adding Bupleurum if necessary. For significant heat, adding Gardenia and Scutellaria will help relieve it. If there is heat both internally and externally, characterized by a yellowish face, red cheeks, dry lips, and dry mouth, with red and scanty urination and dark yellow feces, with no sweating, one should first release the exterior using Bupleurum to induce sweating. After this, if constipation or abdominal pain persists, one may use cooling drinks, Major Bupleurum Decoction, or Chengqi Decoction to address it. For accumulated heat, Shenqi Pill is particularly effective."},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"**Difficulty in Urination** Tang stated: In the case of children with difficulty in urination, it is due to an imbalance in the heart's meridian, either from hidden heat or from fright. The heart fire rises, which cannot be subdued, causing the kidney water to fail to rise. This leads to an increase in heart heat, and since the small intestine is associated with the heart, difficulty in urination occurs. Mú Tōng Decoction is the primary remedy, with more severe cases treated by the Ba Zheng San. Additionally, for cases with abdominal distension, irritability, and heat, the Zhi Zi Ren San is indicated. For accumulated heat, Shen Qiong Wan is effective. **Enuresis** Chao noted: Enuresis occurs because of cold in the bladder, which cannot control the release of urine. The kidneys govern water, and kidney energy descends to the yin. Urination is merely the excess of water. The bladder serves as the reservoir for fluids; when cold energy weakens, it cannot contain water, leading to enuresis. Yang mentioned: Bedwetting in children is due to cold in the bladder; during the night, which belongs to yin, urination cannot be controlled, and it occurs unconsciously during sleep, and thus the Po Gu Zhi San should be used for treatment. Additionally, a tonic for enhancing intellect should not be omitted."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"**Cloudy Urine** Tang’s commentary states: When a child's urine is cloudy, it is due to irregular breastfeeding, which damages the spleen, preventing the clear and turbid from being distinguished, resulting in urine that resembles rice wash. If this persists, it could lead to consumption. Additionally, there may be hidden heat in the heart and spleen, and it is advisable to clear the spleen, eliminate food stagnation, and relieve the small intestines. Fuling Powder is indicated for this. Sanling Powder and Digestive Pills can also be used. Drinking the Clear Beverage is also acceptable. **Blood in Stool and Toxicity** It is said: If a child has blood in their urine or stool within seven days after birth, this is due to excess heat from the fetal energy. If the mother consumes hot food, alcohol, or roasted items, the heat and toxins enter the heart and lungs, affecting the child in utero and also transferring to the heart and lungs. If the heat enters the heart of the girl, she may have blood in her urine; if it enters the lungs of the boy, it may appear in the stool.

When there is heat in the bladder, fluids dry up internally, obstructing the water pathways, leading to accumulation in the bladder. When the kidney qi is hot, it becomes thick, thus causing the water pathways to be obstructed, resulting in dripping urination, hence it is called dysuria. The condition presents with small amounts of urine that are frequent, along with urgent pain in the lower abdomen that radiates to the navel. There are also stone dysuria, qi dysuria, heat dysuria, blood dysuria, and cold dysuria, each with its specific explanations. The stone dysuria is characterized by the passage of sand and stones.

The condition of painful urination due to heat arises when there is heat qi in the three burners, received in the kidneys and bladder; thus, the heat qi flows into the bladder and causes painful urination. The condition of painful urination with blood is due to excessive heat; in severe cases, it results in blood in the urine, referred to as blood-tinged painful urination. The heart governs blood, and when the heat is severe, the blood disperses and loses its normal channels, seeping into the bladder and resulting in painful urination with blood. In cases of painful urination due to cold, the symptoms begin with chills and shivering, followed by urination. Children may experience excessive cold exposure, affecting the lower burner; the cold qi enters the bladder, where the righteous qi contends with the cold qi.

The answer is: Overindulgence in milk and food disrupts the four bodily humors, and due to a craving for tastes, the internal organs become ill. Sweet and rich food causes dampness and stagnation, leading to blockages in the intestines and stomach. Wind obstructs and burdens the heart and lungs, causing the flow of qi to be unregulated, and water and food cannot move freely without obstructing upward. Thus, they are bound in the lower body. The child, unaware of pain, may not articulate the reasons; they cry out in distress repeatedly, getting angry and swollen but refusing milk. They don't realize the sharp pain that reaches the navel, resulting in a pale or greenish complexion. One should then examine the pulse and breath to treat. If the source of illness is not identified and treatment relies solely on external symptoms using medicine, how can one expect effective results? **Inability to Pass Stool** This is due to the wet nurse or rich foods causing heat accumulation and the six excesses and seven emotions, with afflictive fire being transmitted to the child. One should use remedies to clear the evil and resolve the pent-up condition. If the child is constitutionally weak or has developed desires prematurely, leading to difficult bowel movements with associated pain during urination, one should use tonics for the lungs and kidneys.

When an old man, whose essence is already depleted yet desires intimacy, tries to release his essence, it does not come forth and he internally deteriorates. If essence is exhausted and further depleted, he may experience pain during urination and defecation.

Also, combining five-ingredient powder with fine sand and taking it in salt water on an empty stomach can yield rapid results. Yang obstruction occurs due to extreme heat, leading to dryness and blockage, known as Yang closure. There are also distinctions between retention and dysuria. The \"Neijing\" states that difficulty in the bladder leads to retention, which is due to weak internal organ energy being obstructed by heat, preventing proper flow; it is neither a painful condition nor one associated with excessive volume, but rather a simple blockage without the ability to pass urine. Symptoms include abdominal distension and tightness; for treatment, one can use five-ingredient powder plus plantain and lungwort, or herbal mixtures like Muxiang powder, Jade Dew drink, or Yiyuan powder.

Among these five types, children will have cases only of the three conditions: cold, heat, and qi. The two conditions of labor and stone are caused by extreme weakness. Children, not yet experiencing sexual desire, do not commonly suffer from this, but there may be rare cases of those who are inherently weak in the kidneys, which would be one in a thousand. Below, I will thoroughly describe the symptoms of the five types of strangury. Heat strangury occurs when heat invades the small intestine and bladder. Both pathways control water; water enters the small intestine, transfers to the bladder, travels through the waterway, and is expelled as urine. Therefore, the pathway is for liquid, and the bladder is the repository for fluids. When heat is present, the waterway becomes dry and burnt, causing the flow to be obstructed, resulting in painful, difficulty in urination, hence the name strangury. Symptoms include infrequent urination, and small abdominal pain, connecting the navel to the root of the genitalia. When heat is excessive, there may be blood in the urine, thus also called blood strangury. When blood becomes heated, it disperses, seeps into the membrane, and flows downward with the urine. Cold strangury occurs due to cold and dryness affecting the two pathways. Initial symptoms include chills followed by urination, indicating a struggle between evil energy and righteousness. If the cold energy prevails, chills and tremors occur; if righteousness prevails, the chills subside, and relief is found in urination, but the output is scant and obstructed, with pain in the lower abdomen. If cold is severe, the urine is white and viscous like a thick paste, hence also called viscous strangury. This is similar to dysentery; with heat, there is blood in the stool, and with cold, there is pus.

In cases of stone lin, the smaller ones are sand, and the larger ones are stones. It is commonly said that the kidney governs water, and when heat congeals, it transforms into stones. Although this reasoning is close, it fails to understand the essence. Additionally, the kidney consists of two organs: the left is the kidney, and the right is the life gate, which governs water and relates to the essence. The \"Shengji Jing\" states: the essence refers to the interplay of water and stone.

For children with prolapsed anal bleeding, every time they go to the toilet, the internal organs may experience unbearable pain; applying moxibustion three times at the Baihui point, located between the crown of the head and the hair swirl is advised. For children with dysentery characterized by red and white diarrhea, and prolapse occurring in late autumn, one should apply moxibustion once at the point known as the Jieji point, located between the twelfth vertebra and the lumbar region. There are methods recorded from Huangdi for treating children's malnutrition and dysentery with prolapse, who are thin and thirsty, and show emaciated features when other doctors have proven ineffective. Moxibustion should be done three inches above the foot’s Yanglingquan point. Qibo states: during the three hot periods, use a bath with peach and willow water for the child, performing moxibustion during the hours of Zi, Wu, or Chou on the same day. Afterwards, wipe with a green silk cloth, as if one can observe the malnutrition worms coming out with the sweat. This method is highly effective."},{"anchor":"trans-48p","marker":"48p","type":"translation","text":"**Medical Case** Qian Yi's \"Elementary Principles of Pediatrics\" states: \"For a child suffering from prolapse for half a year, adhering to medicinal treatments that replenish original qi can lead to recovery.\" \"Ai Zhu Weng's Discussions\" mentions: \"A child had a condition of qi lin (urinary difficulty). When Song Ningzong was a prince, he suffered from this illness, experiencing it three hundred times a day and night. The national doctors were at a loss, and someone recommended Sun Lin's treatment. Lin used garlic, light fermented soybean curd, and steamed cakes, which he ground into pills, instructing to take thirty of them with warm water. He stated: 'Today, take two doses, and the illness should decrease by a third; the same goes for tomorrow, and in three days, the illness will be cured.' Eventually, it proved true, and he was rewarded with a thousand strings of cash. When asked about his reasoning, Lin replied: 'Why would a child have lin? It is simply because the water passage is hindered, and these three ingredients can promote unblocking.'\""},{"anchor":"trans-49p","marker":"49p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Rumen Shiqin\" states: The kind son of a liquor shop, thirteen years old, has suffered from sand and stone dysuria for nine years. Initially, due to the residual poison from a rash, he experienced bloody stools, and some advised him to take Taibai powder, which helped a little. Later, due to accumulated heat not dissipating, he developed a condition called Lin Bi, where every episode caused him to see spirits and scream, alarming the neighbors. A guest named Dai came to Dazhai Temple and inquired about this illness. Dai said: the doctors diagnose it as a kidney and small intestine issue, but that is not correct. The \"Lingshu\" mentions that the liver meridian can cause disorders related to urination, where blockage refers to inability to urinate, and dysuria signifies dripping. This is the disease of the Wood element, not of the small intestine or kidneys. The Wood element is suppressed, and Fire comes to counter it, hence the heat is in the bladder, tightening the lower jiao, creating sand and stone, similar to a soup kettle that, after prolonged boiling, reduces to lye. Now, if the bladders of sheep and pigs are inflated, they still cannot excrete properly; is it really possible for sand and stone to leak? Thus, one realizes that what was said before about taking five hundred pills leading to this is likely not entirely correct. The \"Neijing\" says: When Wood is stagnant, it needs to be released. First, use melon stem powder to alleviate it, then follow with the Ba Wu powder mixed with lye, consumed in equal parts; the sand and stones will transform and be expelled."},{"anchor":"trans-50p","marker":"50p","type":"translation","text":"There was a young boy from the village of the Zhang family, fourteen years old, who had been ill for about a year and a half. He fell ill during the wheat harvest season, suffering from severe pain in his intestines, which caused him to grip his abdomen (as if his blood were blocking), jump around, and cry out without pause. He had not urinated for several months; when he did, it was like sand and stones. His bowel movements were severely constipated, and his anus protruded by one or two inches. Many doctors were unable to cure him. Upon hearing that a healer was staying at the Zhuge Temple for the summer, the boy’s father carried him there and wept to request help. The healer said, “Today we will treat him, and he will show results today, as it is the appropriate time.” He prepared a mixture to adjust the stomach and promote energy, adding three qian of cowherb root powder, boiling it in river water, and instructing the boy to swallow it three to five times. He also took sixty pills of bitter powder about the size of mustard seeds. By the evening, he experienced a sudden surge of both urination and defecation, releasing pus and blood all at once. Once the purging settled, he was told to drink a large cup of fresh, drawn water, and he was able to urinate well one or two times. That night, he drank fresh water twenty to thirty times, and his illness improved by ninety percent, stopping his cries once. The next day, he lay exhausted as if drunk, from morning to evening, then suddenly got up and ran, asking for food from his mother, singing and laughing happily, having completely released his suffering. He continued to take Taibai powder and Bazheng powder for a day, and then made a full recovery. Concerned about his health in the hot weather, they stayed for five days before returning. The healer remarked, “This was a problem in the lower burner. If there is no vomiting or purging, how can the lower burner open? If you don’t allow drinking water, how can urination improve? Generally, a clear source leads to a clear flow.”"},{"anchor":"trans-51p","marker":"51p","type":"translation","text":"In Bai Pavilion, the son of Liu Shisan, aged six, suffered from a disease known as sand stone dripping.

According to the \"Childhood Medical Explanations\" by the Wan family: In our department, a girl reported that her urine was like blue water and that there were sores forming where it touched her flesh, causing her mother great worry. The physician asked if it might be that the girl’s organs were failing. The response was that the bladder stores the fluids of the five organs, which corresponds to urine. Each type of urine follows the color of the respective organ; the blue color is associated with the liver. The sores that formed were due to the excessive fire of the liver, which burned and caused decay. The physician treated her first with a remedy for red urine, then added a pill of yellow balsam. After five days of adjustment, she was stable."},{"anchor":"trans-52p","marker":"52p","type":"translation","text":"The \"Essentials of Medicine\" says: The Tang family states: \"Liver wind causing head shaking is not recorded in various prescriptions.\" Zheng, the official, suffered from head shaking for seven years, with three years of blood in his stools. He had taken over a hundred prescriptions, all aimed at treating the head shaking with wind remedies, while those for stopping the bleeding resulted in either dysentery or intestinal wind, and none of the medicines were effective. After observing his illness and knowing the details, I still could not clarify the root cause. Reflecting on it, I concluded that the liver blood was abundant and was being invaded by external wind-heat. The liver belongs to wood; when it is abundant, the spleen, which is earth, is overpowered by wood, and since the spleen and lungs are like mother and child, both are defeated by the liver, leading to the blood saturating the stool, hence the continuous blood in the stools. Therefore, I prescribed a remedy that primarily reduces the liver, expels wind, and strengthens the spleen. It was initially just a momentary insight, but after a few doses, he was cured. More than ten days later, the bleeding stopped, and he began to pass white pus, and thus he was at peace. The \"Treasured Mirror for Infants\" states: A young child had difficulty urinating and responded poorly to Five Ling Powder and similar treatments. The area under his chin and left cheek appeared red, indicating a deficiency of liver and kidney heat. He was treated with Si Wu Decoction plus mountain gardenia, which resulted in recovery. Later, after catching a cold, he was mistakenly treated with sweating methods, and the difficulty in urinating persisted.

If the child shows smallpox with a purplish hue, short and red urination, and the area between the chin and right jaw is either red or white, this reflects deficiency of lung and kidney qi alongside heat in the body.

此因乳母或儿膏粱积热，及六淫七情，郁火传儿为患者，用清邪解郁之剂。禀赋怯弱，早近色欲，大便难而小便牵痛者，用滋补肺肾之剂。《褚氏遗书》云：男子精未满而御女以通其精，则四体有不满之处，异日有难状之疾。老人阴已痿而思色，以降其精，则精不出而内败，精已耗而复竭之，则大小便牵痛如淋。今童子即有此患，益见今人所禀，与古人大径庭矣。人之气血厚薄既殊，而医之用药疗法，又岂可泥执古方而无加减之变乎？"},{"anchor":"orig-11p","marker":"11p","type":"original","text":"小便不通
