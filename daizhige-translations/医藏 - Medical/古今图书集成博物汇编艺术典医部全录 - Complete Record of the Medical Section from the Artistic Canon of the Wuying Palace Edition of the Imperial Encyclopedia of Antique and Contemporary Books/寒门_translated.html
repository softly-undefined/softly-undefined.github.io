<p><strong>Cold Conditions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Verification and Treatment Guidelines</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang]</p>
<p><strong>Moderate Cold</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of moderate cold are characterized by rigidity of the body, inability to speak, trembling of the limbs, chills, occasional warmth, sudden dizziness, and a lack of sweating. These indicate an invasion of cold toxins. How does this differ from an injury due to cold? The answer is: injury due to cold presents with fever, while moderate cold does not produce fever. Zhongjing (a famous physician) elaborated on cold injuries, but moderate cold not generating heat was not fully addressed. Why is this? The explanation is that yang is active while yin is passive; movement leads to change, while stillness leads to stability. Although cold is a yin pathogen, once it is stagnant and turns into heat, it follows the movement of yang, leading to varying changes without a consistent formula. Therefore, it’s essential to carefully analyze the diseases it causes. In the case of not producing heat, the pathogen is trapped within the yin form, stable and unchanging. Since it does not change, it remains confined to the area affected by cold, thereby causing illness, leading to the conclusion that it does not require elaborate discussion.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>To treat it, first use wine to mix with the Su He Xiang pills. If the condition is mild, add five accumulations powder with a bit of Xiang Fu, and for a more severe condition, use ginger attachment decoction. If the person gradually revives, their body warms up, and they can speak slightly, one should ask if there are any other symptoms. If the pulse is cold, slow, and tense, accompanied by a strong and flooding quality causing stabbing pain, use Fu Zi&#39;s regulating middle decoction with half a qian of Mu Xiang. If the condition includes wind and is floating, causing dizziness and numbness, add one qian of Fang Feng; if it involves dampness and is swollen, painful, add one qian of Bai Zhu; if the muscles and tendons are tense, add one qian of Mu Guo; if there is pain in the limbs and joints, add one qian of Gui; it is also advisable to moxibustion the Dan Tian point for better results. Generally, if the issue is in the skin, it is floating; in the flesh, it is harsh, heavy, or pooled liquid. If there is splitting pain, it may be localized to the limbs, or in the chest and sides, or in the shins and back, or in the lower abdomen pulling at the testicles, or the meridians affecting the membranes of the organs may result in pain so severe that a person may not know of their surroundings.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Located in the muscles and bones, this causes cramps and pain in the bones, leading to difficulties in bending and stretching. If it enters the six organs and five viscera, Zhang Zhongjing mentioned this in the &quot;Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber.&quot; When there is cold in the lungs, it results in coughing up turbid phlegm. If there is cold in the liver, the arms cannot be lifted, the tongue is dry, one desires to sigh deeply, and there is pain in the chest that prevents turning to the side, leading to vomiting and sweating. When there is cold in the heart, the person feels as if their heart is gnawed like garlic; in serious cases, heart pain radiates to the back, and back pain penetrates to the heart, akin to being stung by insects, and if the pulse is floating, vomiting brings relief. Not mentioning cold in the spleen and kidneys is a gap in the text. However, what is called the mid-jiao refers to the area enveloping the five organs, where the channels are obstructed, preventing the energy of the organs from entering or exiting, leading to illness. If there were true mid-jiao issues, one would die. The &quot;Eternal Collection of Formulas&quot; states: When there is cold in the liver, the pulse at the Renying (person meeting) and left Guan (revolution) is tight and string-like. The symptoms include aversion to cold with fever, a red face as if sweating, and cramps beneath the chest and flank, with the feet unable to stretch.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>If there is cold in the heart, the pulse at the Renying position is tight and strong at the left inch. The symptoms resemble those of eating raw garlic, and may lead to severe heart pain radiating to the back, aversion to cold, cold extremities, vomiting, and a state of unconsciousness. </p>
<p>If there is cold in the spleen, the pulse at the Renying position is tight and deep at the right Guān position. The symptoms include abdominal distension, spasms in the limbs, and difficulty in expelling gas, as well as constipation or diarrhea due to stagnant qi.</p>
<p>If there is cold in the lungs, the pulse at the Renying position is tight and thin at the right inch. The symptoms are characterized by productive coughing of phlegm, shortness of breath with difficulty in catching one’s breath, and a feeling of cold accompanied by a chilly sweat.</p>
<p>If there is cold in the kidneys, the pulse at the Renying position is tight and slippery at the left Shǐ position. Symptoms may include dark complexion, weak qi, shallow breathing, deafness, lower back pain, knee pain and stiffness, and confusion.</p>
<p>Treatment should be carefully assessed based on severity; for severe cases, Ginger and Attaché Decoction should be the primary remedy. For milder cases, modify Golden Correct Qi Powder with Aconite, or use Five Accumulation Powder with Aconite. </p>
<p>For abdominal pain, cold extremities can be treated with Aconite Internal Regulation Decoction or Ginger Attaché Decoction. For the liver, add papaya; for the lungs, add mulberry bark; for the spleen, add atractylodes; for the heart, add poria.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>On Medical Laws</strong><br><em>By Yu Chang (Qing Dynasty)</em></p>
<p>The six vital energies of wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, and fire divide among the six meridians of the hands and feet; the emergence of all diseases stems from these. This is foundational to the discussions in the &quot;Xuandi&quot; and &quot;Qilian&quot; texts. However, the ancient scriptures from primordial times were transmitted by earlier masters, who borrowed from ancient knowledge. I often ponder about the early days of creation, when knots of cord recorded events—where did writing come from? Was it solely the transformation of celestial sounds giving birth to the world, or did heavenly physicians descend to impart it? Or perhaps, was it sought from the great freedom of heaven? Thus, medicine is the tool bestowed by heaven. To exhaust reason and understand nature to the utmost, one must first prioritize medicine. As time progresses and we move further from antiquity, there appears to be no ladder to ascend. Daily, I read the &quot;Neijing,&quot; and whether its beginnings and ends are manifest or not—what can be sought in what is evident, and what can be sought in what is not? The two fires of rulers and ministers and the dryness have not been deeply considered. Regarding the cold energy, it relies on the earlier sage Zhang Zhongjing’s discussions about external and internal cold from febrile conditions. But how is the theory of internal cold not included in the treasures of &quot;Jinkui&quot;? By the early Jin dynasty, there was little to investigate; even the treatises of his disciple Wei Shen on the three divisions were lost, with no record of any words left by old medical masters or learned practitioners. The shallowness of Jin people regarding medical discussions stands in stark contrast—did we need to question it?<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>If we consider the celestial physicians of the Jin Dynasty, such as Xu Jingyang and Ge Zhichuan, who sought to trace back to the treasures of the Great Freedom of the Purple Mansion on the Dan Platform and understand their original theories, it does not necessarily mean they would be favored in today&#39;s world. While Chang revered the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; he did not underestimate the ordinary and mediocre, secretly wishing to draft commentary on the texts passed down by Zhongjing to glimpse a fragment of the untransmitted knowledge. Later, regarding the concepts of wind, heat, summer dampness, and the deficiencies of dryness and fire from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; he noted the misrepresentation of various ailments, feeling the weight of numerous burdens without rest in old age, and although he did not shy away from hardship, he was also limited by the hearsay he encountered. Thus, he adhered to the principle of following the straightforward path, pondering its ominous implications. Nevertheless, among the many, could there not be a few who understand him? Shouldn&#39;t we take the essence while overlooking minor faults? Those who recognize what is right bring forth profound meanings; those who point out what is wrong propose noteworthy arguments. Ultimately, one cannot simply accept the obscurity of the generations past and must strive for brilliance. With Zhongjing&#39;s exposition of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; in the forefront, and gentlemen’s expositions of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; thereafter, Chang&#39;s role among the later generations resembles that of an actor in a mixed drama, casually touching upon its essentials without claiming to be one of the central figures. Furthermore, having genuinely sought for decades, from waking to sleeping, and having just transcended the ordinary, he must now bear the divine charge; this case still awaits further deliberation.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>On Yin Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Tai Chi moves to generate Yang, and rests to generate Yin. Yang moves ceaselessly, while Yin is still and constant. The interaction of the two energies brings forth life, and their separation leads to death; when the energies are imbalanced, illness arises, and when they are in conflict, the disease deepens. The wise are troubled by this, creating medicine to adjust their imbalance, restoring harmony, so that the people&#39;s lives may be prolonged. Observing the theory of vital energy reaching the heavens, we discuss the Yang energy of the human body, which is like the sun in the sky; when it is misplaced, life is shortened and not revealed. Although this text does not explicitly mention yin diseases, the mechanisms of such diseases can be recognized. In the era of the Three Sovereigns, the springtime ruled with Yang, and Yin remained undisturbed. Therefore, in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; all mentions of yin diseases only hint at their beginnings and do not elaborate further. Later, with the disarray of government, the flourishing Yang transformed into gloomy Yin; the Yang energy of heaven became blocked, while the Yin energy of the earth intruded upon the brightness. This intrusion arises from the murky Yin obscuring the Yang’s brightness. Rivers boil, mountains collapse, high banks become valleys, and deep valleys emerge as hills, as the poems have stated. The people suffer from these conditions, facing untimely deaths in numerous instances, yet few understand the reasons behind such premature endings.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>At the end of the Han dynasty, Zhang Zhongjing wrote the &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; in ten volumes, addressing the treatment of yang illnesses. He also composed the &quot;Treatise on Sudden Diseases&quot; in six volumes, dealing with sudden yin illnesses. The common people suffered greatly, and &quot;Treatise on Sudden Diseases&quot; had already been lost in that era. Was it not that the wise scholars of the time failed to deeply contemplate its meaning, leaving the &quot;Golden Coffer and Jade Box&quot; untouched, while those that circulated among the people were all afflicted by the ravages of war? After Zhongjing, many talented individuals emerged, yet none have elaborated on his outstanding work. Only Han Zhi, adhering to the school of Internal Cold, made some minor innovations, teaching the use of Aconite and Dried Ginger as urgent treatments; he can also be considered a disciple of Zhongjing. However, since the emergence of medicine, only the usual practices have been discussed, while Zhongjing spoke of variations, astonished and brandishing a sword, indicating that it was inevitable. Over the course of hundreds of years, the sayings of the grass and swamp have diverged and seem unlike Zhongjing&#39;s high call. Furthermore, figures like Danxi and Jiezai, among the literati, mostly advocated valuing yin over yang. They posited: yang is abundant, while yin is scarce; yang is often excessive, while yin is always insufficient; yin energy is difficult to complete and easy to deplete, hence the early decline. They devised tonics to replenish yin, which excessively emphasized yin; was this not contrary to the ultimate principle?<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>In this way, regarding the Dao, one follows the example of the gourd, lacking only the single eye; nevertheless, no physician in the world does not revere it as the foundation. Even the &quot;Treatise on Sudden Illness&quot; has been passed down to the present day, comparable to the &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases,&quot; both enduring through time. Alas! As the days extend and peace prevails, there are signs of tranquility; yet in times of chaos and sorrow, death and strife abound. Those who seek to save the times might wrongly prioritize Yin over Yang in governance, leading to a country that is not truly theirs; likewise, those who attempt to treat illnesses by valuing Yin over Yang through medicinal means will inevitably misalign their methods, as such reasoning is not universally applicable. </p>
<p>The emphasis on the doctrine of Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; indicates that for any Yin-related illness, the restoration of Yang should be regarded as urgent. Each case ought to be clearly outlined, and we, having learned this, already know where to begin. Now, I wish to delve into the golden needle and speak on the deeper truths. The Book of Changes states: it connects to the principles of day and night. The day represents Yang, and all Yin entities remain concealed; the night represents Yin, allowing all Yin to manifest, where various spirits feed during the night. All kinds of mountain spirits and water monsters, unleashing mists and flames, create endless tricks, but at the crowing of a rooster, they all promptly hide away. For even though the night is not yet ended with the rooster&#39;s crow, it signifies the arrival of daylight. With the emergence of daylight, the long night will not stretch on forever but will soon approach dawn.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The illness of Yin cannot be categorized by mere appearances; one only sees a glimpse, yet who is the one that illuminates with the burning rhinoceros? The Buddha spoke of four hundred and four diseases, each corresponding to earth, water, fire, and wind, thus all four hundred and four diseases are indeed Yin illnesses. Water, fire, wood, metal, and earth form images in the sky and take shape on the ground; they do not solely belong to Yin. However, the five elements arise attached to the earth; water attaches to the earth and within water is fire, and within fire is wind. Humanity combines these elements to form a body, and the body is influenced by them, thereby causing illness, as they all nourish the four elements. Metal is naturally hard and rigid, resistant to combination; thus, among the four conditions, only metal remains distinct. To achieve non-birth, one must cultivate in the Western Pure Land of the Buddha, which is a necessary path. </p>
<p>People of the world only know that the earth&#39;s energy remains still and undisturbed; when they occasionally witness an earthquake, they are alarmed and consider it unusual. They do not understand that a slight disturbance of the earth can lead to disasters, while a significant quake leads to total ruin. When destruction comes, all things in heaven and earth, all that is tangible, will return to chaos. Nonetheless, when the earth&#39;s energy stirs greatly, and the world does not swiftly perish, it is because the original celestial true martial force sits firmly in the north, subduing the dragons and snakes, preventing them from rising. Therefore, when the earth moves, water does not; when water is still, the fire within it and the wind within the fire also remain undisturbed.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>Zhongjing, regarding the symptoms of excessive yin and the decline of yang, must use Zhenwu Decoction to rescue those in reversal; is it not so? As for the chaos of the dog and pig, it does not mean the heavens and earth are turned upside down and mutually confused. Heaven originally does not mix with earth; rather, it is the earthly qi that combines with heaven and becomes chaotic. Indeed, the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind rotate together, with the might of thunder and cannon firing, countless waves shaking among the five heavens, which, upon impact, causes space to become unified. As for the fleshly body born of parents, in the wake of severe yin illnesses, what then shall be done? The Zen school speaks of towering waves and raging fires, with the destruction of the great cosmos—are these not images of the dissolution of the four elements? Ultimately, the earthly qi that combines with heaven only enhances the desires of the desire realm and form realm, and cannot penetrate into the formless realm.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>In the eight lofty realms, the heavenly palace of Tàolì, the morning assembly of all saints, the inner courtyard of Dōushuài, and all the heavens listening to the teachings—each being has shed the intermediate state, their crowns radiating pure light. From here, they directly enter the realms beyond thoughts and beyond the non-thoughts, stepping into the Buddha&#39;s sphere and the Dharma realm, witnessing the vast universe as if it were a pearl in the palm of the hand. What further karmic circumstances could be added to this? </p>
<p>When karmic circumstances interact with the heavens, they unfold through the hours. As it reaches the hour of the child, the yang energy rises while the yin energy descends, initially showing itself; by the hour of the ox, the yin energy fully returns to the earth, and the void begins to expand, with the dualities establishing their respective places. The sun, moon, and stars shine in the heavens, while the majestic mountains and seas connect to the earth. The quintessence of the heavens spreads amongst the celestial bodies, while the energies of the nine lands converge in the mountains and marshes, bringing clarity and tranquility, vastness and grandeur, so that all beings gradually begin to emerge.</p>
<p>Yet in the gaps of the heavenly realm, the remaining violent and turbid shadows, extending infinitely, rush through the skies and fall, destroying whatever is born, leaving no remnant. After the heavens opened and the earth was separated, the remaining dark remnants still pose a threat; they must eventually return to chaos, leading to a harmonious balance. The light of the heavens shines down to aid, and the virtues of the earth rise above, with splendid trees and flowers heavily bearing fruit. The heavenly beings partake of their offerings, no longer rising higher, thus allowing life to be bestowed, culminating in the flourishing three realms of heaven, earth, and humanity. </p>
<p>This principle relates profoundly to human life and death, the conditions of health and danger, and is immensely significant. Confucians may set it aside for discussion and debate; physicians may even disregard it further.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Chang often encounters patients with disorders caused by yin evils, manifesting as chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, spontaneous sweating, muscle tremors, and similar symptoms. He promptly closes the gate and employs the True Warrior method, which is unsuitable for great movements of dragon and thunder in the upper heavens. He follows the secret teachings passed down from Zhongjing, ensuring the individual finds peace. If this treatment is neglected, soon the turbid yin will rise from the chest, causing throat swelling and pain, a swollen tongue, and bulging eyes. If the turbid yin rises from the back, it leads to thick neck muscles, ice-cold head and neck, and the body becomes mottled blue and purple, leading to death. Could this not be seen as the earthly energy overwhelmed by heavenly calamities? </p>
<p>The key is to promptly administer the pure yang herbs, such as Fuzi and Ganjiang, to expel the yin evils downward through the yin orifices, which aligns with the concept of quickly sweeping away the turbid yin energy, returning to a state of balance on the earthly plane. It is crucial to thoroughly expel all the yin lingering in the yang spaces, leaving none behind, to ensure effective recovery, separate from merely sweeping away the lingering atmospheric influences of the heavens, which fails to restore the balance. </p>
<p>By adhering to the principles found in Zhongjing&#39;s writings and applying them over thirty years to treat hundreds of individuals, every instance where the right medicine was applied resulted in full recovery. Even if this appears to be a temporary remedy, it can be regarded as the proper and regular method. The medical field lacking this is truly missing an essential principle. I humbly present this perspective to initiate discussion.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>There are subsequent authors who draw upon the vast and subtle essence. This compilation may contain elements worth noting. </p>
<p>In cases of cold attacking the interior, there is a predominance of yin and a deficiency of yang, representing the most dangerous and urgent condition. The classics state: &quot;Yin excess generates internal cold.&quot; This results in the counterflow of qi, leading to accumulated cold within the chest that fails to disperse. If it does not disperse, warmth departs and cold remains. The presence of cold leads to blood stagnation, causing the pulse to be blocked; thus, the pulse becomes full and firm, indicating internal cold. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; speaks of this.</p>
<p>Now, I seek to reconcile Zhang Zhongjing’s interpretations with the essence of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and elaborate a bit, daring to extend my discourse. The classics mention that an excess of yin generates internal cold, and also speak of external cold affecting the interior; could this not imply that internal cold comes first, followed by external cold affecting the interior? The classics also say that blood stagnates and the pulse is obstructed; does this not indicate that an excess of external cold causes a strong pulse, while blood stasis leads to a coarse pulse? Within this lies a significant doubt, and I wish to clarify: first, in the human body, the protective yang is the most solid. The Taiyang guards the back, the Yangming guards the front, and the Shaoyang protects the sides. Now, if one moves directly through the three yang channels to reach the Shaoyin, is this not akin to descending from the heavens? It is understood that the counterflow of qi accumulates within the chest, causing stomach cold; when the stomach is cold, one consumes cold foods and inhales cold air, all of which can enter the stomach.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The kidney is the gateway of the stomach. When external cold directly invades the lesser yin kidney, it is referred to as &quot;middle cold.&quot; This is something that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; hints at but does not explicitly state. One point is that its pulse is large and strong; although it is called &quot;middle cold,&quot; it does not indicate a complete disease. In cases of sudden disease caused by middle cold, the pulse must be weak. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; comprehensively discusses the pulse patterns of cold due to invasion, hence it mentions the larger and vigorous pulse. Zhongjing categorizes cold damage as a heat disease and middle cold as a cold disease, explaining them separately. The pulse of cold damage generally features a large, floating, rapid, and slippery quality as yang, while a sinking, thick, weak, and subtle quality represents yin. If a yang pulse appears in a yang disease, it is indicative of death; consequently, in a sudden acute yin disease, there should be no return of a yang pulse. If it is merely large and vigorous, with two yang and one yin, why would there be sudden urgency? This is also something that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; hints at but is difficult to discern.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Zhongjing describes sinking, thick, weak, and subtle pulses as yin, if cold damage transmits into the lesser yin channel, it is said that the pulse is weak and subtle. Now, in middle cold of the lesser yin, it must only refer to the weak pulse, not the subtle one. This is because &quot;weak&quot; pertains to the subtlety of yang, while &quot;subtle&quot; pertains to the delicateness of yin.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>When cold邪 affects the kidneys, the loss of yang and perhaps the loss of yin cannot be determined yet. When it reaches a state of extreme cold, there is only the loss of yang without the loss of yin; therefore, the pulse must not be thin. If a thin pulse is indeed felt, it indicates that the yin has already been depleted internally—how could it then recover? </p>
<p>In the case of cold damage, only the lesser yin has a faint pulse, while other channels do not. The bladder of the greater yang is the organ of the lesser yin, and when a faint pulse is felt, there is aversion to cold. Thus, Zhongjing originally treated the lesser yin using aconite and ginger. The faint pulse and aversion to cold signify the approach of true yang is slight. </p>
<p>As the poem states: &quot;That moon is faint, and this sun is faint; now these lowly people, too, grieve in sorrow.&quot; In the heavenly phenomena, yang cannot be weak; thus, can the yang within the human body be weak? With yin in the kidneys being abundant and yang being slight, cold is naturally generated from within, compounded by external cold cutting directly through. It may either bury yang within, leading to disaster, or push yang outward, causing one to be overwhelmed, often resulting in sudden death—hence, Zhongjing considered it a sudden illness. </p>
<p>The physical body of a person is entirely yin. When the parents conceive, a single point of true yang is born first and stored within the two kidneys, from which the essence of life is generated, thus referred to as the source of vitality.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>Outside the six excesses, no evil dares to invade; thus, they are called the guardians against temptation. In a dark room, a single lamp shines brightly until dawn; the eyes and ears rely on it for clarity, the hands and feet depend on it for action. In ancient times, people braved the snow and cold, seeking poetry and friends, yet they still spoke of a fleeting moment of inspiration. As for achieving merit in distant lands or enduring hardships like biting cold, how often does one forget internal cold while facing external cold? Therefore, by cultivating the innate with the acquired, one can enjoy it for a hundred years. If not, the slightest yang will surely lead to an excess of yin, and as yin increases, yang will further decrease. If the outer cold suddenly arrives, and one relies on habitual methods for treatment, what are the chances that one in a hundred will survive? Is the essence of illness contained within this? The true yang in the kidneys is supported by water, remaining attached and unseparated; it is confined by earth, hiding and not revealing. Aside from release and drainage, it remains steadfast and unmoving. The yang of the hands and feet is employed to move throughout the body, protecting the pores and guarding the exterior; the yang in the spleen mirrors the strength of heaven, digesting food, distributing fluids, and operating internally; the yang in the chest reflects the regulation of the sun, illuminating the sky above, dissipating yin and removing gloom, proclaiming it upwards.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>These three elements represent abundance and prosperity; the true yang in the kidneys enjoys tranquility and peace, hence it is possible for an eighty-year-old to father a child, and those with remaining vigor can still engage in commerce. Even if one indulges excessively, leading to impotence and lack of use, one can still prolong the years. The crucial issue lies in the external and internal yang: when it weakens and becomes unresponsive, the yin energy begins to take precedence. If the skin is cold and lacks warmth, it may lead to stiff muscles; the external yang is no longer functional. If digestion fails, one may experience nausea, diarrhea, and bloating; the internal yang of the spleen is not working. If there is obstruction in the chest, it can result in blockage and tightness; the yang within the chest is not functioning. Then, one may resort to the yang sealed by water and earth, taking on responsibilities, and while the head receives some yang and turns red, the skin may suffer damage and dryness, and the spleen and stomach may obtain yang but not be free from cold; how can one endure long? </p>
<p>In the presence of cold and a slight yin, strict measures must be taken to eliminate the faint yang, leading to skin that is frozen and cold, devoid of sweat and spirit. It is urgent to use Aconite and dried ginger along with scallions to disperse the cold, and add pig bile to direct it into the yin. However, if there is concern that the medicinal power may not suffice, one should apply hot scallions and moxa to attack both externally and internally, which is essential to break the hard obstruction. One must take a moment to pause; otherwise, it will be too late. This is a difficult situation.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>If a person’s true yang energy is weak and their pores are naturally open, with yin being excessive internally, it will inevitably cause their yang to diminish externally, resulting in profuse sweating and a stiff neck and spine. Using aconite, ginger, and pig bile is essential, but do not add scallions or apply heat, as this might aid dispersion, making the qi exit with the sweat, leaving no way for yang to return from within. It is necessary to stop the sweating, sharply administer the aforementioned medicines, and continuously reinforce the protection of the pores. Otherwise, there is a risk that the yang may be further depleted. This is a challenging situation.</p>
<p>Using aconite and ginger to counteract yin and restore yang is akin to cavalry breaking through a siege, raising flags to rally the scattered yang, thereby facilitating its reunion. Those who do not understand this principle will increase the dosage of medicines and mix them into a decoction, inadvertently restraining the force that should penetrate, making the effort slow and ineffective. This poses another difficulty.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the initial medicines, one must prioritize adding angelica and cinnamon to address the vitality. Since cold pathogens invade, they first damage the blood of the vital organs. Otherwise, if the medicines focus solely on defending the exterior, without benefiting the interior, they will not be appropriate for the ailment, and the pathogen will not be entirely eliminated, leading to a lack of favorable outcome. This constitutes a fourth difficulty.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>Moreover, one must include ginseng and licorice in the initial medicine to adjust the essence and nourish the body, achieving the desired effects. Otherwise, the fierceness of ginger and aconite will provoke conflicts with the superior. This is the fifth difficulty.</p>
<p>After taking two or three doses of the initial medicine, one may feel the yang aspect within themselves, experience light movements, and have a spirited demeanor. Further, it is essential to add astragalus, white atractylodes, five-flavored fruit, and white peony to equally supplement both yin and yang without pause. The heaviness of yin may show a sign of decline, like a prodigal son returning home; at this moment, if one is unsteady and neglects the necessary follow-up, they will surely squander previous accomplishments. This is the sixth difficulty.</p>
<p>By using a combination of medicines to cultivate yin and protect yang, it is understood that the person may already possess heat-phlegm, and yang has long transformed into cold from yin. At this point, although the intangible yin cold may be dispersed, the tangible cold phlegm blocking the passages cannot abruptly convert to heat. Therefore, while ginger and aconite can be omitted, all cold and cooling components like ox gall and bamboo mucus must not be used. If one carelessly employs cold remedies due to existing heat-phlegm, yin will again become involved, leading to turmoil in yang, which will surely waste prior efforts. This is the seventh difficulty.</p>
<p>After using the supplements to balance and nourish, it indicates an intention to cease military actions and promote cultural pursuits.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>From now on, there will always be stubborn phlegm accumulating in the meridians; therefore, one should adopt a mild and cold approach to assist the qi in opening up, and avoid spicy and hot substances that can cause blockage. Spicy foods are often used as a last resort; once the Yang is stabilized, one should nurture the Yin. How can one seek to achieve results through effort, only to let the disease persist while the medicine remains, thus giving rise to other ailments, leaving no peace? This is one of the eight difficulties.</p>
<p>I briefly outline the disease concepts and clearly state the eight difficulties. A skilled practitioner must exert effort; this way, the method may become clear and actionable. However, the unrefined and rigid practitioners will surely not succeed; ignorant individuals who are poorly informed will inevitably be filled with doubts and fears about taking medicine. Let us diligently adhere to the theories of Yin diseases, and kindly seek clarification from wise philosophers, praying that we may mutually elucidate, allowing the true essence of curing diseases to be expressed openly and freely, which would be a great blessing for the people!</p>
<p>Danxi stated: Those who are suffering from internal cold have suddenly been exposed to cold, and their illnesses arise violently. People with internal cold, due to their pores being relaxed, receive evil influences all over their body. It becomes difficult to differentiate along the meridians, and there is no heat to disperse; they must be treated with warming and tonifying remedies. If the Stomach is greatly deficient and not treated promptly, recovery will be significantly delayed. The method should be to use warm dispersing soups; in severe cases, add prepared Aconite. This understanding surpasses the ordinary.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>It is said: If one is afflicted by the cold air from heaven and earth, and consumes cold foods that injure the mouth, experiencing external sensations without internal injuries, one should use the methods of Zhang Zhongjing. If there are internal injuries accompanied by this condition, one should add dispersing herbs to the Ba Zhen Decoction, starting with ginseng and astragalus to support the righteous qi. This shows that Danxi follows Dongyuan but is not yet aware of the wealth and beauty of Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s teachings.</p>
<p>Dai Yuanli states: &quot;Middle cold&quot; refers to the body receiving the chill of autumn, eating ice water, melons, and cold items. When the patient presents with a deep, fine pulse, cold hands and feet, weak breath, and fatigue, even if their body feels hot, they do not thirst and may speak weakly. If they encounter a heat disease and mistakenly take cold medicines, the consequences can be severe, even leading to death. In cases with a rapid pulse or those who drink water frequently and feel restless, they are signs of heat disease. Cold and heat are like water and fire; they cannot be treated the same way, as this can be deadly, so one must be cautious!</p>
<p>Note that Yuanli is an esteemed physician of the current dynasty. Regarding middle cold, he has grasped the broad concept but has not understood the deeper principles. He incorrectly states that treating it as a heat disease will lead to death, which is a significant misunderstanding of the principle of treatment. Other two experts do not mention middle cold, thus their contributions are deemed worthwhile. </p>
<p>Three laws are observed.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>When treating illnesses caused by cold and excessive conditions, those who excessively use cool and clear medicines have a survival rate of one in a hundred; those who die in such circumstances are killed by the physician. In treating violent cold illnesses, if the true nature is unclear within the chest, although spicy and warm medicine may be employed, whether gradually introduced or monitored closely, if the time is not right, the condition can suddenly worsen and result in death, which is the physician&#39;s fault. For every yin disease that a physician can remedy, one calamity can be avoided, as it aligns with the laws of heaven and humanity. If one cannot resolve sudden illness but seeks to escape calamity, it is unattainable. In the world, there are many fortunate individuals; how should they choose their methods?</p>
<p>The Six Indications of Color and Pulses:</p>
<p>A color of coldness must manifest as blue, for blue is associated with the liver. Therefore, Zhongjing said: if the tip of the nose is blue and there is pain in the abdomen, one with severe cold will die. This refers to the Shao Yin coexisting with the cold of the kidney water; extreme cold leads to the loss of yang, and the loss of yang leads to death. If the lips and mouth are blue and the body cold, it indicates imminent death. The five organs belong to yin, which store essences and house spirits. When blood and qi are obstructed by cold evils, the genuine essence of the organs cannot circulate, leading to the loss of spiritual function, blocking the paths of rising and falling, entry and exit, with the absence of nourishment causing the lips and mouth to appear blue. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: if the foot&#39;s Jue Yin energy ceases, the lips turn blue. The liver stores blood, so when qi is obstructed, it is evident that nourishment is cut off. If the pulse is absent, it indicates imminent death; if the pulse returns, one recovers. Absent means gone.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>The meridians are the conduits of the organs. When pressured by cold, the vital energy escapes from the meridians, leading to death if it enters the internal organs, but healing occurs if it enters the internal cavities. The text states: when blood and vital energy flow together upward, it results in sudden death by great collapse. The &quot;upward&quot; refers to the middle jiao, which is a cavity, and does not fully point to the internal organs. Similarly, if an evil influence obstructs the five collaterals, resembling a state of death, treatment involves restoring the circulation of blood in the meridians. This pertains mainly to the channels in the head and face; restoring the circulation of blood there results in healing and does not solely imply the internal cavities. Thus, the escape of the meridian&#39;s energy into the organs or cavities indicates certain signs. The obstruction of blood and energy in the upper part indicates symptoms of disease. Careful examination and consideration of these factors will clarify life or death outcomes.</p>
<p>If the middle cold causes the pulse to disperse, it results in death. Indeed, if the energy escapes inward, it disperses outward. The inward escape still distinguishes between the organs, while the outward escape results in a complete loss of Yang and cannot be regained. </p>
<p>When the pulse at the wrist is slow, stagnant, and fine, it signifies cold in the lower jiao. If the vital energy is warmed and the cold dispelled, the person may recover.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Treatment of Cold Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Cold diseases may originate externally or internally. Externally, they may arise from wind and cold injuring the body or from cold foods harming the organs. Internally, they may result from fatigue damaging the yang or from a weak constitution. If cold enters from the outside, it usually progresses from superficial to deep, often causing symptoms such as nausea, bloating, or abdominal pain and diarrhea. When cold originates internally, it affects the organs and manifests at the surface, leading to chills, aversion to cold, or symptoms of reversal and spasm. In summary, heat is often associated with excess, while cold is frequently linked to deficiency. Therefore, in treating cold syndromes, one must consider both the deficiency and the condition of the organs; this is not an easy principle to adhere to. Cold toxins that directly affect the three yin channels correspond to what is known in the category of cold damage as direct involvement with the yin channels.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>If one is suddenly exposed to cold, resulting in coldness and shivering of the body, stiffness in the limbs, pain in the heart and abdomen, inability to speak or loss of voice, confusion and faintness, vomiting and curling up, with a pulse that is weak, fine, or deep and tight without vitality, these are all symptoms. One must not recklessly use wind-dispersing medicines, as this will further disperse the vital energy. Instead, it is crucial to warm the interior, allowing the cold evil to disperse on its own. For mild cases, use the <strong>Liqin Decoction</strong> or <strong>Warm Stomach Drink</strong>; for severe cases, resort to <strong>Four Reverse Decoction</strong>, <strong>Great Warm Interior Drink</strong>, or similar formulations like <strong>Aconite to Regulate Yin Decoction</strong>. </p>
<p>In cases that are critical, where the lips turn blue and the body contracts with no pulse, use the <strong>Hua Tuo Rescue Yang Decoction</strong> for immediate rescue, or perform moxibustion on the <strong>Qihai</strong> and <strong>Guanyuan</strong> points for 20 to 30 times. If the hands and feet gradually warm up and the pulse is weak but detectable, life can be saved.</p>
<p>One method: grind pepper into powder, soak it in boiling wine, and consume it; externally, apply scallion and salt compresses. </p>
<p>Another method: take two portions of black beans, fry them until cooked, then boil with wine until it reaches a rolling boil, remove the beans, and drink two bowls of the wine. This will lead to recovery. </p>
<p>For cold in the Taiyin channel, if there is pain in the middle abdomen, use <strong>Liqin Decoction</strong> or <strong>Warm Stomach Drink</strong>.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>In the presence of cold with lesser yin, there will be pain in the abdomen; it is advisable to use Guiqi Decoction or add Wuyuyu to Wujisan. In the presence of cold with extreme yin, there will be pain in the lower abdomen; it is advisable to use Si Ni Decoction, Guiqi Decoction, or Warm Liver Decoction. If there is a cold stagnation with the three yin, leading to severe distension and pain, it is recommended to temporarily use a Gas-Expelling Decoction or Han’s Warm Center Decoction to first disperse the stagnation, then support and nourish. Alternatively, Wuwei Chenfu Decoction or Warm Liver Decoction can also be chosen. Internal injury from consuming cold foods leads to excessive cold in the organs, which may cause pain, vomiting, or diarrhea, and the treatment should follow the respective symptoms. For those with a congenital deficiency of yang in the organs, who often rely on strength and prefer eating cold foods and drinking cold teas that convert yang into yin, the treatment is the same as mentioned above.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The inherent constitution is weak, often characterized by excess yin and depleted yang; this indicates insufficient prenatal yang. Alternatively, excessive depletion can lead to a decline in the fire of the life gate, representing a loss of postnatal yang. Symptoms may include an initially cold sensation followed by chills, coldness in the hands and feet, shivering of the body, weak spleen and stomach, distended abdomen, frequent small urination, weakened yang functions, excessive fear and anxiety, or reduced vitality in the eyes and ears—these all signify yang deficiency leading to cold. The treatment should focus on warming and supplementing the original qi. For mild cases, it is advisable to use formulas such as Five Gentlemen Decoction, Regulating Yin Decoction, Six Qi Decoction, Warm Stomach Drink, and Longevity Spleen Decoction; choose from these as appropriate. For severe cases, major tonifying formulas such as Great Tonifying Original Decoction, Right Returning Drink, Right Returning Pill, Four-Flavored Returning Yang Drink, Six-Flavored Returning Yang Drink, and Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Pill should be employed. </p>

<p>Medical Case</p>
<p>The &quot;Treasure of Health&quot; states: In the sixth month of the year Jisi, I was residing in the summer at Shangdu. A certain officer, Dong Yancheng, aged over forty, due to excessive labor, experienced incessant thirst and drank excessively of cold milk, which led to diarrhea, intestinal rumbling, and abdominal pain. His limbs were cold, he had cold sweats, and his breath was also cold. The six pulses were like spider silk, and he occasionally felt faint. The other doctors proposed to apply scallion on the abdomen and prescribed Wuxi Decoction with five taels, twenty slices of raw ginger, and nine sections of scallion greens, boiled with three sheng of water until reduced to one sheng, then strained and cooled before drinking. By midnight, his body felt warm, and he craved porridge, and by dawn, he had recovered. </p>
<p>Yujizhen Zang stated: The pulse is thin, the skin is cold, the qi is depleted, leading to diarrhea and lack of appetite. This condition is known as the five depletions. If gruel enters the stomach, the depleted energy revives. Truly! Master Lu Zhai remarked: Illness has various degrees of severity, prescriptions have variances in size, and treatment has varying urgency. The condition of the officer cannot be cured unless a significant prescription is utilized for urgent treatment. The &quot;Essence of Truth&quot; also states: To nourish the lower body, treat with urgency; when urgency strikes, the flavors must be rich—this is the essence of it.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Zhendingsi Wudeqing, aged 46, in the third month of the Bingzi year during the Yuan dynasty, fell ill due to worry and overwork, leading to irregular eating and drinking. His body was cold, his mouth and nose were also cold, and he had a cool sweat on his forehead. At times, he felt dizzy, and his pulse was faint like spider silk. One physician diagnosed him with a wind condition and wanted to use the Xuanfeng Powder to dispel it. I recalled the discussion on the creation of Xuanfeng Powder for children by the Qian family, noting that internal damage to the spleen and stomach in children could lead to either vomiting or diarrhea, and if prolonged, the wind pathogen could become lodged in the stomach, causing diarrhea. There are knots within the powder, leading to concern over lingering shock, thus the Xuanfeng Powder was used to guide out the wind pathogen. The Inner Canon states: &quot;Prolonged wind causes food poisoning,&quot; which is exactly what this refers to. Now, the condition of Deqing indicates an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; a bitter cold medicine is not appropriate. The Inner Canon also says: &quot;Excessive yin leads to profuse sweating and cold body.&quot;<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br>The &quot;Theory of Yin and Yang Correspondences&quot; states: When Yin is strong, the body feels cold with sweat, and the body remains clear. If one shivers, they feel cold; if cold persists, it leads to fainting. The &quot;Regulation of the Channels&quot; also says: Excessive Yin produces internal cold. Qibo explained: The energy of fainting rises and the cold accumulates in the chest without being expelled. If it is not expelled, warm energy departs, leaving only cold, thus resulting in internal cold. Dongyuan commented: This is due to insufficient spleen and stomach, overexertion of the body, and the central Qi being affected by illness, leading to cold accumulation. Therefore, it is necessary to tonify Yang. Thus, I prescribed a modified formula of Lichong Decoction with black Aconite, taking five qian each time, and commonly using scallion white to stew mutton soup, taking the clear broth in a large cup at the prescribed times. By evening, the limbs gradually warmed and there was slight sweating. I repeated it late at night. The following day, one&#39;s spirit revived, and the pulses were strong. After several doses, it was cured. I recall Li Sishun saying: The symptom is the evidence; the disease manifests internally, while the symptoms appear externally. Any physician who does not consult the &quot;Nèijīng,&quot; does not seek the source of the illness, arbitrarily interprets the symptoms, and rigidly follows formulas is deviating from the fundamentals, which can lead to many mistakes. It is important to reflect carefully on this!<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>Minister Shen, aged sixty-two, had a pre-existing condition of stomach deficiency. In the summer of the year of the Earth Serpent (己巳), he was residing in the capital when, in June, there was an incessant heavy rain. Due to excessive labor from public duties, his eating and drinking were irregular, causing daily abdominal pain, and he often had to relieve himself, feeling only slight relief afterward. He had no appetite, was disinclined to speak, and felt fatigued. He called for me to treat him. I examined his pulse, which was deep, slow, and slightly taut. Given Minister Shen&#39;s advanced age and weakened vitality, along with his longstanding cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach, compounded by the incessant rain, excessive labor, and irregular eating, his middle Qi was severely deficient. The &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states: excessive eating and fatigue injure the spleen. If there is deficiency, it may lead to excess. If the year&#39;s fire is insufficient, cold prevails greatly, resulting in the people suffering from diarrhea.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>Currently, the spleen and stomach vital energy is insufficient, and the kidney water must intertwine with the wood element, thereby offending the earth. Such a condition cannot be withstood by the weak and is a consequence of being overpowered. This illness cannot be treated with sweet, pungent, and very warm herbs; otherwise, it cannot drain water or nourish the earth. Even in the midst of summer heat, there are warnings against excess heat; it is said that those who are already afflicted should be treated according to the situation in order to address urgent matters. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Cold that infiltrates internally should be treated with pungent and warm substances. Dried ginger and aconite are used due to their pungent, bitter, and very warm properties to drain cold water; they serve as the main ingredients. For those with spleen deficiency, nourishment should be sweet, utilizing ginseng, white atractylodes, licorice, and dried mandarin peel, which are bitter and sweet with warm properties to supplement the spleen and earth. When the stomach is cold, leading to loss of appetite, fresh ginger and cardamom, which are pungent and warm, can alleviate cold that attacks the stomach. Magnolia bark is pungent and warm, benefiting the intestines and stomach. White poria is sweet and neutral, aiding ginger and aconite in guiding out cold dampness. White peony root is slightly cold and sour, supplementing metal and draining wood, helping to prevent heat from damaging lung Qi. If taken multiple times, the effect will be evident.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: The Grand Marshal Wang Jun had severe vomiting and abdominal retention, with intense pain around the navel, and coldness in his hands and feet, with a faint and thin pulse.

A dose of Shenfu Decoction was administered, leading to immediate recovery.</p>
<p>Chen Huku&#39;s mother had long suffered from abdominal pain, which was accompanied by chest fullness and vomiting, with cold extremities, flushed face, numb lips, dry throat, and a fluctuating pulse. Others treated her for phlegm-fire, but her symptoms repeatedly recurred. In the spring of the year of Yisi, she suddenly experienced severe heat and restlessness, and medication only worsened her condition. Zhu Cunmo suggested that this was caused by taking cold and cooling medicines and wanted to use ginseng and poria. Doubting the efficacy of pain-relief methods, he then sought my help. Upon diagnosis, I sighed and said: This is due to cold and cooling harming the true essence, resulting in internal true cold while appearing to have outward false heat. Furthermore, the pulse was string-like and large with unusual characteristics, indicating a deficiency of spleen energy, with the liver meridian overpowering it. The only solution was to warm and nourish the stomach. Therefore, I prescribed a mixture of Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, with added Banxia, Fulian, Wuzhuyu, and Muxiang. One dose led her to a deep sleep throughout the night, the large pulse then subdued, the strange pulse disappeared, and her symptoms were relieved.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>A Confucian scholar suffered from poor digestion and external exposure to wind and cold, resulting in headaches, fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. He was treated with a decoction of ginseng to nourish the stomach, supplemented with herbs like chuanxiong, angelica, and others, which alleviated all symptoms. The next day, however, he experienced severe abdominal pain. He found that pressing his abdomen eased the pain, indicating a deficiency in the spleen with cold invading, leading to internal deficiency and a false exterior heat. He was given a modified version of Xiangsha Liujunzi Decoction with additional herbs, which reduced the pain significantly. After adjusting the prescription, he was cured within an hour.</p>
<p>Wang from the local school had a generally weak vitality, and after two years of exhausting examinations during the bingwu and dingwei years, his health deteriorated by December. He exhibited a high fever, excessive tearing that caused congestion, redness in his eyes, a darkened face, a heavy breath almost on the verge of collapse, a rapid and strong pulse found to be almost absent upon examination, and a dry tongue feeling like a stab, indicating true internal cold and false external heat. He then took a tonic famously known as the Ten Complete Tonics. I suggested that after taking this formula, his pulse should gradually stabilize. Soon he fell into a deep sleep, but upon awakening, he felt even colder and noticed his pulse had become thin like a thread, marking true internal cold. I then gave him an ounce of ginseng combined with three qian of cooked aconite, which he took to recover. That night his pulse dropped again, so I adjusted the dosage to two ounces of ginseng and five qian of cooked aconite, which helped him recover once more. Later, he was stabilized with larger doses of ginseng, atractylodes, rhemannia, and fried licorice for further treatment.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>In the summer months, when people like Xu Min stay indoors, they consume cold fruits and dishes and suffer from abdominal pain. I said: This is a symptom of internal cold; it is necessary to use Fuzi Lichong Decoction to revive Yang. If you do not believe it and instead use formulas like Erchen Decoction, Zhishi, Huanglian, or Xiangru, you will die.</p>
<p>Young Zongbo Gu Dongjiang stopped eating due to dysentery, experiencing abdominal pain and a sensation of heaviness. Some used laxatives, resulting in swelling of the legs, decreased appetite, fatigue, thirst from heat, and a pulse that was rapid and strong, yet subtle upon palpation. I administered Liu Junzi Decoction with ginger and cinnamon, each one qian, and Wu Zhuyu and Wuweizi, each one qian, boiled and cooled, for him to consume before sleep. Upon waking, all symptoms had significantly receded, and another dose brought about tranquility. This is true internal cold with false external heat; treat it with warming medicines while providing cold drinks. Mr. Dongyuan treated symptoms of false cold and heat by administering false cold and heat remedies, which is precisely what this refers to.</p>
<p>The jinshi Liu Huafu consumed cold fruits in the summer, suffering from abdominal pain and diarrhea. I used Fuzi Lichong Decoction, and he became stable after just one dose.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　中寒之证，身体强直，口噤不语，或四肢颤掉，或洒洒恶寒，或翕翕发热，或卒然眩运，身无汗者，此寒毒所中也。其异于伤寒何也？曰：伤寒发热，而中寒不发热也。仲景于伤寒详之，而中寒不成热者，未之及，何也？曰：阳动阴静，动则变生，静则不变。寒虽阴邪，既郁而成热，遂从乎阳动，传变不一，靡有定方，故极推其所之之病，不得不详。其不成热者，则是邪中于阴形之中，一定而不移，不移则不变，不变则止在所中寒处而生病，是故略而不必详也。<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>治之，先用酒调苏合香丸，轻则五积散加香附一钱、麝香少许，重则用姜附汤。若人渐苏，身体回暖，稍能言语，须臾，问其别有何证。寒脉迟紧，挟气带洪，攻刺作痛，附子理中汤加木香半钱。挟风带浮，眩运不仁，加防风一钱；挟湿带濡，肿满疼痛，加白朮一钱；筋脉牵急，加木瓜一钱；肢节疼痛，加桂一钱，亦可灸丹田穴，以多为妙。大抵中在皮肤则为浮，中在肉则为苛、为重、为聚液。分裂而痛，或痛在四肢，或痛在胸胁，或痛在胫背，或痛在小腹引睪，或经脉引注脏腑之膜，原为心腹痛，或注连于脏腑，则痛死不知人。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>中于筋骨，为筋挛骨痛，屈伸不利。中入六腑五脏，则仲景述在《金匮要略》中。所以肺中寒者，吐浊涕。肝中寒者，两臂不能举，舌本燥，喜太息，胸中痛而不得转侧，则吐而汗出也。心中寒者，其人苦心如啖蒜状，剧者，心痛彻背，背痛彻心，譬如虫注，其脉浮者，自吐乃愈。不言脾肾二脏中寒者，缺文也。然所谓中脏者，乃中五脏所居畔界之郭内，阻隔其经，脏气不得出入，故病。若真中脏则死矣。　　《永类钤方》云：肝中寒，其脉人迎并左关紧而弦，其证恶寒发热，面赤，如有汗，胸中胁下挛急，足不得伸。<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>心中寒者，其脉人迎并左寸紧而洪，其证如啖蒜虀，甚则心痛彻背，恶寒，四肢厥，自吐，皆塞不省。脾中寒，其脉人迎并右关紧而沉，其证心腹胀，四肢挛急，嗳噫不通，脏气不传，或秘或泄。肺中寒，其脉人迎并右寸紧而濇，其证善吐浊，气短不能报息，洒洒而寒，吸吸而咳。肾中寒，其脉人迎并左尺紧而滑，其证色黑气弱，吸吸少气，耳聋腰痛，膝下拘疼，昏不知人。治当审微甚，甚则以姜附汤为主，微则不换金正气散加附子、附子五积散。脐腹痛，四肢厥，附子理中汤、姜附汤。入肝加木瓜，入肺加桑皮，入脾加朮，入心加茯苓。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　　医门法律 【清　喻昌】</p>
<p>　　风寒暑湿燥火六气，分配手足各六经，百病之生，莫不由之。轩岐论列，要在于此。然原始上古经文，先师僦季贷所传。每思洪荒初辟，结绳纪事，书从何来？岂光音天化生世界，早有天医降下乎？抑仰求大自在天而得之乎？然则医药者，上天之载也。穷理尽性至命，首推医学矣。去古渐远，无阶可升。日取《内经》读之，其端绪或有或无，有者可求，无者将何求耶？君相二火及燥气，未曾深及。即寒之一气，赖先圣张仲景推演伤寒中寒为二论。不知中寒论，何以不入金匮之藏？至晋初即无可搜求，并其弟子卫沈四逆三部厥经亦亡，从未有老医宿学记载一语。晋人之浅于谭医，岂待问哉。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>设使晋代仙医许旌阳、葛稚川之流，仰溯丹台紫府大自在天之藏，得其原论，亦未必为当世之所好矣。昌既尚论《伤寒论》，不揣凡驽，窃欲拟议仲景传世之文，以窥见不传之一斑。后及《内经》之风热暑湿，并燥火缺略，百病传讹，绵力任重，老而不休，志非不苦。但以从不见闻之说，定为率由坦道，按剑而诧不祥，在所不免。然十百中岂无二三知己，取其大关，略其小失乎？见为是者，因其是畅发奥旨；见为非者，因其非另竖伟议。总不肯安上世至今相沿之黯汶，而必欲耀之光明。有仲景表章《内经》于前，有诸君子表章《内经》、《金匮》于后。昌于后辈中如杂剧登场，漫引其端要，不谓非个中人物也。且昌数十载寤寐诚求，才脱凡身，必承提命，此番公案，尚有待于再来云。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　　　　阴病论</p>
<p>　　太极动而生阳，静而生阴。阳动而不息，阴静而有常。二气交而人生，二气分而人死；二气偏而病起，二气乖而病笃。圣神忧之，设为医药，调其偏驳，使归和平，而民寿已永。观于生气通天论中，论人身阳气，如天之与日，失其所则折寿而不彰。是虽不言阴病，而阴病之机，宛然可识。但三皇之世如春，阳和司令，阴静不扰。所以《内经》凡言阴病，但启其端，弗竟其说。厥后国政乖讹，阳舒变为阴惨，天之阳气闭塞，地之阴气冒明。冒明者，以阴浊而冒蔽阳明也。百川沸腾，山冢崒崩，高岸为谷，深谷为陵，诗言之矣。民病因之，横夭宏多，究莫识其所以横夭之故。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>汉末张仲景着《伤寒论》十卷，治传经阳病；着《卒病论》六卷，治暴卒阴病。生民不幸，《卒病论》当世即已失传。岂非其时贤士大夫，莫能深维其义，《金匮玉函》，置而弗收，其流布民间者，悉罹兵火之厄耶？仲景已后，英贤辈出，从未有阐扬其烈者。惟韩祗和于中寒一门，微有发明，诲人以用附子、干姜为急，亦可谓仲景之徒矣。然自有医以来，只道其常，仲景兼言其变，诧而按剑，势所必至。越千百年，祇和草泽一家之言，已不似仲景登高之呼。况有丹溪、节斋诸缙绅先生，多主贵阴贱阳。立说曰：阳道饶，阴道乏。曰：阳常有余，阴常不足。曰：阴气难成易亏，故早衰。制为补阴等丸，畸重乎阴，畴非至理。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>第于此道依样壶卢，未具只眼，然世医莫不奉以为宗。即使《卒病论》传之至今，亦与《伤寒论》同其悠悠汶汶也已。嗟乎！化日舒长，太平有象；乱离愁惨，杀运繁兴。救时者，傥以贵阴贱阳为政教，必国非其国；治病者倘以贵阴贱阳为药石，必治乖其治矣，岂通论哉。昌尚论仲景《伤寒论》，于凡阴病见端，当以回阳为急者，一一表之，吾俦已骎骎知所先矣。今欲并度金针，畅言底里。《易曰》：通乎昼夜之道。而知夫昼为阳，群阴莫不潜伏；夜为阴，群阴得以现形，诸鬼为之夜食。一切山精水怪，扬氛吐焰，伎俩无穷，比鸡鸣则尽隐矣。盖鸡鸣夜虽未央，而时则为天之阳也。天之阳开，故长夜不至漫漫而将旦也。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>阴病之不可方物，此见一斑，而谁为燃犀之照也哉。佛说四百四病，地水火风各居其一，是则四百四病皆为阴病矣。夫水火木金土，在天成象，在地成形，原不独畸于阴。然而五行皆附地而起，水附于地而水中有火，火中有风。人所以假合成身，身所以相因致病，率禀四者。金性坚刚，不受和合，故四大惟金不与。证无生者，必修西方佛土，有由然也。世人但知地气静而不扰，偶见地动，便骇为异。不知地之小动则为灾眚，大动则为劫卮。劫卮之来，天地万物，凡属有形，同归于坏。然地气有时大动，而世界得不速坏者，则以元天真武，坐镇北方，摄伏龙蛇，不使起陆。以故地动而水不动，水不动而水中之火，火中之风，自不动也。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>仲景于阴盛亡阳之证，必用真武汤以救逆者，非以此乎？至于戌亥混茫，亦非天翻地覆互相混也。天原不混于地，乃地气加天而混之耳。盖地水火风四轮，同时轰转，雷炮冲射之威，千百亿道，震荡于五天之中，顷之搅毁，太空混为一区，而父母所生血肉之躯，其阴病之惨烈，又当何如？禅宗有白浪滔天，劫火同然，大千俱坏等语。岂非四大解散之时，实有此象乎？究竟地气之加于天者，止加于欲界色界等天，不能加于无色界天。<a

class="marker">[11p]</a><br>所以上八景中，忉利天宫，万圣朝真，兜率内院，诸天听法，各各身除中阴，顶现圆光，由此直接非想非非想天，而入佛界法界，睹大千世界，若掌中一珠矣，更何劫运可加之耶？劫运所加之天，至子而开，阴气下而高覆始露，至丑而阴气尽返于地，而太空始廓，两仪分奠厥位。日月星辰丽乎天，华岳河海附乎地，五天之气，散布于列曜，九地之气，会通乎山泽，以清以宁，曰大曰广，庶类以渐萌生。而天界隙中所余暴悍浊阴，动辄绵亘千万丈，排空直坠，摧残所生，靡有孑遗。天开地辟以后，阴惨余殃，尚若此其可畏，必至寅而驳劣悉返冲和，天光下济，地德上乘，名木嘉卉，累累垂实，光音天人，下食其果，不复升举，因得施生，乃至繁衍而成天地人之三界也。此义关系人身性命，病机安危，最宏最巨。儒者且置为不论不议，医者更蔑闻矣。<a

class="marker">[12p]</a><br>昌每见病者阴邪横发，上干清道，必显畏寒腹痛，下利上呕，自汗淋漓，肉瞤筋惕等证，即忙把住关门，行真武坐镇之法，不便龙雷升腾霄汉，一遵仲景已传之秘，其人获安。倘失此不治，顷之浊阴从胸而上入者，咽喉肿痹，舌胀睛突；浊阴从背而上入者，颈筋粗大，头项若冰，转盻浑身青紫而死。谓非地气加天之劫厄乎？惟是陡进附子、干姜纯阳之药，亟驱阴邪下从阴窍而出，非与迅埽浊阴之气，还返地界同义乎。然必尽驱阳隙之阴，不使少留，乃得功收再造，非与一洗天界余氛，俾返冲和同义乎。会仲景意中之法，行之三十年，治经百人，凡遇药到，莫不生全，虽曰一时之权宜，即拟为经常之正法可也。医学缺此，诚为漏义。谨立鄙论，以开其端。<a

class="marker">[13p]</a><br>后有作者，出其广大精微之蕴，是编或有可采云尔。　　卒中寒者，阳微阴盛，最危最急之候。经曰：阴盛生内寒。因厥气上逆，寒气积于胸中而不泄，不泄则温气去寒独留，留则血凝，血凝则脉不通，其脉盛大以濇，故中寒。《内经》之言若此。今欲会仲景表章《内经》之意，敷陈一二，敢辞饶舌乎。　　经既言阴盛生内寒矣，又言外中寒者，岂非内寒先生，外寒后中之耶？经既言血凝脉不通矣，又言其脉盛大以濇者，岂非以外寒中故脉盛大，血脉闭故脉濇耶？此中伏有大疑，请先明之：一者，人身卫外之阳最固，太阳卫身之背，阳明卫身之前，少阳卫身之两侧。今不由三阳而直中少阴，岂是从天而下？盖厥气上逆积于胸中则胃寒，胃寒则口食寒物，鼻吸寒气，皆得入胃。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>肾者，胃之关也。外寒斩关直入少阴肾脏，故曰中寒也。此《内经》所隐而未言者也。一者，其脉盛大以濇，虽曰中寒，尚非卒病。卒病中寒，其脉必微。盖《内经》统言伤寒中寒之脉，故曰盛大以濇。仲景以伤寒为热病，中寒为寒病，分别言之。伤寒之脉，大要以大浮数动滑为阳，沉濇弱弦微为阴。阳病而见阴脉且主死，况阴病卒急，必无反见阳脉之理。若只盛大以濇，二阳一阴，亦何卒急之有哉？此亦《内经》所隐而难窥者也。　　再推仲景以沉濇弱弦微为阴脉矣。其伤寒传入少阴经，则曰脉微细。今寒中少阴，又必但言脉微，不言细矣。盖微者，阳之微也；细者，阴之细也。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>寒邪传肾，其亡阳亡阴尚未可定，至中寒则但有亡阳而无亡阴，故知其脉必不细也。若果见细脉，则其阴先已内亏，何由而反盛耶？　　在伤寒证，惟少阴有微脉，他经则无。其太阳膀胱为少阴之腑，才见脉微恶寒，仲景早从少阴施治，而用附子干姜矣。盖脉微恶寒，正阳微所至。诗云：彼月而微，此日而微；今此下民，亦孔之哀。在天象之阳，且不可微，然则人身之阳，顾可微哉。肾中既阴盛阳微，寒自内生，复加外寒斩关直中，或没其阳于内，灭顶罹殃；或逼其阳于外，隙驹避舍，其人顷刻云亡，故仲景以为卒病也。　　人身血肉之躯，皆阴也。父母构精时，一点真阳，先身而生，藏于两肾之中，而一身之元气，由之以生，故谓生气之原。<a

<p><strong>Cold Conditions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Verification and Treatment Guidelines</strong> [Ming Dynasty, Wang Kengtang]</p>
<p><strong>Moderate Cold</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of moderate cold are characterized by rigidity of the body, inability to speak, trembling of the limbs, chills, occasional warmth, sudden dizziness, and a lack of sweating. These indicate an invasion of cold toxins. How does this differ from an injury due to cold? The answer is: injury due to cold presents with fever, while moderate cold does not produce fever. Zhongjing (a famous physician) elaborated on cold injuries, but moderate cold not generating heat was not fully addressed. Why is this? The explanation is that yang is active while yin is passive; movement leads to change, while stillness leads to stability. Although cold is a yin pathogen, once it is stagnant and turns into heat, it follows the movement of yang, leading to varying changes without a consistent formula. Therefore, it’s essential to carefully analyze the diseases it causes. In the case of not producing heat, the pathogen is trapped within the yin form, stable and unchanging. Since it does not change, it remains confined to the area affected by cold, thereby causing illness, leading to the conclusion that it does not require elaborate discussion.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

If the condition is mild, add five accumulations powder with a bit of Xiang Fu, and for a more severe condition, use ginger attachment decoction. If the person gradually revives, their body warms up, and they can speak slightly, one should ask if there are any other symptoms. If the pulse is cold, slow, and tense, accompanied by a strong and flooding quality causing stabbing pain, use Fu Zi&#39;s regulating middle decoction with half a qian of Mu Xiang. If the condition includes wind and is floating, causing dizziness and numbness, add one qian of Fang Feng; if it involves dampness and is swollen, painful, add one qian of Bai Zhu; if the muscles and tendons are tense, add one qian of Mu Guo; if there is pain in the limbs and joints, add one qian of Gui; it is also advisable to moxibustion the Dan Tian point for better results. Generally, if the issue is in the skin, it is floating; in the flesh, it is harsh, heavy, or pooled liquid.

If it enters the six organs and five viscera, Zhang Zhongjing mentioned this in the &quot;Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber.&quot; When there is cold in the lungs, it results in coughing up turbid phlegm. If there is cold in the liver, the arms cannot be lifted, the tongue is dry, one desires to sigh deeply, and there is pain in the chest that prevents turning to the side, leading to vomiting and sweating. When there is cold in the heart, the person feels as if their heart is gnawed like garlic; in serious cases, heart pain radiates to the back, and back pain penetrates to the heart, akin to being stung by insects, and if the pulse is floating, vomiting brings relief. Not mentioning cold in the spleen and kidneys is a gap in the text. However, what is called the mid-jiao refers to the area enveloping the five organs, where the channels are obstructed, preventing the energy of the organs from entering or exiting, leading to illness. If there were true mid-jiao issues, one would die. The &quot;Eternal Collection of Formulas&quot; states: When there is cold in the liver, the pulse at the Renying (person meeting) and left Guan (revolution) is tight and string-like. The symptoms include aversion to cold with fever, a red face as if sweating, and cramps beneath the chest and flank, with the feet unable to stretch.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Medical Laws</strong><br><em>By Yu Chang (Qing Dynasty)</em></p>
<p>The six vital energies of wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, and fire divide among the six meridians of the hands and feet; the emergence of all diseases stems from these. This is foundational to the discussions in the &quot;Xuandi&quot; and &quot;Qilian&quot; texts. However, the ancient scriptures from primordial times were transmitted by earlier masters, who borrowed from ancient knowledge. I often ponder about the early days of creation, when knots of cord recorded events—where did writing come from? Was it solely the transformation of celestial sounds giving birth to the world, or did heavenly physicians descend to impart it? Or perhaps, was it sought from the great freedom of heaven? Thus, medicine is the tool bestowed by heaven. To exhaust reason and understand nature to the utmost, one must first prioritize medicine. As time progresses and we move further from antiquity, there appears to be no ladder to ascend. Daily, I read the &quot;Neijing,&quot; and whether its beginnings and ends are manifest or not—what can be sought in what is evident, and what can be sought in what is not? The two fires of rulers and ministers and the dryness have not been deeply considered. Regarding the cold energy, it relies on the earlier sage Zhang Zhongjing’s discussions about external and internal cold from febrile conditions. But how is the theory of internal cold not included in the treasures of &quot;Jinkui&quot;? By the early Jin dynasty, there was little to investigate; even the treatises of his disciple Wei Shen on the three divisions were lost, with no record of any words left by old medical masters or learned practitioners. The shallowness of Jin people regarding medical discussions stands in stark contrast—did we need to question it?<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If we consider the celestial physicians of the Jin Dynasty, such as Xu Jingyang and Ge Zhichuan, who sought to trace back to the treasures of the Great Freedom of the Purple Mansion on the Dan Platform and understand their original theories, it does not necessarily mean they would be favored in today&#39;s world. While Chang revered the &quot;Treatise on Cold Damage,&quot; he did not underestimate the ordinary and mediocre, secretly wishing to draft commentary on the texts passed down by Zhongjing to glimpse a fragment of the untransmitted knowledge. Later, regarding the concepts of wind, heat, summer dampness, and the deficiencies of dryness and fire from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; he noted the misrepresentation of various ailments, feeling the weight of numerous burdens without rest in old age, and although he did not shy away from hardship, he was also limited by the hearsay he encountered. Thus, he adhered to the principle of following the straightforward path, pondering its ominous implications. Nevertheless, among the many, could there not be a few who understand him? Shouldn&#39;t we take the essence while overlooking minor faults? Those who recognize what is right bring forth profound meanings; those who point out what is wrong propose noteworthy arguments. Ultimately, one cannot simply accept the obscurity of the generations past and must strive for brilliance. With Zhongjing&#39;s exposition of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; in the forefront, and gentlemen’s expositions of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; thereafter, Chang&#39;s role among the later generations resembles that of an actor in a mixed drama, casually touching upon its essentials without claiming to be one of the central figures. Furthermore, having genuinely sought for decades, from waking to sleeping, and having just transcended the ordinary, he must now bear the divine charge; this case still awaits further deliberation.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　太极动而生阳，静而生阴。阳动而不息，阴静而有常。二气交而人生，二气分而人死；二气偏而病起，二气乖而病笃。圣神忧之，设为医药，调其偏驳，使归和平，而民寿已永。观于生气通天论中，论人身阳气，如天之与日，失其所则折寿而不彰。是虽不言阴病，而阴病之机，宛然可识。但三皇之世如春，阳和司令，阴静不扰。所以《内经》凡言阴病，但启其端，弗竟其说。厥后国政乖讹，阳舒变为阴惨，天之阳气闭塞，地之阴气冒明。冒明者，以阴浊而冒蔽阳明也。百川沸腾，山冢崒崩，高岸为谷，深谷为陵，诗言之矣。民病因之，横夭宏多，究莫识其所以横夭之故。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Yin Diseases</strong></p>
<p>The Tai Chi moves to generate Yang, and rests to generate Yin. Yang moves ceaselessly, while Yin is still and constant. The interaction of the two energies brings forth life, and their separation leads to death; when the energies are imbalanced, illness arises, and when they are in conflict, the disease deepens. The wise are troubled by this, creating medicine to adjust their imbalance, restoring harmony, so that the people&#39;s lives may be prolonged. Observing the theory of vital energy reaching the heavens, we discuss the Yang energy of the human body, which is like the sun in the sky; when it is misplaced, life is shortened and not revealed. Although this text does not explicitly mention yin diseases, the mechanisms of such diseases can be recognized. In the era of the Three Sovereigns, the springtime ruled with Yang, and Yin remained undisturbed. Therefore, in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; all mentions of yin diseases only hint at their beginnings and do not elaborate further. Later, with the disarray of government, the flourishing Yang transformed into gloomy Yin; the Yang energy of heaven became blocked, while the Yin energy of the earth intruded upon the brightness. This intrusion arises from the murky Yin obscuring the Yang’s brightness. Rivers boil, mountains collapse, high banks become valleys, and deep valleys emerge as hills, as the poems have stated. The people suffer from these conditions, facing untimely deaths in numerous instances, yet few understand the reasons behind such premature endings.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At the end of the Han dynasty, Zhang Zhongjing wrote the &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; in ten volumes, addressing the treatment of yang illnesses. He also composed the &quot;Treatise on Sudden Diseases&quot; in six volumes, dealing with sudden yin illnesses. The common people suffered greatly, and &quot;Treatise on Sudden Diseases&quot; had already been lost in that era. Was it not that the wise scholars of the time failed to deeply contemplate its meaning, leaving the &quot;Golden Coffer and Jade Box&quot; untouched, while those that circulated among the people were all afflicted by the ravages of war? After Zhongjing, many talented individuals emerged, yet none have elaborated on his outstanding work. Only Han Zhi, adhering to the school of Internal Cold, made some minor innovations, teaching the use of Aconite and Dried Ginger as urgent treatments; he can also be considered a disciple of Zhongjing. However, since the emergence of medicine, only the usual practices have been discussed, while Zhongjing spoke of variations, astonished and brandishing a sword, indicating that it was inevitable. Over the course of hundreds of years, the sayings of the grass and swamp have diverged and seem unlike Zhongjing&#39;s high call. Furthermore, figures like Danxi and Jiezai, among the literati, mostly advocated valuing yin over yang. They posited: yang is abundant, while yin is scarce; yang is often excessive, while yin is always insufficient; yin energy is difficult to complete and easy to deplete, hence the early decline. They devised tonics to replenish yin, which excessively emphasized yin; was this not contrary to the ultimate principle?<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In this way, regarding the Dao, one follows the example of the gourd, lacking only the single eye; nevertheless, no physician in the world does not revere it as the foundation. Even the &quot;Treatise on Sudden Illness&quot; has been passed down to the present day, comparable to the &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases,&quot; both enduring through time. Alas! As the days extend and peace prevails, there are signs of tranquility; yet in times of chaos and sorrow, death and strife abound. Those who seek to save the times might wrongly prioritize Yin over Yang in governance, leading to a country that is not truly theirs; likewise, those who attempt to treat illnesses by valuing Yin over Yang through medicinal means will inevitably misalign their methods, as such reasoning is not universally applicable. </p>
<p>The emphasis on the doctrine of Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s &quot;Treatise on Febrile Diseases&quot; indicates that for any Yin-related illness, the restoration of Yang should be regarded as urgent. Each case ought to be clearly outlined, and we, having learned this, already know where to begin. Now, I wish to delve into the golden needle and speak on the deeper truths. The Book of Changes states: it connects to the principles of day and night. The day represents Yang, and all Yin entities remain concealed; the night represents Yin, allowing all Yin to manifest, where various spirits feed during the night. All kinds of mountain spirits and water monsters, unleashing mists and flames, create endless tricks, but at the crowing of a rooster, they all promptly hide away. For even though the night is not yet ended with the rooster&#39;s crow, it signifies the arrival of daylight. With the emergence of daylight, the long night will not stretch on forever but will soon approach dawn.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The illness of Yin cannot be categorized by mere appearances; one only sees a glimpse, yet who is the one that illuminates with the burning rhinoceros? The Buddha spoke of four hundred and four diseases, each corresponding to earth, water, fire, and wind, thus all four hundred and four diseases are indeed Yin illnesses. Water, fire, wood, metal, and earth form images in the sky and take shape on the ground; they do not solely belong to Yin. However, the five elements arise attached to the earth; water attaches to the earth and within water is fire, and within fire is wind. Humanity combines these elements to form a body, and the body is influenced by them, thereby causing illness, as they all nourish the four elements. Metal is naturally hard and rigid, resistant to combination; thus, among the four conditions, only metal remains distinct. To achieve non-birth, one must cultivate in the Western Pure Land of the Buddha, which is a necessary path. </p>
<p>People of the world only know that the earth&#39;s energy remains still and undisturbed; when they occasionally witness an earthquake, they are alarmed and consider it unusual. They do not understand that a slight disturbance of the earth can lead to disasters, while a significant quake leads to total ruin. When destruction comes, all things in heaven and earth, all that is tangible, will return to chaos. Nonetheless, when the earth&#39;s energy stirs greatly, and the world does not swiftly perish, it is because the original celestial true martial force sits firmly in the north, subduing the dragons and snakes, preventing them from rising. Therefore, when the earth moves, water does not; when water is still, the fire within it and the wind within the fire also remain undisturbed.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

As for the chaos of the dog and pig, it does not mean the heavens and earth are turned upside down and mutually confused. Heaven originally does not mix with earth; rather, it is the earthly qi that combines with heaven and becomes chaotic. Indeed, the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind rotate together, with the might of thunder and cannon firing, countless waves shaking among the five heavens, which, upon impact, causes space to become unified. As for the fleshly body born of parents, in the wake of severe yin illnesses, what then shall be done? The Zen school speaks of towering waves and raging fires, with the destruction of the great cosmos—are these not images of the dissolution of the four elements? Ultimately, the earthly qi that combines with heaven only enhances the desires of the desire realm and form realm, and cannot penetrate into the formless realm.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the eight lofty realms, the heavenly palace of Tàolì, the morning assembly of all saints, the inner courtyard of Dōushuài, and all the heavens listening to the teachings—each being has shed the intermediate state, their crowns radiating pure light. From here, they directly enter the realms beyond thoughts and beyond the non-thoughts, stepping into the Buddha&#39;s sphere and the Dharma realm, witnessing the vast universe as if it were a pearl in the palm of the hand. What further karmic circumstances could be added to this? </p>
<p>When karmic circumstances interact with the heavens, they unfold through the hours. As it reaches the hour of the child, the yang energy rises while the yin energy descends, initially showing itself; by the hour of the ox, the yin energy fully returns to the earth, and the void begins to expand, with the dualities establishing their respective places. The sun, moon, and stars shine in the heavens, while the majestic mountains and seas connect to the earth. The quintessence of the heavens spreads amongst the celestial bodies, while the energies of the nine lands converge in the mountains and marshes, bringing clarity and tranquility, vastness and grandeur, so that all beings gradually begin to emerge.</p>
<p>Yet in the gaps of the heavenly realm, the remaining violent and turbid shadows, extending infinitely, rush through the skies and fall, destroying whatever is born, leaving no remnant. After the heavens opened and the earth was separated, the remaining dark remnants still pose a threat; they must eventually return to chaos, leading to a harmonious balance. The light of the heavens shines down to aid, and the virtues of the earth rise above, with splendid trees and flowers heavily bearing fruit. The heavenly beings partake of their offerings, no longer rising higher, thus allowing life to be bestowed, culminating in the flourishing three realms of heaven, earth, and humanity. </p>
<p>This principle relates profoundly to human life and death, the conditions of health and danger, and is immensely significant. Confucians may set it aside for discussion and debate; physicians may even disregard it further.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Chang often encounters patients with disorders caused by yin evils, manifesting as chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, spontaneous sweating, muscle tremors, and similar symptoms. He promptly closes the gate and employs the True Warrior method, which is unsuitable for great movements of dragon and thunder in the upper heavens. He follows the secret teachings passed down from Zhongjing, ensuring the individual finds peace. If this treatment is neglected, soon the turbid yin will rise from the chest, causing throat swelling and pain, a swollen tongue, and bulging eyes. If the turbid yin rises from the back, it leads to thick neck muscles, ice-cold head and neck, and the body becomes mottled blue and purple, leading to death. Could this not be seen as the earthly energy overwhelmed by heavenly calamities? </p>
<p>The key is to promptly administer the pure yang herbs, such as Fuzi and Ganjiang, to expel the yin evils downward through the yin orifices, which aligns with the concept of quickly sweeping away the turbid yin energy, returning to a state of balance on the earthly plane. It is crucial to thoroughly expel all the yin lingering in the yang spaces, leaving none behind, to ensure effective recovery, separate from merely sweeping away the lingering atmospheric influences of the heavens, which fails to restore the balance. </p>
<p>By adhering to the principles found in Zhongjing&#39;s writings and applying them over thirty years to treat hundreds of individuals, every instance where the right medicine was applied resulted in full recovery.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are subsequent authors who draw upon the vast and subtle essence. This compilation may contain elements worth noting. </p>
<p>In cases of cold attacking the interior, there is a predominance of yin and a deficiency of yang, representing the most dangerous and urgent condition. The classics state: &quot;Yin excess generates internal cold.&quot; This results in the counterflow of qi, leading to accumulated cold within the chest that fails to disperse. If it does not disperse, warmth departs and cold remains. The presence of cold leads to blood stagnation, causing the pulse to be blocked; thus, the pulse becomes full and firm, indicating internal cold. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; speaks of this.</p>
<p>Now, I seek to reconcile Zhang Zhongjing’s interpretations with the essence of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and elaborate a bit, daring to extend my discourse. The classics mention that an excess of yin generates internal cold, and also speak of external cold affecting the interior; could this not imply that internal cold comes first, followed by external cold affecting the interior? The classics also say that blood stagnates and the pulse is obstructed; does this not indicate that an excess of external cold causes a strong pulse, while blood stasis leads to a coarse pulse? Within this lies a significant doubt, and I wish to clarify: first, in the human body, the protective yang is the most solid. The Taiyang guards the back, the Yangming guards the front, and the Shaoyang protects the sides. Now, if one moves directly through the three yang channels to reach the Shaoyin, is this not akin to descending from the heavens? It is understood that the counterflow of qi accumulates within the chest, causing stomach cold; when the stomach is cold, one consumes cold foods and inhales cold air, all of which can enter the stomach.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The kidney is the gateway of the stomach. When external cold directly invades the lesser yin kidney, it is referred to as &quot;middle cold.&quot; This is something that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; hints at but does not explicitly state. One point is that its pulse is large and strong; although it is called &quot;middle cold,&quot; it does not indicate a complete disease. In cases of sudden disease caused by middle cold, the pulse must be weak. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; comprehensively discusses the pulse patterns of cold due to invasion, hence it mentions the larger and vigorous pulse. Zhongjing categorizes cold damage as a heat disease and middle cold as a cold disease, explaining them separately. The pulse of cold damage generally features a large, floating, rapid, and slippery quality as yang, while a sinking, thick, weak, and subtle quality represents yin. If a yang pulse appears in a yang disease, it is indicative of death; consequently, in a sudden acute yin disease, there should be no return of a yang pulse. If it is merely large and vigorous, with two yang and one yin, why would there be sudden urgency? This is also something that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; hints at but is difficult to discern.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Zhongjing describes sinking, thick, weak, and subtle pulses as yin, if cold damage transmits into the lesser yin channel, it is said that the pulse is weak and subtle. Now, in middle cold of the lesser yin, it must only refer to the weak pulse, not the subtle one. This is because &quot;weak&quot; pertains to the subtlety of yang, while &quot;subtle&quot; pertains to the delicateness of yin.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When cold邪 affects the kidneys, the loss of yang and perhaps the loss of yin cannot be determined yet. When it reaches a state of extreme cold, there is only the loss of yang without the loss of yin; therefore, the pulse must not be thin. If a thin pulse is indeed felt, it indicates that the yin has already been depleted internally—how could it then recover? </p>
<p>In the case of cold damage, only the lesser yin has a faint pulse, while other channels do not. The bladder of the greater yang is the organ of the lesser yin, and when a faint pulse is felt, there is aversion to cold. Thus, Zhongjing originally treated the lesser yin using aconite and ginger. The faint pulse and aversion to cold signify the approach of true yang is slight. </p>
<p>As the poem states: &quot;That moon is faint, and this sun is faint; now these lowly people, too, grieve in sorrow.&quot; In the heavenly phenomena, yang cannot be weak; thus, can the yang within the human body be weak? With yin in the kidneys being abundant and yang being slight, cold is naturally generated from within, compounded by external cold cutting directly through. It may either bury yang within, leading to disaster, or push yang outward, causing one to be overwhelmed, often resulting in sudden death—hence, Zhongjing considered it a sudden illness. </p>
<p>The physical body of a person is entirely yin. When the parents conceive, a single point of true yang is born first and stored within the two kidneys, from which the essence of life is generated, thus referred to as the source of vitality.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Outside the six excesses, no evil dares to invade; thus, they are called the guardians against temptation. In a dark room, a single lamp shines brightly until dawn; the eyes and ears rely on it for clarity, the hands and feet depend on it for action. In ancient times, people braved the snow and cold, seeking poetry and friends, yet they still spoke of a fleeting moment of inspiration. As for achieving merit in distant lands or enduring hardships like biting cold, how often does one forget internal cold while facing external cold? Therefore, by cultivating the innate with the acquired, one can enjoy it for a hundred years. If not, the slightest yang will surely lead to an excess of yin, and as yin increases, yang will further decrease. If the outer cold suddenly arrives, and one relies on habitual methods for treatment, what are the chances that one in a hundred will survive? Is the essence of illness contained within this? The true yang in the kidneys is supported by water, remaining attached and unseparated; it is confined by earth, hiding and not revealing. Aside from release and drainage, it remains steadfast and unmoving. The yang of the hands and feet is employed to move throughout the body, protecting the pores and guarding the exterior; the yang in the spleen mirrors the strength of heaven, digesting food, distributing fluids, and operating internally; the yang in the chest reflects the regulation of the sun, illuminating the sky above, dissipating yin and removing gloom, proclaiming it upwards.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>These three elements represent abundance and prosperity; the true yang in the kidneys enjoys tranquility and peace, hence it is possible for an eighty-year-old to father a child, and those with remaining vigor can still engage in commerce. Even if one indulges excessively, leading to impotence and lack of use, one can still prolong the years. The crucial issue lies in the external and internal yang: when it weakens and becomes unresponsive, the yin energy begins to take precedence. If the skin is cold and lacks warmth, it may lead to stiff muscles; the external yang is no longer functional. If digestion fails, one may experience nausea, diarrhea, and bloating; the internal yang of the spleen is not working. If there is obstruction in the chest, it can result in blockage and tightness; the yang within the chest is not functioning. Then, one may resort to the yang sealed by water and earth, taking on responsibilities, and while the head receives some yang and turns red, the skin may suffer damage and dryness, and the spleen and stomach may obtain yang but not be free from cold; how can one endure long? </p>
<p>In the presence of cold and a slight yin, strict measures must be taken to eliminate the faint yang, leading to skin that is frozen and cold, devoid of sweat and spirit. It is urgent to use Aconite and dried ginger along with scallions to disperse the cold, and add pig bile to direct it into the yin. However, if there is concern that the medicinal power may not suffice, one should apply hot scallions and moxa to attack both externally and internally, which is essential to break the hard obstruction. One must take a moment to pause; otherwise, it will be too late. This is a difficult situation.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a person’s true yang energy is weak and their pores are naturally open, with yin being excessive internally, it will inevitably cause their yang to diminish externally, resulting in profuse sweating and a stiff neck and spine. Using aconite, ginger, and pig bile is essential, but do not add scallions or apply heat, as this might aid dispersion, making the qi exit with the sweat, leaving no way for yang to return from within. It is necessary to stop the sweating, sharply administer the aforementioned medicines, and continuously reinforce the protection of the pores. Otherwise, there is a risk that the yang may be further depleted. This is a challenging situation.</p>
<p>Using aconite and ginger to counteract yin and restore yang is akin to cavalry breaking through a siege, raising flags to rally the scattered yang, thereby facilitating its reunion. Those who do not understand this principle will increase the dosage of medicines and mix them into a decoction, inadvertently restraining the force that should penetrate, making the effort slow and ineffective. This poses another difficulty.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the initial medicines, one must prioritize adding angelica and cinnamon to address the vitality. Since cold pathogens invade, they first damage the blood of the vital organs. Otherwise, if the medicines focus solely on defending the exterior, without benefiting the interior, they will not be appropriate for the ailment, and the pathogen will not be entirely eliminated, leading to a lack of favorable outcome.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Moreover, one must include ginseng and licorice in the initial medicine to adjust the essence and nourish the body, achieving the desired effects. Otherwise, the fierceness of ginger and aconite will provoke conflicts with the superior. This is the fifth difficulty.</p>
<p>After taking two or three doses of the initial medicine, one may feel the yang aspect within themselves, experience light movements, and have a spirited demeanor. Further, it is essential to add astragalus, white atractylodes, five-flavored fruit, and white peony to equally supplement both yin and yang without pause. The heaviness of yin may show a sign of decline, like a prodigal son returning home; at this moment, if one is unsteady and neglects the necessary follow-up, they will surely squander previous accomplishments. This is the sixth difficulty.</p>
<p>By using a combination of medicines to cultivate yin and protect yang, it is understood that the person may already possess heat-phlegm, and yang has long transformed into cold from yin. At this point, although the intangible yin cold may be dispersed, the tangible cold phlegm blocking the passages cannot abruptly convert to heat. Therefore, while ginger and aconite can be omitted, all cold and cooling components like ox gall and bamboo mucus must not be used. If one carelessly employs cold remedies due to existing heat-phlegm, yin will again become involved, leading to turmoil in yang, which will surely waste prior efforts.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From now on, there will always be stubborn phlegm accumulating in the meridians; therefore, one should adopt a mild and cold approach to assist the qi in opening up, and avoid spicy and hot substances that can cause blockage. Spicy foods are often used as a last resort; once the Yang is stabilized, one should nurture the Yin. How can one seek to achieve results through effort, only to let the disease persist while the medicine remains, thus giving rise to other ailments, leaving no peace? This is one of the eight difficulties.</p>
<p>I briefly outline the disease concepts and clearly state the eight difficulties. A skilled practitioner must exert effort; this way, the method may become clear and actionable. However, the unrefined and rigid practitioners will surely not succeed; ignorant individuals who are poorly informed will inevitably be filled with doubts and fears about taking medicine.

If there are internal injuries accompanied by this condition, one should add dispersing herbs to the Ba Zhen Decoction, starting with ginseng and astragalus to support the righteous qi.

<p>Dai Yuanli states: &quot;Middle cold&quot; refers to the body receiving the chill of autumn, eating ice water, melons, and cold items. When the patient presents with a deep, fine pulse, cold hands and feet, weak breath, and fatigue, even if their body feels hot, they do not thirst and may speak weakly. If they encounter a heat disease and mistakenly take cold medicines, the consequences can be severe, even leading to death. In cases with a rapid pulse or those who drink water frequently and feel restless, they are signs of heat disease. Cold and heat are like water and fire; they cannot be treated the same way, as this can be deadly, so one must be cautious!</p>
<p>Note that Yuanli is an esteemed physician of the current dynasty. Regarding middle cold, he has grasped the broad concept but has not understood the deeper principles. He incorrectly states that treating it as a heat disease will lead to death, which is a significant misunderstanding of the principle of treatment.

<p>The Six Indications of Color and Pulses:</p>
<p>A color of coldness must manifest as blue, for blue is associated with the liver. Therefore, Zhongjing said: if the tip of the nose is blue and there is pain in the abdomen, one with severe cold will die. This refers to the Shao Yin coexisting with the cold of the kidney water; extreme cold leads to the loss of yang, and the loss of yang leads to death. If the lips and mouth are blue and the body cold, it indicates imminent death. The five organs belong to yin, which store essences and house spirits. When blood and qi are obstructed by cold evils, the genuine essence of the organs cannot circulate, leading to the loss of spiritual function, blocking the paths of rising and falling, entry and exit, with the absence of nourishment causing the lips and mouth to appear blue. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: if the foot&#39;s Jue Yin energy ceases, the lips turn blue. The liver stores blood, so when qi is obstructed, it is evident that nourishment is cut off. If the pulse is absent, it indicates imminent death; if the pulse returns, one recovers. Absent means gone.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The meridians are the conduits of the organs. When pressured by cold, the vital energy escapes from the meridians, leading to death if it enters the internal organs, but healing occurs if it enters the internal cavities. The text states: when blood and vital energy flow together upward, it results in sudden death by great collapse. The &quot;upward&quot; refers to the middle jiao, which is a cavity, and does not fully point to the internal organs. Similarly, if an evil influence obstructs the five collaterals, resembling a state of death, treatment involves restoring the circulation of blood in the meridians. This pertains mainly to the channels in the head and face; restoring the circulation of blood there results in healing and does not solely imply the internal cavities. Thus, the escape of the meridian&#39;s energy into the organs or cavities indicates certain signs. The obstruction of blood and energy in the upper part indicates symptoms of disease. Careful examination and consideration of these factors will clarify life or death outcomes.</p>
<p>If the middle cold causes the pulse to disperse, it results in death. Indeed, if the energy escapes inward, it disperses outward. The inward escape still distinguishes between the organs, while the outward escape results in a complete loss of Yang and cannot be regained. </p>
<p>When the pulse at the wrist is slow, stagnant, and fine, it signifies cold in the lower jiao. If the vital energy is warmed and the cold dispelled, the person may recover.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Treatment of Cold Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Cold diseases may originate externally or internally. Externally, they may arise from wind and cold injuring the body or from cold foods harming the organs. Internally, they may result from fatigue damaging the yang or from a weak constitution. If cold enters from the outside, it usually progresses from superficial to deep, often causing symptoms such as nausea, bloating, or abdominal pain and diarrhea. When cold originates internally, it affects the organs and manifests at the surface, leading to chills, aversion to cold, or symptoms of reversal and spasm. In summary, heat is often associated with excess, while cold is frequently linked to deficiency. Therefore, in treating cold syndromes, one must consider both the deficiency and the condition of the organs; this is not an easy principle to adhere to. Cold toxins that directly affect the three yin channels correspond to what is known in the category of cold damage as direct involvement with the yin channels.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

His limbs were cold, he had cold sweats, and his breath was also cold. The six pulses were like spider silk, and he occasionally felt faint. The other doctors proposed to apply scallion on the abdomen and prescribed Wuxi Decoction with five taels, twenty slices of raw ginger, and nine sections of scallion greens, boiled with three sheng of water until reduced to one sheng, then strained and cooled before drinking. By midnight, his body felt warm, and he craved porridge, and by dawn, he had recovered. </p>
<p>Yujizhen Zang stated: The pulse is thin, the skin is cold, the qi is depleted, leading to diarrhea and lack of appetite. This condition is known as the five depletions. If gruel enters the stomach, the depleted energy revives. Truly! Master Lu Zhai remarked: Illness has various degrees of severity, prescriptions have variances in size, and treatment has varying urgency. The condition of the officer cannot be cured unless a significant prescription is utilized for urgent treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Zhendingsi Wudeqing, aged 46, in the third month of the Bingzi year during the Yuan dynasty, fell ill due to worry and overwork, leading to irregular eating and drinking. His body was cold, his mouth and nose were also cold, and he had a cool sweat on his forehead. At times, he felt dizzy, and his pulse was faint like spider silk. One physician diagnosed him with a wind condition and wanted to use the Xuanfeng Powder to dispel it. I recalled the discussion on the creation of Xuanfeng Powder for children by the Qian family, noting that internal damage to the spleen and stomach in children could lead to either vomiting or diarrhea, and if prolonged, the wind pathogen could become lodged in the stomach, causing diarrhea. There are knots within the powder, leading to concern over lingering shock, thus the Xuanfeng Powder was used to guide out the wind pathogen. The Inner Canon states: &quot;Prolonged wind causes food poisoning,&quot; which is exactly what this refers to. Now, the condition of Deqing indicates an excess of yin and a deficiency of yang; a bitter cold medicine is not appropriate. The Inner Canon also says: &quot;Excessive yin leads to profuse sweating and cold body.&quot;<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Theory of Yin and Yang Correspondences&quot; states: When Yin is strong, the body feels cold with sweat, and the body remains clear. If one shivers, they feel cold; if cold persists, it leads to fainting. The &quot;Regulation of the Channels&quot; also says: Excessive Yin produces internal cold. Qibo explained: The energy of fainting rises and the cold accumulates in the chest without being expelled. If it is not expelled, warm energy departs, leaving only cold, thus resulting in internal cold. Dongyuan commented: This is due to insufficient spleen and stomach, overexertion of the body, and the central Qi being affected by illness, leading to cold accumulation. Therefore, it is necessary to tonify Yang. Thus, I prescribed a modified formula of Lichong Decoction with black Aconite, taking five qian each time, and commonly using scallion white to stew mutton soup, taking the clear broth in a large cup at the prescribed times. By evening, the limbs gradually warmed and there was slight sweating. I repeated it late at night. The following day, one&#39;s spirit revived, and the pulses were strong. After several doses, it was cured. I recall Li Sishun saying: The symptom is the evidence; the disease manifests internally, while the symptoms appear externally. Any physician who does not consult the &quot;Nèijīng,&quot; does not seek the source of the illness, arbitrarily interprets the symptoms, and rigidly follows formulas is deviating from the fundamentals, which can lead to many mistakes.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Minister Shen, aged sixty-two, had a pre-existing condition of stomach deficiency. In the summer of the year of the Earth Serpent (己巳), he was residing in the capital when, in June, there was an incessant heavy rain. Due to excessive labor from public duties, his eating and drinking were irregular, causing daily abdominal pain, and he often had to relieve himself, feeling only slight relief afterward. He had no appetite, was disinclined to speak, and felt fatigued. He called for me to treat him. I examined his pulse, which was deep, slow, and slightly taut. Given Minister Shen&#39;s advanced age and weakened vitality, along with his longstanding cold deficiency of the spleen and stomach, compounded by the incessant rain, excessive labor, and irregular eating, his middle Qi was severely deficient. The &quot;Nan Jing&quot; states: excessive eating and fatigue injure the spleen. If there is deficiency, it may lead to excess. If the year&#39;s fire is insufficient, cold prevails greatly, resulting in the people suffering from diarrhea.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Currently, the spleen and stomach vital energy is insufficient, and the kidney water must intertwine with the wood element, thereby offending the earth. Such a condition cannot be withstood by the weak and is a consequence of being overpowered. This illness cannot be treated with sweet, pungent, and very warm herbs; otherwise, it cannot drain water or nourish the earth. Even in the midst of summer heat, there are warnings against excess heat; it is said that those who are already afflicted should be treated according to the situation in order to address urgent matters. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: Cold that infiltrates internally should be treated with pungent and warm substances. Dried ginger and aconite are used due to their pungent, bitter, and very warm properties to drain cold water; they serve as the main ingredients. For those with spleen deficiency, nourishment should be sweet, utilizing ginseng, white atractylodes, licorice, and dried mandarin peel, which are bitter and sweet with warm properties to supplement the spleen and earth. When the stomach is cold, leading to loss of appetite, fresh ginger and cardamom, which are pungent and warm, can alleviate cold that attacks the stomach. Magnolia bark is pungent and warm, benefiting the intestines and stomach. White poria is sweet and neutral, aiding ginger and aconite in guiding out cold dampness. White peony root is slightly cold and sour, supplementing metal and draining wood, helping to prevent heat from damaging lung Qi. If taken multiple times, the effect will be evident.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<p>Chen Huku&#39;s mother had long suffered from abdominal pain, which was accompanied by chest fullness and vomiting, with cold extremities, flushed face, numb lips, dry throat, and a fluctuating pulse. Others treated her for phlegm-fire, but her symptoms repeatedly recurred. In the spring of the year of Yisi, she suddenly experienced severe heat and restlessness, and medication only worsened her condition. Zhu Cunmo suggested that this was caused by taking cold and cooling medicines and wanted to use ginseng and poria. Doubting the efficacy of pain-relief methods, he then sought my help. Upon diagnosis, I sighed and said: This is due to cold and cooling harming the true essence, resulting in internal true cold while appearing to have outward false heat. Furthermore, the pulse was string-like and large with unusual characteristics, indicating a deficiency of spleen energy, with the liver meridian overpowering it. The only solution was to warm and nourish the stomach. Therefore, I prescribed a mixture of Buzhong Yiqi Decoction, with added Banxia, Fulian, Wuzhuyu, and Muxiang.

He was treated with a decoction of ginseng to nourish the stomach, supplemented with herbs like chuanxiong, angelica, and others, which alleviated all symptoms. The next day, however, he experienced severe abdominal pain. He found that pressing his abdomen eased the pain, indicating a deficiency in the spleen with cold invading, leading to internal deficiency and a false exterior heat. He was given a modified version of Xiangsha Liujunzi Decoction with additional herbs, which reduced the pain significantly. After adjusting the prescription, he was cured within an hour.</p>
<p>Wang from the local school had a generally weak vitality, and after two years of exhausting examinations during the bingwu and dingwei years, his health deteriorated by December. He exhibited a high fever, excessive tearing that caused congestion, redness in his eyes, a darkened face, a heavy breath almost on the verge of collapse, a rapid and strong pulse found to be almost absent upon examination, and a dry tongue feeling like a stab, indicating true internal cold and false external heat. He then took a tonic famously known as the Ten Complete Tonics. I suggested that after taking this formula, his pulse should gradually stabilize. Soon he fell into a deep sleep, but upon awakening, he felt even colder and noticed his pulse had become thin like a thread, marking true internal cold. I then gave him an ounce of ginseng combined with three qian of cooked aconite, which he took to recover. That night his pulse dropped again, so I adjusted the dosage to two ounces of ginseng and five qian of cooked aconite, which helped him recover once more. Later, he was stabilized with larger doses of ginseng, atractylodes, rhemannia, and fried licorice for further treatment.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

These indicate an invasion of cold toxins. How does this differ from an injury due to cold? The answer is: injury due to cold presents with fever, while moderate cold does not produce fever. Zhongjing (a famous physician) elaborated on cold injuries, but moderate cold not generating heat was not fully addressed. Why is this? The explanation is that yang is active while yin is passive; movement leads to change, while stillness leads to stability. Although cold is a yin pathogen, once it is stagnant and turns into heat, it follows the movement of yang, leading to varying changes without a consistent formula. Therefore, it’s essential to carefully analyze the diseases it causes. In the case of not producing heat, the pathogen is trapped within the yin form, stable and unchanging. Since it does not change, it remains confined to the area affected by cold, thereby causing illness, leading to the conclusion that it does not require elaborate discussion."},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"To treat it, first use wine to mix with the Su He Xiang pills.

If the condition includes wind and is floating, causing dizziness and numbness, add one qian of Fang Feng; if it involves dampness and is swollen, painful, add one qian of Bai Zhu; if the muscles and tendons are tense, add one qian of Mu Guo; if there is pain in the limbs and joints, add one qian of Gui; it is also advisable to moxibustion the Dan Tian point for better results. Generally, if the issue is in the skin, it is floating; in the flesh, it is harsh, heavy, or pooled liquid. If there is splitting pain, it may be localized to the limbs, or in the chest and sides, or in the shins and back, or in the lower abdomen pulling at the testicles, or the meridians affecting the membranes of the organs may result in pain so severe that a person may not know of their surroundings."},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"Located in the muscles and bones, this causes cramps and pain in the bones, leading to difficulties in bending and stretching.

If there is cold in the liver, the arms cannot be lifted, the tongue is dry, one desires to sigh deeply, and there is pain in the chest that prevents turning to the side, leading to vomiting and sweating. When there is cold in the heart, the person feels as if their heart is gnawed like garlic; in serious cases, heart pain radiates to the back, and back pain penetrates to the heart, akin to being stung by insects, and if the pulse is floating, vomiting brings relief. Not mentioning cold in the spleen and kidneys is a gap in the text.

This is foundational to the discussions in the \"Xuandi\" and \"Qilian\" texts. However, the ancient scriptures from primordial times were transmitted by earlier masters, who borrowed from ancient knowledge. I often ponder about the early days of creation, when knots of cord recorded events—where did writing come from? Was it solely the transformation of celestial sounds giving birth to the world, or did heavenly physicians descend to impart it? Or perhaps, was it sought from the great freedom of heaven? Thus, medicine is the tool bestowed by heaven. To exhaust reason and understand nature to the utmost, one must first prioritize medicine. As time progresses and we move further from antiquity, there appears to be no ladder to ascend. Daily, I read the \"Neijing,\" and whether its beginnings and ends are manifest or not—what can be sought in what is evident, and what can be sought in what is not? The two fires of rulers and ministers and the dryness have not been deeply considered. Regarding the cold energy, it relies on the earlier sage Zhang Zhongjing’s discussions about external and internal cold from febrile conditions. But how is the theory of internal cold not included in the treasures of \"Jinkui\"? By the early Jin dynasty, there was little to investigate; even the treatises of his disciple Wei Shen on the three divisions were lost, with no record of any words left by old medical masters or learned practitioners. The shallowness of Jin people regarding medical discussions stands in stark contrast—did we need to question it?"},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"If we consider the celestial physicians of the Jin Dynasty, such as Xu Jingyang and Ge Zhichuan, who sought to trace back to the treasures of the Great Freedom of the Purple Mansion on the Dan Platform and understand their original theories, it does not necessarily mean they would be favored in today's world. While Chang revered the \"Treatise on Cold Damage,\" he did not underestimate the ordinary and mediocre, secretly wishing to draft commentary on the texts passed down by Zhongjing to glimpse a fragment of the untransmitted knowledge. Later, regarding the concepts of wind, heat, summer dampness, and the deficiencies of dryness and fire from the \"Inner Canon,\" he noted the misrepresentation of various ailments, feeling the weight of numerous burdens without rest in old age, and although he did not shy away from hardship, he was also limited by the hearsay he encountered. Thus, he adhered to the principle of following the straightforward path, pondering its ominous implications. Nevertheless, among the many, could there not be a few who understand him? Shouldn't we take the essence while overlooking minor faults? Those who recognize what is right bring forth profound meanings; those who point out what is wrong propose noteworthy arguments. Ultimately, one cannot simply accept the obscurity of the generations past and must strive for brilliance. With Zhongjing's exposition of the \"Inner Canon\" in the forefront, and gentlemen’s expositions of the \"Inner Canon\" and \"Golden Coffer\" thereafter, Chang's role among the later generations resembles that of an actor in a mixed drama, casually touching upon its essentials without claiming to be one of the central figures. Furthermore, having genuinely sought for decades, from waking to sleeping, and having just transcended the ordinary, he must now bear the divine charge; this case still awaits further deliberation."},{"anchor":"trans-7p","marker":"7p","type":"translation","text":"**On Yin Diseases** The Tai Chi moves to generate Yang, and rests to generate Yin. Yang moves ceaselessly, while Yin is still and constant. The interaction of the two energies brings forth life, and their separation leads to death; when the energies are imbalanced, illness arises, and when they are in conflict, the disease deepens. The wise are troubled by this, creating medicine to adjust their imbalance, restoring harmony, so that the people's lives may be prolonged. Observing the theory of vital energy reaching the heavens, we discuss the Yang energy of the human body, which is like the sun in the sky; when it is misplaced, life is shortened and not revealed. Although this text does not explicitly mention yin diseases, the mechanisms of such diseases can be recognized. In the era of the Three Sovereigns, the springtime ruled with Yang, and Yin remained undisturbed. Therefore, in the \"Inner Canon,\" all mentions of yin diseases only hint at their beginnings and do not elaborate further. Later, with the disarray of government, the flourishing Yang transformed into gloomy Yin; the Yang energy of heaven became blocked, while the Yin energy of the earth intruded upon the brightness. This intrusion arises from the murky Yin obscuring the Yang’s brightness. Rivers boil, mountains collapse, high banks become valleys, and deep valleys emerge as hills, as the poems have stated. The people suffer from these conditions, facing untimely deaths in numerous instances, yet few understand the reasons behind such premature endings."},{"anchor":"trans-8p","marker":"8p","type":"translation","text":"At the end of the Han dynasty, Zhang Zhongjing wrote the \"Treatise on Febrile Diseases\" in ten volumes, addressing the treatment of yang illnesses. He also composed the \"Treatise on Sudden Diseases\" in six volumes, dealing with sudden yin illnesses. The common people suffered greatly, and \"Treatise on Sudden Diseases\" had already been lost in that era. Was it not that the wise scholars of the time failed to deeply contemplate its meaning, leaving the \"Golden Coffer and Jade Box\" untouched, while those that circulated among the people were all afflicted by the ravages of war? After Zhongjing, many talented individuals emerged, yet none have elaborated on his outstanding work. Only Han Zhi, adhering to the school of Internal Cold, made some minor innovations, teaching the use of Aconite and Dried Ginger as urgent treatments; he can also be considered a disciple of Zhongjing. However, since the emergence of medicine, only the usual practices have been discussed, while Zhongjing spoke of variations, astonished and brandishing a sword, indicating that it was inevitable. Over the course of hundreds of years, the sayings of the grass and swamp have diverged and seem unlike Zhongjing's high call. Furthermore, figures like Danxi and Jiezai, among the literati, mostly advocated valuing yin over yang. They posited: yang is abundant, while yin is scarce; yang is often excessive, while yin is always insufficient; yin energy is difficult to complete and easy to deplete, hence the early decline. They devised tonics to replenish yin, which excessively emphasized yin; was this not contrary to the ultimate principle?"},{"anchor":"trans-9p","marker":"9p","type":"translation","text":"In this way, regarding the Dao, one follows the example of the gourd, lacking only the single eye; nevertheless, no physician in the world does not revere it as the foundation. Even the \"Treatise on Sudden Illness\" has been passed down to the present day, comparable to the \"Treatise on Febrile Diseases,\" both enduring through time. Alas! As the days extend and peace prevails, there are signs of tranquility; yet in times of chaos and sorrow, death and strife abound. Those who seek to save the times might wrongly prioritize Yin over Yang in governance, leading to a country that is not truly theirs; likewise, those who attempt to treat illnesses by valuing Yin over Yang through medicinal means will inevitably misalign their methods, as such reasoning is not universally applicable. The emphasis on the doctrine of Zhang Zhongjing's \"Treatise on Febrile Diseases\" indicates that for any Yin-related illness, the restoration of Yang should be regarded as urgent. Each case ought to be clearly outlined, and we, having learned this, already know where to begin. Now, I wish to delve into the golden needle and speak on the deeper truths. The Book of Changes states: it connects to the principles of day and night. The day represents Yang, and all Yin entities remain concealed; the night represents Yin, allowing all Yin to manifest, where various spirits feed during the night. All kinds of mountain spirits and water monsters, unleashing mists and flames, create endless tricks, but at the crowing of a rooster, they all promptly hide away. For even though the night is not yet ended with the rooster's crow, it signifies the arrival of daylight. With the emergence of daylight, the long night will not stretch on forever but will soon approach dawn."},{"anchor":"trans-10p","marker":"10p","type":"translation","text":"The illness of Yin cannot be categorized by mere appearances; one only sees a glimpse, yet who is the one that illuminates with the burning rhinoceros? The Buddha spoke of four hundred and four diseases, each corresponding to earth, water, fire, and wind, thus all four hundred and four diseases are indeed Yin illnesses. Water, fire, wood, metal, and earth form images in the sky and take shape on the ground; they do not solely belong to Yin. However, the five elements arise attached to the earth; water attaches to the earth and within water is fire, and within fire is wind. Humanity combines these elements to form a body, and the body is influenced by them, thereby causing illness, as they all nourish the four elements. Metal is naturally hard and rigid, resistant to combination; thus, among the four conditions, only metal remains distinct. To achieve non-birth, one must cultivate in the Western Pure Land of the Buddha, which is a necessary path. People of the world only know that the earth's energy remains still and undisturbed; when they occasionally witness an earthquake, they are alarmed and consider it unusual. They do not understand that a slight disturbance of the earth can lead to disasters, while a significant quake leads to total ruin. When destruction comes, all things in heaven and earth, all that is tangible, will return to chaos. Nonetheless, when the earth's energy stirs greatly, and the world does not swiftly perish, it is because the original celestial true martial force sits firmly in the north, subduing the dragons and snakes, preventing them from rising. Therefore, when the earth moves, water does not; when water is still, the fire within it and the wind within the fire also remain undisturbed."},{"anchor":"trans-11p","marker":"11p","type":"translation","text":"Zhongjing, regarding the symptoms of excessive yin and the decline of yang, must use Zhenwu Decoction to rescue those in reversal; is it not so? As for the chaos of the dog and pig, it does not mean the heavens and earth are turned upside down and mutually confused. Heaven originally does not mix with earth; rather, it is the earthly qi that combines with heaven and becomes chaotic. Indeed, the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind rotate together, with the might of thunder and cannon firing, countless waves shaking among the five heavens, which, upon impact, causes space to become unified. As for the fleshly body born of parents, in the wake of severe yin illnesses, what then shall be done? The Zen school speaks of towering waves and raging fires, with the destruction of the great cosmos—are these not images of the dissolution of the four elements? Ultimately, the earthly qi that combines with heaven only enhances the desires of the desire realm and form realm, and cannot penetrate into the formless realm."},{"anchor":"trans-12p","marker":"12p","type":"translation","text":"In the eight lofty realms, the heavenly palace of Tàolì, the morning assembly of all saints, the inner courtyard of Dōushuài, and all the heavens listening to the teachings—each being has shed the intermediate state, their crowns radiating pure light. From here, they directly enter the realms beyond thoughts and beyond the non-thoughts, stepping into the Buddha's sphere and the Dharma realm, witnessing the vast universe as if it were a pearl in the palm of the hand. What further karmic circumstances could be added to this? When karmic circumstances interact with the heavens, they unfold through the hours. As it reaches the hour of the child, the yang energy rises while the yin energy descends, initially showing itself; by the hour of the ox, the yin energy fully returns to the earth, and the void begins to expand, with the dualities establishing their respective places. The sun, moon, and stars shine in the heavens, while the majestic mountains and seas connect to the earth. The quintessence of the heavens spreads amongst the celestial bodies, while the energies of the nine lands converge in the mountains and marshes, bringing clarity and tranquility, vastness and grandeur, so that all beings gradually begin to emerge. Yet in the gaps of the heavenly realm, the remaining violent and turbid shadows, extending infinitely, rush through the skies and fall, destroying whatever is born, leaving no remnant. After the heavens opened and the earth was separated, the remaining dark remnants still pose a threat; they must eventually return to chaos, leading to a harmonious balance. The light of the heavens shines down to aid, and the virtues of the earth rise above, with splendid trees and flowers heavily bearing fruit. The heavenly beings partake of their offerings, no longer rising higher, thus allowing life to be bestowed, culminating in the flourishing three realms of heaven, earth, and humanity. This principle relates profoundly to human life and death, the conditions of health and danger, and is immensely significant.

He follows the secret teachings passed down from Zhongjing, ensuring the individual finds peace. If this treatment is neglected, soon the turbid yin will rise from the chest, causing throat swelling and pain, a swollen tongue, and bulging eyes. If the turbid yin rises from the back, it leads to thick neck muscles, ice-cold head and neck, and the body becomes mottled blue and purple, leading to death. Could this not be seen as the earthly energy overwhelmed by heavenly calamities? The key is to promptly administer the pure yang herbs, such as Fuzi and Ganjiang, to expel the yin evils downward through the yin orifices, which aligns with the concept of quickly sweeping away the turbid yin energy, returning to a state of balance on the earthly plane. It is crucial to thoroughly expel all the yin lingering in the yang spaces, leaving none behind, to ensure effective recovery, separate from merely sweeping away the lingering atmospheric influences of the heavens, which fails to restore the balance. By adhering to the principles found in Zhongjing's writings and applying them over thirty years to treat hundreds of individuals, every instance where the right medicine was applied resulted in full recovery.

In cases of cold attacking the interior, there is a predominance of yin and a deficiency of yang, representing the most dangerous and urgent condition. The classics state: \"Yin excess generates internal cold.\" This results in the counterflow of qi, leading to accumulated cold within the chest that fails to disperse. If it does not disperse, warmth departs and cold remains. The presence of cold leads to blood stagnation, causing the pulse to be blocked; thus, the pulse becomes full and firm, indicating internal cold. The \"Inner Canon\" speaks of this. Now, I seek to reconcile Zhang Zhongjing’s interpretations with the essence of the \"Inner Canon\" and elaborate a bit, daring to extend my discourse. The classics mention that an excess of yin generates internal cold, and also speak of external cold affecting the interior; could this not imply that internal cold comes first, followed by external cold affecting the interior? The classics also say that blood stagnates and the pulse is obstructed; does this not indicate that an excess of external cold causes a strong pulse, while blood stasis leads to a coarse pulse? Within this lies a significant doubt, and I wish to clarify: first, in the human body, the protective yang is the most solid. The Taiyang guards the back, the Yangming guards the front, and the Shaoyang protects the sides. Now, if one moves directly through the three yang channels to reach the Shaoyin, is this not akin to descending from the heavens? It is understood that the counterflow of qi accumulates within the chest, causing stomach cold; when the stomach is cold, one consumes cold foods and inhales cold air, all of which can enter the stomach."},{"anchor":"trans-15p","marker":"15p","type":"translation","text":"The kidney is the gateway of the stomach. When external cold directly invades the lesser yin kidney, it is referred to as \"middle cold.\" This is something that the \"Inner Canon\" hints at but does not explicitly state. One point is that its pulse is large and strong; although it is called \"middle cold,\" it does not indicate a complete disease. In cases of sudden disease caused by middle cold, the pulse must be weak. The \"Inner Canon\" comprehensively discusses the pulse patterns of cold due to invasion, hence it mentions the larger and vigorous pulse. Zhongjing categorizes cold damage as a heat disease and middle cold as a cold disease, explaining them separately. The pulse of cold damage generally features a large, floating, rapid, and slippery quality as yang, while a sinking, thick, weak, and subtle quality represents yin. If a yang pulse appears in a yang disease, it is indicative of death; consequently, in a sudden acute yin disease, there should be no return of a yang pulse. If it is merely large and vigorous, with two yang and one yin, why would there be sudden urgency? This is also something that the \"Inner Canon\" hints at but is difficult to discern. Furthermore, when Zhongjing describes sinking, thick, weak, and subtle pulses as yin, if cold damage transmits into the lesser yin channel, it is said that the pulse is weak and subtle. Now, in middle cold of the lesser yin, it must only refer to the weak pulse, not the subtle one. This is because \"weak\" pertains to the subtlety of yang, while \"subtle\" pertains to the delicateness of yin."},{"anchor":"trans-16p","marker":"16p","type":"translation","text":"When cold邪 affects the kidneys, the loss of yang and perhaps the loss of yin cannot be determined yet. When it reaches a state of extreme cold, there is only the loss of yang without the loss of yin; therefore, the pulse must not be thin. If a thin pulse is indeed felt, it indicates that the yin has already been depleted internally—how could it then recover? In the case of cold damage, only the lesser yin has a faint pulse, while other channels do not. The bladder of the greater yang is the organ of the lesser yin, and when a faint pulse is felt, there is aversion to cold. Thus, Zhongjing originally treated the lesser yin using aconite and ginger. The faint pulse and aversion to cold signify the approach of true yang is slight. As the poem states: \"That moon is faint, and this sun is faint; now these lowly people, too, grieve in sorrow.\" In the heavenly phenomena, yang cannot be weak; thus, can the yang within the human body be weak? With yin in the kidneys being abundant and yang being slight, cold is naturally generated from within, compounded by external cold cutting directly through. It may either bury yang within, leading to disaster, or push yang outward, causing one to be overwhelmed, often resulting in sudden death—hence, Zhongjing considered it a sudden illness. The physical body of a person is entirely yin. When the parents conceive, a single point of true yang is born first and stored within the two kidneys, from which the essence of life is generated, thus referred to as the source of vitality."},{"anchor":"trans-17p","marker":"17p","type":"translation","text":"Outside the six excesses, no evil dares to invade; thus, they are called the guardians against temptation. In a dark room, a single lamp shines brightly until dawn; the eyes and ears rely on it for clarity, the hands and feet depend on it for action. In ancient times, people braved the snow and cold, seeking poetry and friends, yet they still spoke of a fleeting moment of inspiration. As for achieving merit in distant lands or enduring hardships like biting cold, how often does one forget internal cold while facing external cold? Therefore, by cultivating the innate with the acquired, one can enjoy it for a hundred years. If not, the slightest yang will surely lead to an excess of yin, and as yin increases, yang will further decrease. If the outer cold suddenly arrives, and one relies on habitual methods for treatment, what are the chances that one in a hundred will survive? Is the essence of illness contained within this? The true yang in the kidneys is supported by water, remaining attached and unseparated; it is confined by earth, hiding and not revealing. Aside from release and drainage, it remains steadfast and unmoving. The yang of the hands and feet is employed to move throughout the body, protecting the pores and guarding the exterior; the yang in the spleen mirrors the strength of heaven, digesting food, distributing fluids, and operating internally; the yang in the chest reflects the regulation of the sun, illuminating the sky above, dissipating yin and removing gloom, proclaiming it upwards."},{"anchor":"trans-18p","marker":"18p","type":"translation","text":"These three elements represent abundance and prosperity; the true yang in the kidneys enjoys tranquility and peace, hence it is possible for an eighty-year-old to father a child, and those with remaining vigor can still engage in commerce. Even if one indulges excessively, leading to impotence and lack of use, one can still prolong the years. The crucial issue lies in the external and internal yang: when it weakens and becomes unresponsive, the yin energy begins to take precedence. If the skin is cold and lacks warmth, it may lead to stiff muscles; the external yang is no longer functional. If digestion fails, one may experience nausea, diarrhea, and bloating; the internal yang of the spleen is not working. If there is obstruction in the chest, it can result in blockage and tightness; the yang within the chest is not functioning. Then, one may resort to the yang sealed by water and earth, taking on responsibilities, and while the head receives some yang and turns red, the skin may suffer damage and dryness, and the spleen and stomach may obtain yang but not be free from cold; how can one endure long? In the presence of cold and a slight yin, strict measures must be taken to eliminate the faint yang, leading to skin that is frozen and cold, devoid of sweat and spirit. It is urgent to use Aconite and dried ginger along with scallions to disperse the cold, and add pig bile to direct it into the yin. However, if there is concern that the medicinal power may not suffice, one should apply hot scallions and moxa to attack both externally and internally, which is essential to break the hard obstruction.

It is necessary to stop the sweating, sharply administer the aforementioned medicines, and continuously reinforce the protection of the pores. Otherwise, there is a risk that the yang may be further depleted. This is a challenging situation. Using aconite and ginger to counteract yin and restore yang is akin to cavalry breaking through a siege, raising flags to rally the scattered yang, thereby facilitating its reunion. Those who do not understand this principle will increase the dosage of medicines and mix them into a decoction, inadvertently restraining the force that should penetrate, making the effort slow and ineffective. This poses another difficulty. Moreover, in the initial medicines, one must prioritize adding angelica and cinnamon to address the vitality. Since cold pathogens invade, they first damage the blood of the vital organs. Otherwise, if the medicines focus solely on defending the exterior, without benefiting the interior, they will not be appropriate for the ailment, and the pathogen will not be entirely eliminated, leading to a lack of favorable outcome.

Further, it is essential to add astragalus, white atractylodes, five-flavored fruit, and white peony to equally supplement both yin and yang without pause. The heaviness of yin may show a sign of decline, like a prodigal son returning home; at this moment, if one is unsteady and neglects the necessary follow-up, they will surely squander previous accomplishments. This is the sixth difficulty. By using a combination of medicines to cultivate yin and protect yang, it is understood that the person may already possess heat-phlegm, and yang has long transformed into cold from yin. At this point, although the intangible yin cold may be dispersed, the tangible cold phlegm blocking the passages cannot abruptly convert to heat. Therefore, while ginger and aconite can be omitted, all cold and cooling components like ox gall and bamboo mucus must not be used.

How can one seek to achieve results through effort, only to let the disease persist while the medicine remains, thus giving rise to other ailments, leaving no peace?

A skilled practitioner must exert effort; this way, the method may become clear and actionable. However, the unrefined and rigid practitioners will surely not succeed; ignorant individuals who are poorly informed will inevitably be filled with doubts and fears about taking medicine.

Danxi stated: Those who are suffering from internal cold have suddenly been exposed to cold, and their illnesses arise violently. People with internal cold, due to their pores being relaxed, receive evil influences all over their body. It becomes difficult to differentiate along the meridians, and there is no heat to disperse; they must be treated with warming and tonifying remedies.

Cold and heat are like water and fire; they cannot be treated the same way, as this can be deadly, so one must be cautious! Note that Yuanli is an esteemed physician of the current dynasty. Regarding middle cold, he has grasped the broad concept but has not understood the deeper principles. He incorrectly states that treating it as a heat disease will lead to death, which is a significant misunderstanding of the principle of treatment.

For every yin disease that a physician can remedy, one calamity can be avoided, as it aligns with the laws of heaven and humanity. If one cannot resolve sudden illness but seeks to escape calamity, it is unattainable. In the world, there are many fortunate individuals; how should they choose their methods? The Six Indications of Color and Pulses: A color of coldness must manifest as blue, for blue is associated with the liver. Therefore, Zhongjing said: if the tip of the nose is blue and there is pain in the abdomen, one with severe cold will die. This refers to the Shao Yin coexisting with the cold of the kidney water; extreme cold leads to the loss of yang, and the loss of yang leads to death. If the lips and mouth are blue and the body cold, it indicates imminent death. The five organs belong to yin, which store essences and house spirits. When blood and qi are obstructed by cold evils, the genuine essence of the organs cannot circulate, leading to the loss of spiritual function, blocking the paths of rising and falling, entry and exit, with the absence of nourishment causing the lips and mouth to appear blue. The \"Spiritual Pivot\" states: if the foot's Jue Yin energy ceases, the lips turn blue. The liver stores blood, so when qi is obstructed, it is evident that nourishment is cut off. If the pulse is absent, it indicates imminent death; if the pulse returns, one recovers. Absent means gone."},{"anchor":"trans-24p","marker":"24p","type":"translation","text":"The meridians are the conduits of the organs. When pressured by cold, the vital energy escapes from the meridians, leading to death if it enters the internal organs, but healing occurs if it enters the internal cavities. The text states: when blood and vital energy flow together upward, it results in sudden death by great collapse. The \"upward\" refers to the middle jiao, which is a cavity, and does not fully point to the internal organs. Similarly, if an evil influence obstructs the five collaterals, resembling a state of death, treatment involves restoring the circulation of blood in the meridians. This pertains mainly to the channels in the head and face; restoring the circulation of blood there results in healing and does not solely imply the internal cavities. Thus, the escape of the meridian's energy into the organs or cavities indicates certain signs. The obstruction of blood and energy in the upper part indicates symptoms of disease. Careful examination and consideration of these factors will clarify life or death outcomes. If the middle cold causes the pulse to disperse, it results in death. Indeed, if the energy escapes inward, it disperses outward. The inward escape still distinguishes between the organs, while the outward escape results in a complete loss of Yang and cannot be regained. When the pulse at the wrist is slow, stagnant, and fine, it signifies cold in the lower jiao.

When cold originates internally, it affects the organs and manifests at the surface, leading to chills, aversion to cold, or symptoms of reversal and spasm. In summary, heat is often associated with excess, while cold is frequently linked to deficiency.

A certain officer, Dong Yancheng, aged over forty, due to excessive labor, experienced incessant thirst and drank excessively of cold milk, which led to diarrhea, intestinal rumbling, and abdominal pain. His limbs were cold, he had cold sweats, and his breath was also cold. The six pulses were like spider silk, and he occasionally felt faint.

The condition of the officer cannot be cured unless a significant prescription is utilized for urgent treatment.

His body was cold, his mouth and nose were also cold, and he had a cool sweat on his forehead. At times, he felt dizzy, and his pulse was faint like spider silk. One physician diagnosed him with a wind condition and wanted to use the Xuanfeng Powder to dispel it. I recalled the discussion on the creation of Xuanfeng Powder for children by the Qian family, noting that internal damage to the spleen and stomach in children could lead to either vomiting or diarrhea, and if prolonged, the wind pathogen could become lodged in the stomach, causing diarrhea. There are knots within the powder, leading to concern over lingering shock, thus the Xuanfeng Powder was used to guide out the wind pathogen. The Inner Canon states: \"Prolonged wind causes food poisoning,\" which is exactly what this refers to.

Qibo explained: The energy of fainting rises and the cold accumulates in the chest without being expelled. If it is not expelled, warm energy departs, leaving only cold, thus resulting in internal cold. Dongyuan commented: This is due to insufficient spleen and stomach, overexertion of the body, and the central Qi being affected by illness, leading to cold accumulation. Therefore, it is necessary to tonify Yang. Thus, I prescribed a modified formula of Lichong Decoction with black Aconite, taking five qian each time, and commonly using scallion white to stew mutton soup, taking the clear broth in a large cup at the prescribed times. By evening, the limbs gradually warmed and there was slight sweating. I repeated it late at night. The following day, one's spirit revived, and the pulses were strong. After several doses, it was cured. I recall Li Sishun saying: The symptom is the evidence; the disease manifests internally, while the symptoms appear externally.
