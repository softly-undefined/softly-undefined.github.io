<p><strong>Arts and Literature</strong></p>
<p><strong>Praise for the Biography of Bian Que and Cang Gong</strong> [Han, Sima Qian]</p>
<p>The Grand Historian said: Women have no true beauty or ugliness, yet in the palace, they are prone to jealousy; scholars possess neither virtue nor vice, but when entering the court, they are seen with suspicion. Hence, Bian Que faced calamity due to his skills, and Cang Gong then hid away and accepted punishment, while Ti Ying communicated through letters, allowing their father to regain peace. Thus, Laozi said: “Beautiful things are vessels of misfortune,” can we say that Bian Que is among them? Those like Cang Gong could be considered to be closer to this idea.</p>
<p><strong>Preface to the Artistic Literature Section of the Book of Han</strong> [Han, Ban Gu]</p>
<p>The medical canon originates from the understanding of human blood, vessels, marrow, yin and yang, to identify the root of illnesses and the distinction between life and death. It involves the proper application of acupuncture, stones, herbs, and heat, harmonizing various medications according to their appropriateness. The acquisition of benefits is like that of using a kind stone to extract iron, utilizing materials accordingly. Those who are unskilled may misunderstand the principles, mistaking recovery for severity, and life for death. The classical formulas are based on the temperature of herbs and stones, assessing the depth of illnesses, using the taste of medicine, tailored to the response of the body, distinguishing between the five bitter and six pungent flavors, balancing water and fire to unblock and resolve issues, restoring harmony. If one loses their appropriateness, they might exacerbate heat with heat or cold with cold, injuring their essence internally, which is a unique loss. Hence, it is said: “There are illnesses that go untreated but often result in the use of traditional Chinese medicine.”<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>Those skilled in the art of healing are essential tools for life, serving as a safeguard of royal authority. In ancient times, there were Qi Bo and Yu Fu; in the middle ages, there were Bian Que and Qin He. They addressed illness and governance, using diagnosis to understand administration. During the rise of the Han dynasty, there was Cang Gong, yet today, his techniques are obscure. Therefore, I discuss his texts to introduce the art of healing.</p>
<p>Encouragement for Physicians: In the realm between heaven and earth, humanity is the most intelligent. What people value most is life. Although lifespans vary, whether short or long, the whims of temperature and appetite lead to different ailments, causing untimely death; thus, neglecting one’s nature can destroy health. The key to rescuing from these afflictions truly lies in effective prescriptions. Therefore, it is crucial for the esteemed physician to be well-versed in the classics, as the great masters are honored as the kings of medicine. Just as the enlightened one can alleviate suffering, they can only treat the disruptions of the four elements. There are also poets who praise the beauty of Pengcheng, the gentleness of the Qin state, the encounter of Ji Liang with the Lu family, and the meeting of Guo Zi with the people of Yue. </p>
<p>Finally, with the long-lasting pursuit of immortality and the wondrous path, one can still transform the six into one using golden elixirs and refine the three into seven using silver pills. They gather secrets in jade boxes and explore the profound wisdom of ancient texts. What is peach gum? The Northern Dipper cannot hide its form.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>The golden paste is not far; the bright pearl is still ashamed of its price. It can make the sounds of the drums resonate beneath the door of the family business, and even beside the solemn offerings, the sound of the flute lingers. In the Zhou Li, the physician is in charge of the ailments of the people; for every citizen who is ill, they are treated in accordance with their afflictions. At the end of the year, each physician records their treatments and submits them, to know what has healed and what has not, as a caution for future practice. </p>
<p>As for studying the essence of the original principles, and examining the Confucian traditions, one may spend all day in clear discussions and all night in rigorous study. At the beginning of learning, one may still cling to flattery; as one accumulates achievements, only then does one earn the title of teacher. With the passing of days and months, one can be called a scholar of great learning; even after mastering the classics, one still needs deep discussions. The net of knowledge must be wide, and the hooks of understanding must be deep; if one is satisfied and not awake, then the days are simply not enough.</p>
<p>Moreover, when composing poetry, one must often discern the essence, whether ancient or modern, refined or popular, everything must be observed closely, with a detailed understanding of what to take and what to leave behind; then the beautiful phrases may emerge, and the exquisite cadence will come to life.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>Can one master poetry without guidance from texts, or understand the Book of Changes without discussing it? Yangzi Yun said: &quot;Read a thousand poems, and then you can write poetry.&quot; How much more so for the path of medicine, where the nine divisions of diagnosis are quite intricate, and understanding the properties of a hundred medicines is difficult. Observing colors and discerning sounds, their effectiveness is deeply secret; in autumn, ailments can be subtle, and in summer, sufferings are hard to identify. When compared to the practitioners, there has never been thorough agreement or discussion; often, in youth, scholars skim the surface, knowing vaguely that licorice is sweet and cassia is spicy, thinking this is enough for their practice. Yet, the established methods are disregarded; they read Zhuangzi in the same year, while others favor the Book of Changes. However, when patients seek my help, I still cannot fully achieve the desired treatment, even if I cannot reach the source, it can still benefit myself. Therefore, if there are no barriers of social status, and one diligently enhances their knowledge with past experience, they can indeed unravel the complexities. Daily learning what is lacking, one can compose brilliant techniques, yet I would still say it cannot be done.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>There are many who treat illnesses, but they often respond carelessly and indiscriminately. Those who truly care for others are rare. Thus, one may spend days traversing various methods and months honing countless techniques, yet they have never truly respected the efficacy of their medicines, leaving matters of life and death to chance. Their superficial accomplishments are of no real value. When love runs deep among kin, and feelings are intense, but ailments arise in critical areas, and diseases manifest severely, even if one wishes to exert their full efforts to heal, they find that there are no results. Why is this? It is because they lack foundation in these matters and are thus difficult to change. </p>
<p>Certain herbs like hu ma (flaxseed) can only alleviate headaches, while others like mai qu (barley) and qiong huan (spicebush) may counteract specific ailments. If one fails to recognize their place and is constrained by their circumstances, how can they hope to resuscitate the dead in the capital and gain fame among the elite? Such aspirations are unattainable. The path of healing is genuinely challenging—this is a stark reality. </p>
<p>It is indeed necessary to contemplate these thoughts and elevate what is good. This is not only about leaving a name for future generations; it is also an act of profound merit. Comparing it to freeing a single pigeon on a scale or reviving ten thousand fish in a pond is not something that can be discussed in the same breath.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>On Medicine</strong> by Li Hua (Tang Dynasty)</p>
<p>The Duke of Jin was planning to invade Qin, but soon fell ill. The Duke of Qin sent a physician, He, to examine him. Before he set off, he cautioned, &quot;With neighboring countries in conflict, how can a physician proceed with his task?&quot; He replied, &quot;I do not dispense medicine or herbs; I will use words to cure the Duke of Jin so that the nation suffers no harm.&quot; The Duke of Qin was pleased and honored him with a grand send-off.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Jin, the physician found the Duke in a luxurious setting, surrounded by more than a hundred attendants adorned in jewels, while chefs prepared feasts in the courtyard before inviting guests. The physician declined, saying, &quot;I was commissioned by my lord to remedy your illness. Now, the great country has turned to appearances and meals to treat me; this is beyond my capacity.&quot; The military officials replied, &quot;This is how our lord honors you, not an oversight, please respect our customs.&quot; The physician said, &quot;I have journeyed a thousand miles at great physical strain and lack energy. All I desire is one cup of wine, a dish of fruit, and some light side dishes to accompany my meal; I don&#39;t wish to burden your great country with more.&quot; </p>
<p>Having respectfully accepted their offerings, he examined the Duke and said, &quot;Your voice is hoarse and waning, your energy is turbulent and superficial, your complexion is cold yet your build is robust. You are akin to the King of Chu; this can either be remedied or not.&quot;<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>The Duke of Jin said: &quot;What is the situation of the Duke of Chu in relation to me?&quot; The guest replied: &quot;I once visited Chu. Its territory is vast and rich, with mountains, rivers, forests, and marshes stretching beyond the Huai River all the way to the South Sea. Jin cannot compete with Qi and Qin.&quot; The Duke of Jin said: &quot;I have never ventured into Chu and am unfamiliar with its king. I wish to hear about that country.&quot; The guest said: &quot;Your Grace, I do not recall delving into the details of Chu&#39;s boundaries either; I can only speak of what I have seen. Chu is near the outskirts, about three hundred miles from Ying. If you drive a cart up the hill, you can see the various palaces; the red and white hues illuminate the heavens, yet you cannot see the sky above. Like floating water, half is within; the waves of the vast water sway, rising and falling with the wind. The majestic southern peaks, pine trees are everlasting; sometimes lurking, sometimes rising, creating a varied landscape of heights and depths. Flowing clouds shift in weight, at times vanishing, at times brightening; the roads stretch and wind, surrounding mountains and rivers. The cart covers seems like a pavilion as you ascend the high ground; the red sky looms overhead, and you raise your hand to touch the heavens. What appeared high is now beneath the cart; the dark valley is shrouded, stones thrown make no sound. Describing its inner pastures, the mountains darkly frame the doors, with a hazy and jagged view, as if strong blades and curtains were to come apart and come together again. Dew seals the gaps in the rock, sounds small as they come, yet resonate loudly in response. The cliffs are steep and bathed in sunlight, piercing through the horizon as clouds hover.&quot;<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>By the riverside, the grass stretches for a hundred miles, often covered in white sands, the sun scorches bright and glaring; the green fields extend endlessly, rising and falling with the hills; groves of fragrant trees, orange and grapefruit, abound; rich in primal energy, summer and winter feel the same; shadows do not let the wind pass through, and the quiet does not let the sun leak in; monkeys and gibbons leap and frolic, displaying many forms; their calls echo, from dawn till dusk; petals fall like snow, covering the path; looking all around, no one is in sight, stepping forward, my feet sink; yellow birds sing occasionally, while white pheasants fly across; by the dangerous edge, I gaze at the river, where the bank becomes a pool; serene and still, there are always spirits and wonders, turtles and fish swim, revealing scales and shells; slender grass sways, the wind stirs the waves; crashing waves burst forth, their force unstoppable.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>In fear and awe, the spirit shudders; hair stands on end. Climbing trees, eyes closed, still dreading falling into springs. The decayed mountains are sparse and vast, while the thick source roars in the nose. Branching streams ripple, converging in deep currents; day and night there is sound, cool against the heat. Through cliffs, rushing torrents rush forth and leap away; initially thought reachable, suddenly seeming boundless. Whirling and sliding, swirling in eddies; stones rolling against fortifications, fire igniting on the riverbanks. Confirmed as tamed and yet turbulent, sand spilling into waves; white smoke faintly blue, waters stretching into view. Faintly vibrant, lasting long enough to form boundaries; soft rain falls, clouds rise in the dark. Spring is born in the Yuan and Xiang rivers, evening arrives in Cangwu; sound and silence end, color follows the distant gaze. Water plants and lotus flowers create a delicate embroidery across the river. Astonished by the multitude of bird names, they disperse and unite upon the water; drifting downstream, sometimes resisting the waves to return. Roaring and terrifying like thunder, clouds rise and churn; neither harms the other, appearances are serene in leisurely grace. By the riverbank, they repeatedly observe, reflecting the river into a rosy haze; clear water ripples, with depths revealing sand; beside the corridors, overflow drenches the railings. Above are fair maidens, soft sounds entering the clouds. As dusk deepens and is about to vanish, following the drifting wind, the sounds are heard once more.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The music of Qi, Song, Zheng, and Wei resounded in the palace; striking gold and hitting stone caused grass and trees to flourish. Strong city walls crumbled, towering mountains collapsed; birds and beasts were frightened, and the Huai Lake boiled over. Adornments worth thousands were worn, a meal could feed a thousand households. It is disgraceful not to be connected, measured by grains; the stores of grain were half that of commoners; the expenses for feeding horses doubled the rent collected. The remaining lavish wealth and extravagant maintenance were on par with this. The King of Chu was very secure, yet the people of Chu were very ill; Shén Shūqǐ aged but did not engage in governance. Before finishing his words, the Duke of Jin let out a breath and stretched his hand, saying: &quot;Sir, your good fortune is indeed possible, why is that?&quot; The guest replied: &quot;This is not enough to burden Chu, hence I say it is possible. But if it expands endlessly, then it is not possible.&quot; The Duke of Jin’s countenance changed, strength surged within him; he dismissed the attendants, withdrew the meal shamefully, and requested, saying: &quot;Sir, you finally mention the ills of your humble servant, I am fortunate to have heard this.&quot;<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>The guest, riding at the right time, said: &quot;The ruler of Chu has sent the Commandant Sima to manage the troops at the northern border, threatening our city. The young nobles of the city petitioned to open the gates for battle, while the elder ones advised that the ruler must prioritize the well-being of the people. Chu relies on its wealth and strength, and indulges in desires that are not sufficiently frightening. The ruler then mobilized resources to provide aid to the borders, while the smaller rulers sought to ensure supplies for the four seasons. The ruler remarked: &#39;This aid is given by people and returned to people; without people, there would be none of this. What is there to cherish?&#39; He then ordered the senior nobles to distribute money to the people and express gratitude, saying: &#39;I am unworthy, causing your fathers and brothers not to protect themselves against the army of Chu, which is why I have exhausted all efforts for you.&#39; The people of Qin, moved by the ruler&#39;s words, wept, and even women and daughters requested to take revenge on Chu. Upon hearing this, the court of Chu withdrew its army by evening. Both ruler and ministers were deeply shocked and accepted their roles under Qin; this was the method of the former kings who did not engage in warfare. The Duke of Jin was perplexed by the events in Chu and, consequently, ceased plotting against Qin. Thus, the great nations established friendly relations while the smaller ones came to pay homage, leading all under heaven to submit. The guest indeed healed Jin with his words, hence it is said he spoke as a physician.&quot;<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>The &quot;Zhou Guan&quot; states that physicians are responsible for treating the illnesses of the people. Generally, any affliction one suffers can be cured, but if left untreated for too long, it may lead to death. One has yet to observe an illness that cannot be cured. In the regions of Ba and Chu, there is a custom of consulting spirits, which has existed since ancient times. When the five elements are in disarray, causing the suffering of severe plagues, it is often said that these are illnesses brought by the seasons and not something medicine can address. Therefore, they pray to the spirits without rest, offering chicken, pig, duck, and sheep in hopes of receiving bountiful blessings. If they cannot recover, they blame themselves for the spirits not coming to aid; if they are fortunate enough to heal, they attribute it to their diligent prayers and numerous offerings. Otherwise, how could they contend with the elements? </p>
<p>Moreover, if treatment is delayed, the poison of the illness gradually affects the entire household. Thus, even close friends and relatives dare not approach each other&#39;s homes, fearing the spread of infection; children fear their parents, and wives avoid their husbands. Wealthy individuals may still manage to have a shaman protect them, while the poor are left to suffer alone in silence. In such circumstances, not only is the charity of medicine cut off, but even food supplies are also scarce. As a result, those who die are often around eighteen or nineteen, yet the people remain oblivious to the causes.</p>
<p>I once inquired about this with others, and it turned out the real issue was the dominance of shamans over physicians. Alas! Can shamans truly surpass all physicians? What they conquer are merely the easily misled common folk. For illnesses are rooted within the body, while spirits lurk outside. Good medicine is meant to treat internal afflictions.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Now, if one does not address the ailments within but solely seeks fortune from without, when the situation becomes dire, it is inappropriate to neglect the need for care and inquiry; would this not be a mistake? If crops in flourishing fields are damaged by pests, one must completely eliminate the pests for the crops to thrive. If a household has valuable possessions but thieves invade, the owner must wield weapons to either kill or capture the intruders to protect their wealth. The same is true for the human body: when confronted with the influences of yin and yang and facing illness, one should have a physician examine the sounds, look at the color, check the pulse, and prescribe medicine to address the internal organs, allowing the body to return to equilibrium. If one avoids seeking medical treatment and expects to reap the rewards without eliminating the pests, or seeks to preserve their wealth without driving away thieves, it is utterly unattainable. How much more so for the state, which values medical texts as the utmost priority.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>During the Yuan Dynasty, the renowned editor Ming Fang issued guidelines for the imperial regions, detailing the conditions of epidemics in meticulous fashion. Later, during the Qingli period, the virtuous Minister Fan Wenzheng suggested that physicians from the capital and other regions gather for lectures and training to improve their skills, thereby eliminating errors and saving lives, which would truly assist in effective governance. However, the common people were unaware of the court&#39;s benevolent intentions and instead fell prey to false beliefs, endangering their lives, which was genuinely lamentable. Now, the doctors and scholars are instructed to study the methods of ancient figures like Shen Nong and Bian Que, and come together in the teachings of Qi Bo and Yu Shi to correct wrong practices and eliminate falsehoods, ensuring that treatable diseases do not harm people, thus contributing to the welfare of the populace. Yet, there is concern for the customs of the Ba Cong people, who remain attached to old ways and do not appreciate the miraculous effects of medicine, excessively praying to misguided deities; hence, inscriptions are made to convey this.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>Medical Inscription</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty - Lü Huai)</strong></p>
<p>In the Jin dynasty, there was a man named Wu Tai who was skilled in medicine. A local official presented a memorial, and he was appointed as the chief physician, after which he returned to his hometown to establish a temple in honor of the Holy Marquis. Having mastered his art, he returned to express gratitude to his teacher and sought to broaden his knowledge, displaying a commendable ambition.</p>
<p>At that time, I had been exiled and was serving as an official in Puzhong. After fulfilling my duties, I sought to document my thoughts in the temple, and thus I created this medical inscription to commend his dedication and fulfill his aspirations. I knew that what I shared could nourish his goodness.</p>
<p>The inscription states:<br>The six qi and five elements are the essence of life; the three regions and nine pulses converge in harmony. In ancient times, there were unique techniques that cleansed the intestines and washed the stomach, using acupuncture to relieve ailments. Observing the roots of the pulse allows one to anticipate and conquer without direct confrontation, to preserve life.</p>
<p>Healing the illnesses of the world is akin to holding the reins of a nation, always ensuring that harmful elements do not interfere with righteousness. One must dedicate oneself fully; the heart&#39;s deep troubles will surely arise, and if one benefits from the art, even the smallest detail can lead to profound results. Wu Tai was proactive, never forgetting his teacher, weighing the importance of righteousness against personal gain, and being cautious in his practice.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>

<p>In a record from the public hall:</p>
<p>When I first lived in my hometown, there was a person who had a cold and a cough. They consulted the physicians, who believed it to be a case of &quot;poison&quot; and treated him with lethal methods, taking a hundred gold coins for the treatment. They administered poison medicine that attacked his stomach and intestines, burned his skin, and prohibited him from enjoying delicious food. After a month, a hundred ailments arose, with internal heat vexing coldness, and the cough persisted without end—the symptoms were truly those of poison. </p>
<p>I sought out another physician, who thought it was heat and prescribed cold medicine. He vomited in the morning and had diarrhea by night, thus he could no longer eat. In fear, he regressed; his symptoms, including severe headaches and various other ailments, worsened, and after trying three doctors, the condition became even more dire. </p>
<p>An old man in the village told him: This is the fault of the physician, the excess of medicine! What sickness have you? In life, one relies primarily on qi (vital energy) and secondarily on food. Now, you are consuming medicine all day long, with foul smells overwhelming, while a hundred poisons battle within you. You exhaust your primary source and neglect your supplementary source, and that is why you are ill. Retreat and rest, thank the physician, reject the medicine, and indulge in what you enjoy; when your vitality is restored and your food satisfying, then good medicine can yield effective results in just one drink. Following this, after a month, his illness completely healed.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Medicine Recitation [by an Unknown Author]</strong></p>
<p>Ji Zhongzan expressed his concealed resentment in poetry, knowing it was unavoidable. He ultimately said: &quot;In the mountains of Caiwei, with hair unbound, I forever howl and sing, nourishing my nature for longevity, lamenting the unfulfilled aspirations.&quot; Sima Jingwang regretted killing Zhongzan, wishing he had felt that remorse before the act. Had Zhongzan escaped death, it would be like a rabbit fleeing into the woods, disappearing from the realm of men. Was it really so difficult to venture into the mountains of Caiwei? Master Sun wrote about severe illnesses, stating that dozens of immortals attained their path due to ailments. Why? By discarding worldly burdens and nurturing a spirit like that of Yingyang, they turned misfortune into fortune. I was exiled to the border and, unintentional in my survival, knew I would not die after a year without further orders. However, my old suffering from hemorrhoids has since worsened, with my groans lasting hundreds of days. The earth offered no remedies, and those available proved ineffective. A Daoist advised me to avoid rich flavors and eliminate blood toxins for purity&#39;s triumph over excess.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>Hemorrhoids have parasites, lingering in my rear, their taste taints the blood. They sustain themselves by feeding on me. From today onward, day and night, I shall eat only light noodles of four liang, still I shall think of food, adding sesame and Poria to it. Outside of meals, I shall not take even a kiss. When the host is emaciated, the guest will abandon him. I fear that habits may easily change, thus I take the words of the Zhong San Zhen Ren as medicine for the illness, so that one may recite it three times a day, saying: &quot;Dongpo, scholar! Have you forgotten the worries of years gone by, the pains of a hundred days? If misfortune brings you the calamity of Zhong San, the sickness of Bo Niu, though you wish to gather wild vegetables and let your hair down, how could that be possible?&quot; Now, there is much sesame and wheat, Poria as well. The scholar will sing in response: &quot;In the matter of doing non-doing, a hundred affairs are governed; in the taste of tastelessness, the five flavors are all present. Poria and sesame, sometimes scarce, sometimes available to eat, and whenever they are not, I shall not care. Alas! The guest does not stay, and for this I feel ashamed.&quot;<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>On Sending Off Doctor Xia</strong></p>
<p>I have often lamented that the discussions by people in the world tend to disregard the ancient wisdom, insisting that matters of today need not stem from the past, nor align with tradition. However, upon observing Doctor Xia&#39;s medical practices, I have realized this is certainly not the case. Doctor Xia&#39;s methods and prescriptions are extraordinary and peculiar, almost seeming detached from human emotions, yet they frequently yield effective results. When I inquired about his reasoning, he consistently referenced the classics and investigated historical precedents, showing that he is not without foundation. This stirred my thoughts, so I wrote this piece to convey my faith in his methods to the present age, and to admonish my peers who neglect ancient teachings and rely solely on their own ideas.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>Discussion with Yang Yuanfu on the Diagnosis of Liang Kuangfu&#39;s Illness</p>
<p>Liang Kuangfu: The right flank relates to the lungs; coughing and spitting blood, accompanied by shortness of breath, indicates lung conditions; if there is a fever, rapid pulse, and inability to eat, it signifies that fire is attacking metal, resulting in deficiency of both the lung and spleen. When both the lung and spleen are deficient and fire invades, the illness manifests in reverse, thus it is improper to use tonifying or purging methods. Fortifying metal would mean that metal and fire clash, worsening cough and shortness of breath; purging fire would result in fire not retreating, and nodules would exacerbate. The correct approach is to initially support the vital energy with the Ren Shen Bai Du San and then add a small amount of active illness remedy. I have heard that this remedy has been used without effect, suggesting that the condition is severely reversed and the medication has not reached its target. One should discuss thoroughly with Kuangfu; as autumn cools, recovery may be possible. The pulse condition tends to resist the fiery energy of spring and summer, while it recedes in autumn and winter. It is advisable to only use the tonifying soup while adjusting according to the seasonal variations of yin and yang, the rising and falling, the floating and sinking, the warming and cooling, and the evidence seen for increasing or decreasing dosages. Follow the natural flow for rising and falling, and counteract for warming and cooling. To treat effectively, harmonize what is harmonious. If there is a sensation of energy stagnation, intermittently take a modified Zhi Zhu pill; if there is a problem with diet, intermittently take a specific Zhi Zhu soup. After several months, the reversed energy may begin to subside, making treatment methods applicable.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>However, I fear that today, if the complexion turns blue or red, and the pulse is thin or full, it will be hopeless. In recent discussions on medicine, there are those who follow Liu of Hejian and those who follow Zhang of Yizhou. Zhang’s approach to medication adjusts according to the four seasons and the yin-yang balance, aligning with the principles of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; regarding the regulation of spirit and the four energies. A physician who does not understand this acts recklessly. Liu’s method focuses on innovation and the removal of any stagnation, adhering to the principle of preserving the natural order without harm. A physician ignorant of this lacks the art. However, those who adhere to Zhang may not fully grasp his profundity, leading them to avoid decisive treatments, resulting in many missing opportunities for recovery. Those who follow Liu may not fully comprehend his essence, risking hasty actions that harm the vital energy and create problems for the future. If one can utilize the strengths of both schools without the drawbacks, then healing is likely attainable! Concerning the condition of Kuanfu, the initial symptoms must be profound, as the inflicted area cannot fully discharge at the moment, leading to stagnation and the emergence of new conditions, persisting until now. One might also consider following Liu’s principle of innovation, adding some discharging herbs to the medicinal formula for invigorating Qi, which may provide a gradual relief. This is my humble opinion, and I do not presume it to be certain; I merely wish for the talented Yuanfu to discuss and deliberate together.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Reading Pharmacy Books: A Ruminative Record by Liu Yin</strong></p>
<p>Human beings possess this essence, and with it, their bodies, consisting of the five organs and bones, resonate and allow the vital energy to flow. The sounds, colors, and tastes that connect to human senses such as mouth, nose, ears, and eyes may seem superficial, yet they fundamentally interact with similar essences within us and become harmonized; whereas, those that are dissimilar invariably clash. Even within a single person, one cannot fully grasp this. For instance, when taking medicine, if one uses the powdered remains of decayed wood and bones mixed as a potion, each will indeed align with their corresponding essences. Therefore, the underlying principle is the same. Thus, the ancients said: the flavor of wood is sour; its roots beneath the earth resemble bones, hence bones are nourished by sourness. The flavor of metal is pungent; metals intertwine with various substances resembling tendons, thus tendons are nourished by pungency. Salty represents water and resembles veins; bitter represents fire and resembles Qi; sweet represents earth and resembles flesh. Their forms are inherently aligned with their categories, so how could their essences not flow together? Expanding on this, the principles of fortune and misfortune relate likewise to good and evil.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>Heaven creates each person for this world, and each person can indeed manage their affairs; they are sufficient in themselves and do not rely on others. In Lingnan, there are many poisons, yet there are golden snakes and white medicines to cure them; in Hunan, there is much dampness, yet there are ginger, tangerine, and zhu yu to address the humidity. Fish and turtles, snails and clams, treat dampness and are born from water; musk deer and antelopes remedy stone toxins and are born from the mountains. If one cannot overcome the influences around them, then they cannot thrive within those influences. Things that coexist with certain energies must have purposes aligned with those energies. Just as Zhuzi stated, when heaven intends to send chaos, it must also produce individuals to restore order thereafter. From this perspective, there really are no useless individuals in the world, and people can indeed find their place in any situation.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>On the Transmission of Danxi by Dai Liang</strong></p>
<p>It is stated: In the past, Yin Junping of the Han was erudite and well-versed in all things. While he sold fortune-telling in Chengdu, when asked by people about immoral matters, he would rely on divination to elaborate on their advantages and disadvantages. He spoke to sons about filial piety, to younger brothers about obedience, and to subjects about loyalty. Historians noted that his principles and integrity were sufficient to inspire greed and sharpen social norms. The old man found the source of scholarly learning in Wuzhou and mingled with medicine. Those who came to him through medicine invariably received enlightenment that nourished their spirit and intellect. Every word and silence, every entrance and exit, in matters concerning ethics, he would particularly earnestly instruct, causing people to be moved, inspired, and vigorous in their efforts. Zuo Qiuming said: The words of a benevolent person are broadly beneficial! Truly! Such a person resembles the ancient sage known for his frankness and extensive knowledge, and they might also be regarded as a physician.</p>
<p><strong>Preface to the Gift for Jia Sicheng by Song Lian</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Jun from the same community wrote to me stating: In the autumn of the Renchen year, soldiers surged into Central China, and throughout the south of the Yangtze River, people faced chaos. At that time, Minister Bujia went to Eastern Zhejiang, carefully selecting talents, appointing them despite their official status, in order to safeguard a region. Although I am not talented, the Minister does not view me as inconsequential, allowing me to oversee the recording of affairs and serve as a judge. The role of a judge is to manage the governance and population of a city, and all strategies for defense, peace, and order are pursued tirelessly, day and night, to repay the Minister for his kindness. Nevertheless, the merits of my duties go unacknowledged, and as days turn into months, I have strained myself to the point of illness.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>At the onset of the illness, a great heat arose within my four limbs, followed by a fainting spell. When I recovered, my vision swirled, and I heard the sound of cicadas in my ears; my spirit felt absent, as if I were alone, detached from the crowd, like an eagle soaring in the vast sky, or a boat unmoored, drifting between the Three Gorges and the deep seas, unable to restrain myself. I heard of Master Zhu from Danxi, whose name was renowned everywhere, and urgently summoned him for treatment. When the master arrived, after taking my pulse, he said: &quot;Internally, your essence is shaken; externally, your form is strained, depleting your yin and consuming your vitality. You should withdraw your gaze and listen within the vast court of the Void; relying solely on medicine is not sufficient.&quot; He then instructed his senior disciple, Jia Junsicheng, to stay and take care of me. Jia treated me as if I were his own sibling, attending to my needs in every way. If he suspected my anger was excessive, he would treat me with sadness; if he thought I was too sad, he would treat me with joy; if my joy was excessive, he would address it with fear; if my fear was excessive, he would evoke contemplation; if my contemplation was excessive, he would counter it with anger.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>To the left and to the right, supporting and assisting, and then gently adjusting them. Furthermore, when there is a reversal, one applies medicine to the Yongquan point to awaken them; when they are in a state of stupor, one presses the Xin Yu point to stabilize them. Such treatment continues for several years; it cannot be abandoned overnight. Better to eat simple food and wear plain clothes than to go a day without Ji Jun. Better for scholars to be not reckless and for guests to be not noble than to go a day without Ji Jun. I then recovered from my illness, and Ji Jun has been greatly beneficial to me. I hope you can share a word to highlight Ji Jun&#39;s goodness and make it clear that I do not forget his kindness, though I do not know if it is appropriate. I have read Zhang Jun&#39;s letter and feel greatly moved by it. Those who govern the people in this world are often well-fed and indulge in pleasure.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Their view of our people is indifferent, as if the richness of Qin and Yue are not connected to each other; and not only are they not connected, but they also extract the marrow and cut the fat without knowing when to stop. Who is as diligent in caring for the people&#39;s ailments as Zhang Jun? The doctors of the world, with their many engagements, are too rushed to be gracious, often leaving without belief even after a single night; some have no time to check pulses or prescribe remedies, and cannot be retained. Who among them is like Jia Jun, who cares and nurtures for years without growing weary? All these can be recorded. I am now taking up my pen to follow in the footsteps of writers, and if I do not write about this, where can I find material to write about! Nevertheless, the officials today are cruel and oppressive, relentlessly beating and striking; my people have suffered this for far too long! As I look around, where are the wise leaders? Between states and towns, is there anyone with the skill to apply the right measures to revive the people? If there are such, though I am slow-witted, I could still prepare ink and brush, writing extensively and yet not pen a single word about it. This serves as a preface.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>In ancient times, physicians had to be well-versed in the texts of the three generations. The so-called three generations are: first, the &quot;Acupuncture and Moxibustion,&quot; second, the &quot;Shennong&#39;s Materia Medica,&quot; and third, the &quot;Great Fundamental Pulse Treatise.&quot; The pulse treatise is for observing evidence, the materia medica is for distinguishing drugs, and acupuncture and moxibustion are for eliminating diseases. Without these three, one cannot be called a physician. Therefore, it is said in the records of rituals: &quot;A physician who does not understand the three generations will not be trusted with their medicine.&quot; The transmitters of the classics clearly state their doctrines and refute the fallacies, using the concept of father and son passing down through three generations as a reference. How perplexing that is! The art of medicine requires deep contemplation, keen insight, and clarity of thought before one can engage with it. Even a father may not necessarily pass down his knowledge to his son.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is a physician named Yan, who has been in the medical profession for three generations. His medical practice focuses solely on major treatments, ignoring all else entirely. There is also Mr. Zhu Ping, whose family has historically practiced Confucianism, but he first gained recognition as a physician, diligently studying medical texts. A young man was afflicted with lung issues, coughing and producing blood-streaked phlegm. Yan said, &quot;This is a consumption; he will die in three months.&quot; Mr. Zhu disagreed, stating, &quot;No, the qi is rising and becoming abundant, but the central axis is lost; the fire organ is in turmoil, burning like gold in a furnace. This is called lung atrophy; treatment must be administered.&quot; Afterward, the young man indeed recovered.</p>
<p>An old man of sixty suffered from fevers and chills, initially experiencing a slight shiver, his teeth chattering, followed by severe heat, as intense as being steamed in a pot. Yan said, &quot;This is phlegm; if untreated, it will worsen.&quot; Mr. Zhu contradicted him, claiming, &quot;No, the pulse is excess and knotted, the rhythm is chaotic, with an exterior that seems strong but is internally weak; calamity emerges, yet fortune is found at the extreme. This is called the resolution.&quot;<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Medicine can cure, while without it, the condition worsens. Eventually, when it becomes severe, treatment can lead to recovery. A woman suffered from a cough and would expel several liters of phlegm, which smelled foul and affected anyone nearby. Yan stated that this was a cold-induced cough and recommended warmth. Pingjun disagreed. He noted that the balance of yin and yang was not achieved, resulting in stagnation of qi and blood, creating a situation with no resolution, which he termed a severe obstruction. If treated improperly, after a long time, the condition may stabilize but could still lead to the birth of a son. His statement proved true later on. Yan had been a physician for three generations, while Pingjun was just beginning, raising questions about the merit of their practices. </p>
<p>Alas! There were many renowned physicians in the past, too numerous to mention. Among them were Hua Yuanhua, Zhang Sibao, and Xu Zhizang, whose treatments and results were remarkable, and one never heard of their familial lineage passing down. Yet, for three thousand years, the interpretations of medical texts have clouded the principles of the &quot;Book of Rites,&quot; obscuring clarity. Those seeking medical help do not inquire about the profundity of the texts but follow practitioners they see persevering in their work, regardless of their expertise. When questioned, they say this is what the keepers of rituals suggest. Is this acceptable? </p>
<p>Ge Sheng, from a prominent family in Huai, was skilled in medicine and had studied the writings of three generations, practicing and mastering them. He treated ailments effectively, determining life or death with results as accurate as if he were consulting an unerring oracle. Scholars who might be unable to adequately provide medicine would nonetheless dispense it without seeking compensation, and the virtuous gentlemen would universally commend him. He was awarded the seventh rank robe and appointed to oversee the medical officers, with people relying on him for their lives. Oh! Is Ge Sheng not one who bears no shame before the ancient physicians?<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Preface to the Gift for Physician Jia</strong></p>
<p>The way of medicine has been difficult to articulate for a long time. However, one must carefully diagnose to establish measurement, set standards, weigh and balance, match colors and pulses, and observe the excesses and deficiencies, as well as the harmonious and contrary states. This must be coupled with the patient&#39;s movements and their breathing, after which one can treat them; thus, the matter is indeed of great seriousness. If one does not have a deep understanding of the gains and losses in the multitude of written works, can one still engage in this? </p>
<p>The &quot;Huangdi Neijing,&quot; although suspected to have been emulated and attributed to figures of pre-Qin times, contains profound words and deep meanings, and its examinations are credible and well-evidenced, making it a foundational text for physicians. Below this, we have texts from the people of Qin and Yue, which are gentle, yet there are no books to pass down. The work &quot;Bajiyi Nanjing&quot; by the Yue people primarily expounds upon the essentials of the &quot;Neijing.&quot; Further down, there are the teachings of Chunyu Yi and Hua Tuo, which are also part of the art of guiding. The practice of opening the abdomen to treat illnesses involves mystical elements. Sima Qian thoroughly documented the state of medical conditions, yet the so-called &quot;strange wind&quot; and &quot;mysterious wind&quot; are completely unknown to contemporary people, let alone searching for the profound meanings of treatment. Below this, we find Zhang Ji, whose &quot;Jinkui Yuhan Jing&quot; and discussions of typhoid diseases are indeed timeless classics. However, it primarily details injuries from the six qi and the resulting emotions, diet, and exertion, without thoroughly discussing these points, compounded by the difficulties in sequentially following the disordered and simplified text. Below him is Wang Shuhe.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>Uncle He compiled the &quot;Pulse Classic&quot; with Qi Bo, Hua Tuo, and others, discussing the principles of yin and yang, distinguishing the three divisions and nine conditions, categorizing the human greeting and vital energy, and detailing the twelve meridians along with the ailments of the three jiaos, five organs, and six bowels, making it exceedingly clear. Unfortunately, it was trivialized by some superficial individuals into a simplistic pulse song, preventing the original work from being widely disseminated. Following him was Chao Yuanfang, whose &quot;On the Source of Illnesses&quot; appears not to have been unwitnessed, as it discusses wind, cold, and two types of dampness, but neglects the topic of damp-heat, which is a flaw. Next was Wang Bing, who advanced the understanding of the changes in the five movements and six atmospheres, compiling the &quot;Heavenly Origin Jade Strategy,&quot; which is comprehensive and meticulous, yet difficult for people; should one cling too rigidly to it, they would become stagnant and disconnected. Following them were Wang Tao and Sun Simiao.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>Si Miao possessed exceptional knowledge and a compassionate heart. His works, such as the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; and &quot;Wings,&quot; include details on causes of harm to humans, which are expressed with deep fervor. Although later generations have ventured into his teachings, they may still leave gaps in their understanding of pathogenic fevers, leading to regrets. </p>
<p>Though Tao was lacking in skill, the &quot;Secret Essentials of the Outer Archives&quot; contained detailed discussions about the regulations of cautery and acupuncture, reflecting some ancestral teachings. However, the view that acupuncture can save the living but cannot revive the dead is somewhat biased. </p>
<p>Following him were Qian Yi, Pang Anshi, and Xu Shuwei. Xu Shuwei operated within set limits without making significant discoveries, while Anshi, although capable of remarkable adaptations, ultimately did not stray from established parameters; both men grasped the basics. Only Yi deeply explored the profound principles of acupuncture, extracting its essence and creating methods tailored for the five organs according to their specific needs.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>If the liver has excessive fire, it leads to leakage without nourishment; the kidneys, being true water, provide nourishment without leakage. This reveals the secrets of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; an understanding particularly important for those who know how to apply it. The world generally perceives it through the lens of infantile medicine, showing how shallow their understanding is. The writings that have been lost and collected by Yan Xiaozhong are largely influenced by his perspective and are not the original truth of the teachings. Below him are Zhang Yuanshu of Shanggu, Liu Wansheng of Hejian, and Zhang Congzheng of Suishui. Although Yuanshu and Wansheng set up unusual dreams and extraordinary figures to enhance their teachings, they were indeed inspired by the principles of the original teachings. Zhang Congzheng, on the other hand, is primarily a follower of Wansheng. </p>
<p>Yuanshu’s methods, which combined ancient formulas with new ailments, could not align with the past; he did not treat diseases according to formulas, which is why his writings did not circulate. What remains today has largely been shaped by later interpretations. The understanding of these principles has been deeply grasped by Dong Yuan and Li Gao. Gao clarified the internal and external injuries, placing significant emphasis on the importance of nourishing the spleen. He viewed the spleen as the central organ of the body, asserting that when it is balanced, all organs are balanced as well. Zhang Congzheng advocated for three methods involving vomiting, sweating, and purging for treatment, considering six critical factors of wind, cold, heat, damp, fire, and dryness—key aspects of medical practice. His treatments were often aggressive, and the remedies harsh; those unskilled in these methods risked causing death. Wansheng discussed diseases caused by wind and fire using the nineteen conditions from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which served as the basis for &quot;Original Disease Patterns.&quot; This was concise and profound, difficult for the majority of practitioners to emulate. Upon examining how these methods were established, they mostly revolved around the dual principles of replenishment and aggression.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Alas! Since the existence of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; there have been a total of one hundred seventy-nine physicians&#39; texts archived by the authorities, amounting to two hundred ninety works and two thousand two hundred fifty-nine volumes; this is indeed not a small number. He who has not yet had time for an in-depth discussion, I will address what is currently being discussed: Do the physicians of this world truly apply themselves fully to this? If they have not done so, how can they measure, establish standards, weigh, and assess pulse and color? It is nearly unimaginable that they would treat human life so lightly. Nevertheless, there is something essential here regarding the concepts of opposition and compliance. That which is called rising and falling, floating and sinking, I will follow; that which is called warming and cooling, cold and heat, I will oppose. If one can truly adhere to this principle, then even if one does not treat in the manner of the ancients, they will not stray far from the truth.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>Yet it is not easy to achieve in one fell swoop. If one does not seek to understand the vastness and interconnections, how can one suddenly return to the realm of simplicity? The difficulty in speaking of medicine lies precisely here. Wu Shang? Jia Sicong, the disciple of Lian, is of inherently gentle and upright nature, possessing the conduct of a gentleman. He once studied with Master Lian under the guidance of Mr. Wen from the southern city, learning to interpret the classics. After some time, Sicong left to pursue medical teachings at the door of Mr. Yanxiu Zhu. He explored all that was written by the Confucian scholars, and upon venturing out to treat ailments, often achieved remarkable results. Among the gentry, he frequently composed poetry and asked Lian for prefaces. If Lian was not knowledgeable about medicine, how could he be informed of Sicong’s achievements? Yet Sicong, tirelessly seeking assistance, straightforwardly discussed the successes and failures of ancient texts, encouraging Sicong to study in this manner. Initially, there was no time, like on other days when writers skillfully wield their pens and tongues to create texts.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>I have observed that in recent times, no place has praised physicians more than Wu region. Among the physicians of Wu, none is more renowned than the Ge family. The medical practice of the Ge family excels in discerning the rise and fall of the five movements and six qi, using this to analyze illness and determine treatment methods. This is the art of Zhongzheng, which sets him apart from others. </p>
<p>Indeed, one of Zhongzheng&#39;s uncles, known as Hengzhai, once authored a book, stating that medicine should consider the fluctuations of time to determine what is to be added or diminished. Liu Shouzheng, Zhang Zihe, and others practiced their art during a time of strength for the Jurchens, when the people were robust and fierce, and thus often employed methods of release. However, as times became weak, with the aftermath of war and famine causing hardship, Zhang Jiegu, Li Ming and their peers tended to focus more on restoration and nourishment. </p>
<p>By the time of the Song dynasty, physicians generally aimed to preserve vital qi but did not comprehend the necessary offense. They could nurture diseases but not cure them, failing to understand the transformations involved. Such discussions illustrate an understanding of the changes in qi movements and the implications of yin and yang transformations.</p>
<p>As for modern physicians, they are filled with benevolence and righteousness. They have extensively studied various texts and are proficient in the Taoist arts. They are well-versed in the principles of yin and yang, and have a clear understanding of qi dynamics. They differentiate medicines by their warming or cooling effects and assess the pulse for superficial or interior conditions. Their treatment employs supplements or purges based on a careful examination of the illness&#39;s nature—whether it is deficiency or excess. They tailor their prescriptions according to the illness and administer remedies accordingly. Their clever techniques are instinctive, adapting fluidly without rigidity. They do not seek to enhance their reputations but aim merely to benefit others. They do not calculate personal gain or profit, and regardless of wealth or poverty, they apply the same remedies. Their ability to bring the dead back to life is as profound as the heavens and earth. Such enlightened physicians will have their names celebrated for generations to come.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Admonitions for Inferior Physicians</strong></p>
<p>Today&#39;s inferior physicians flaunt their oddities, lacking knowledge of classical texts and understanding of characters. They self-promote to deceive the world, rushing to people&#39;s doors without invitation. They present banal remedies and ask for ailments superficially. They boast of their abilities, indulging in flattery. Patients do not examine their issues, treating their ailments vaguely. They do not investigate the origins of their illnesses or distinguish between true and false conditions. They disregard life and death, acting recklessly in the moment. Suddenly, illnesses worsen and they hastily disperse. They endanger lives for minimal profit. Such inferior physicians are shameful and to be feared.</p>
<p><strong>Admonitions for Patients</strong></p>
<p>Today&#39;s patients are often stingy with their expenditures. They refuse urgent treatment, waiting for self-recovery. They do not seek the wise but hope for the easy solution. They overlook their conditions, carelessly trying various remedies. Some even invoke spirits, which leads to nothing worthwhile. Stepping on frost without caution invites the hard ice. By the time they seek skilled physicians, their illnesses have become severe. Even if there are miraculous elixirs, they are hard to cure. Their ignorance and delay result from their own actions. They only resign to fate, thinking luck will improve. Such confusion is truly lamentable. These patients must rectify this folly.</p>
<p><strong>Warnings for Physicians</strong></p>
<p>The weight of human life is immense, and the role of a physician is the most challenging. The source of illness must be thoroughly investigated, and medicines must be prescribed with care. One should achieve complete treatment and not linger over years. Life and death are crucial matters known only to heaven. Compassionate colleagues should think deeply about their duty to help the world.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>The Original Path of Medicine</p>
<p>Great is medicine! Its origins are far-reaching! Since the chaos was separated and the wilderness began to take shape, the light and clear aspects of yang rose to form heaven, while the heavy and turbid aspects of yin descended to form earth. Heaven flourished and took its place above, while earth sank and took its place below. Thus, the essence of yang became the sun, rising in the east and setting in the west; the essence of yin became the moon, visible at night and hidden during the day. The dual principles stood firm, and the two luminaries moved in their courses. At this point, the primal energy condensed in the void, and water began to emerge; the red energy radiated through the void, and fire began to emerge; the azure energy floated in the void, and wood began to emerge; the white energy traversed the void, and metal began to emerge; the black energy met in the void, and earth began to emerge. With the five elements complete, myriad things were born, establishing the way of the three origins. Therefore, in human life, one must obtain the righteous energy of heaven and earth. The head is round, resembling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. Heaven has yin and yang, and humans have qi and blood. Heaven has five elements, and humans have five organs. The people of the divine Tian clan lived in nests in caves, subsisting on raw flesh and drinking blood. They moved to avoid the cold and took refuge in shadows to escape the heat. When the great simplicity had not yet opened, what ailments could there be? Later, Fuxi observed the heavens and the energy, and created hexagrams. In later generations, there emerged the &quot;Heavenly Origin Jade Book,&quot; regarded as Fuxi&#39;s text, which was recited and passed down orally for ten generations. Shennong tasted all the herbs, experiencing seventy poisons in a single day; thereafter, the study of herbal medicine flourished.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor donned his robes and ruled the world, engaging in dialogue with Qi Bo, the Heavenly Master, to discuss profound questions. They explored celestial phenomena above and the geography below, aiming to alleviate the suffering of the people. Thus, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; was created. Once this text was established, when people fell ill, they would necessarily rely on acupuncture to treat external ailments and decoctions for internal healing. Subsequently, as simplicity vanished and desires grew rampant among the populace, disasters multiplied, and only with potent, minor, chronic, and non-toxic medicines could relief be achieved. The essence of medicine lies within the book &quot;Suwen.&quot; It comprises twenty-four volumes and eighty-one chapters, detailing the principles of vital energy, clarifying the fundamentals of meridians, discussing diseases to address their root causes, and prescribing appropriate treatments—all systematically arranged and presented with clarity and coherence. </p>
<p>Works such as the &quot;Great Treatise on the Celestial Origin,&quot; &quot;Great Treatise on the Six Origins,&quot; &quot;Great Treatise on the Five Constants,&quot; and the &quot;Great Treatise on the Changes of Qi,&quot; along with several chapters on intricate and subtle principles, truly represent a great legacy for ages, a complete path for liberation from bondage, guiding vital energy to save the common people, and aiding the weak to find peace. Below Xu and Qi, generations have found notable figures. Bian Que grasped a few principles and expounded on them in the &quot;Nanjing&quot;; Huangfu Shiyu followed and composed &quot;Jia Yi&quot;; Yang Shangshan compiled the &quot;Tai Su.&quot; Just as the interpretations of Jin and Yuan revealed insights, and Master Qi&#39;s annotations clarified understanding, it is said that a pure source will yield a clear flow, and a well-structured display will cast a correct shadow—such has been the wisdom of renowned physicians through the ages.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Only Zhang Zhongjing, the magistrate of Changsha during the Han dynasty, uniquely sought the root of medical knowledge, exploring subtle meanings, and establishing principles for regulation of rulers, ministers, and assistants. He created medical formulas, articulating the interplay of emptiness and fullness—a true secret not passed down for a millennium—demonstrating the qualities of a great sage and a second saint, with contributions that bridge past and future. Scholars since the Han and Tang dynasties have sought to delve into these profound insights. Moreover, the principles of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; are deep and obscure, with no clear path for entry. Works like Chao Yuanfang’s &quot;The Sources of Illness&quot; and Sun Simiao’s &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; contain elaborate language, yet their principles become increasingly unclear; their prescriptions grow wider, straying from authenticity. Few have sincerely applied the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon Zhu Fengyi&#39;s discussion as the magistrate of Changsha, compiling the &quot;Living Human Book&quot; of Nanyang, Zhang Zhongjing taught that yin and yang should be interpreted as inner and outer, while Fengyi explained yin and yang in terms of cold and heat. A slight deviation can lead to significant errors; while they may have saved many lives, equally, many have died. Fortunately, Liu Zhi’s &quot;Essential Discussions&quot; and &quot;Original Patterns of Illness&quot; have been created, making the principles of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; as clear as the sun and moon. With the creation of &quot;Direct Rectification&quot; and &quot;Illuminating Discussions,&quot; the laws of Changsha have been condensed to essential principles. Transforming the Gui Zhi Ma Huang Decoction into the Double Resolving Powder and altering the Ten Jujube Decoction into the Three Flower Divine Support Pill demonstrates significant contributions to the sage’s teachings.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>At the same time, there were Zhang and others who expounded on the Great Way of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; continuing the rightful source of Hejian and discussing learning with Ma Zhigui, also writing the book &quot;Confucianism and Filial Piety.&quot; They claimed: &quot;In vomiting, there is sweating; in diarrhea, there is replenishment. The sage has only three methods, with no fourth method.&quot; This is an unchangeable, definitive discourse and a profound maxim. Thus, there was the sorrow of Liu and Zhang.</p>
<p>As for Dongyuan Lao-ren, he elucidated the principles of the &quot;Suwen,&quot; adhering to the methods of Zhang Zhongjing, and authored &quot;Ten Books on Rescuing Life and Extracting Essence&quot; for the world, clarifying the pulse and the weights and measures of medications, as well as the rising, descending, floating, and sinking of drugs; hence, there are analogies of righteous and hegemonic methods.</p>
<p>Regarding the Danxi Zhu family, they meticulously researched febrile diseases and internal injuries, with a particular focus on the profound implications of phlegm and fire, achieving remarkable insights. Song Taishi Lian remarked that their collection represents the pinnacle of medical achievement, which is indeed true.</p>
<p>As for my dynasty, it revised the &quot;Da Guan Materia Medica,&quot; created the &quot;Bronze Man Acupuncture Classics,&quot; and the &quot;Imperially Granted Medical Formulas,&quot; establishing the Taiyi Department to assist the sacred self, and appointing excellent physicians to assist the royal court, with the benevolent pharmacy to alleviate the sufferings of the people, demonstrating a heart of compassion akin to that of Xuanqi, surpassing the Han and Tang dynasties. Thus, esteemed physicians continued to emerge.</p>
<p>For instance, Tao Jie&#39;an&#39;s insights on febrile diseases disclosed matters not mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing; Xue Ji excelled in surgery, supplementing the gaps left by Dongyuan; Ge Kejiu&#39;s treatment of internal injuries, and Qian Ying&#39;s pediatric studies, were also not inferior to the Danxi legacy. The accomplishments of scholars in this age are indeed remarkable!</p>
<p>If future students are aware of the essentials and follow them accordingly, the path will be accurate, and the medical doctrine will also be approachable. Therefore, it is said: &quot;To know the essentials is to conclude with a single word.&quot;<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br><strong>Complete Works of Ancient and Modern Literature, Medical Section, Volume 519</strong></p>

<p><strong>Whirlwind Chant</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Shao Yong)</strong>  </p>
<p>Recently, my frail body is afflicted with illness, how can medicine not be sought?<br>The dense leaves in front of the pavilion form a canopy, while the yellow flowers below scatter gold in vain.<br>Leisurely observing bees gathering nectar, silently watching swallows build their nests.<br>It’s not that there are few kindred spirits in the world, rather, it’s that the Yao people are not good at playing the lute.<br>The Yao people are not good at playing the lute, it’s not that there are few kindred spirits in the world.<br>In old age, one finds it hard to do what the youth can, and in youth, one knows not the heart of the old.<br>Nurturing the spirit, I simply sit in stillness, adjusting my thoughts with joy in clear verses.<br>Why is it that medicine is not sought? Recently, my frail body is afflicted with illness.</p>
<p><strong>Arm Pain Chant</strong><br><strong>(Previous Author)</strong>  </p>
<p>First, the pain from wind has afflicted my body, now an added pain in the arm, what to do?<br>No harm in lifting my cup, just no bowing; though I may neglect combing, I have not neglected my books.<br>I do not seek results from doctors, merely chatting and laughing to avoid troubles.<br>Generally, as things age, they must fall ill; how can a person grow old without illness?</p>
<p><strong>Illness Chant</strong><br><strong>(Previous Author)</strong>  </p>
<p>If one has an illness, they should seek medicine; if the medicine is not good, the body will surely suffer.<br>If a nation is ill, it must seek a healer; if the people are not good, the nation will surely be in peril.<br>When matters are not urgent, one should swiftly change; when matters are urgent, even regret is hard to undo.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Again [From Predecessors]</strong></p>
<p>A person is like a nation; when ill, one should seek a doctor. When the illness is cured, the medication should cease, as moderation is the proper approach.</p>
<p><strong>Wounds of Du Ying [Song Wang Anshi]</strong></p>
<p>In shabby wild clothes, I can forget my old poverty. I avoid the noise and live near the marketplace, rising dust upon my figure. Engaging with others through humility. Equalizing all things, I toil without shame for my body. My heart grieves in the ground of the past; I shall no longer see this person.</p>
<p><strong>The Second [From Predecessors]</strong></p>
<p>Uncle Du, son of a physician; Jun Ping, the fortune-teller in the market. The desolation of yesterday&#39;s affairs seems to echo the manners of ancient people. In the old residence, rain breeds mushrooms; the new house shifts cold and desolate. Who inquires about life and death? Alas, I am also empty and barren.</p>
<p><strong>To the Physician Deng Xiankuang [Song Yang Shi]</strong></p>
<p>Heaven and earth share one breath, like a melting pot. Clay and soil gather in accordance with round and square. The divine and physical exist in nine chambers, flowing through the nine realms, while the eight winds carry things like sharp weapons. The heavenly record holds ancient meanings; research began long before the Three Sovereigns. Mr. Sang, an extraordinary figure from Yue, who can pass on the art of acupuncture with stone needles? Cheap labor adds more harm than good, often leading to premature death and shortened years. I admire your youthful brilliance in pursuing studies; profound truths are often deeply explored. Hearing of yin brings yang through divine encounters; reflecting on acupuncture techniques feels like setting traps. At the road&#39;s corner, the herbs turn into bait, while a long snake hangs already upon the cart. Alas, I am weak, suffering from many ailments; the room of Vimalakirti feels quite desolate. I wish for you to quickly alleviate the illnesses of the world, to wash away my lingering sickness and restore me to health.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>To Zhu Songpo</strong><br>By Wen Tianxiang of the Song Dynasty</p>
<p>Though I have yet to attain the level of the great physician Wang, I laugh at the yearly injuries from broken arms. The mountains and rivers within the screen appear vivid, while the pines and chrysanthemums in the pavilion have already taken their stance. Delving deeply into silent contemplation of meditation, I quietly face the stringless qin. Thank you for the poem you sent me from the mountain peak; the full garden of plum blossoms plays with the spring light.</p>
<p><strong>To the Shu Physician Zhong Zhengfu</strong><br>By an earlier poet</p>
<p>The Fiery Sovereign gazes upon the myriad of grasses, diverse types abound in the western regions. Wishing for you to gaze upon the towering Min, my tears flow abundantly. In days of yore, people from Qin and Yue traveled from dawn in Luoyang to dusk in Handan. You bring the magpie scripture from the west and also head south. In Jiangnan, there are wandering wings; how could I not long for the old camp? When will we share the imperial winds and the six energies be harmonious and tranquil?</p>
<p><strong>To Peng Tongbo Wei Hetang</strong><br>By an earlier poet</p>
<p>To manage oneself is akin to governing a nation; using medicine is like waging war. A person can preserve the harmony of heaven, ensuring peace within themselves. External evils infiltrate, worse than bandits and plunderers. If one is not careful in their defenses, the enemy will take advantage and become stronger. In ancient times, there were the writings of the Yellow Emperor, much like today’s Six Secret Teachings. The fierce man commands with a strong voice, while the benevolent general relies on support from rare herbs. Feathered robes belong to his followers, who discern the struggle of yin and yang. I point out the differences between life and death, resounding and shaking with power. Daoists govern lead and mercury; the skin and pores are like heavy bolts. In the end, the key is crucial, and the six energies do not dare to intrude. You are currently raising flags and drums, not daring to leave and yet in awe. At other times, I will hang my bow, closing the door to read the Huang Ting.</p>
<p><strong>To Ling Ning Sheng</strong><br>By Song Xi of the Ming Dynasty<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>Guest of the river and sea, Lord Hua frequently visits Hejia Creek. Gathering herbs, he travels among the clouds, composing poetry as he passes by the waters to the west.<br>　　　　To Physician Yang</p>
<p>The spring breeze brings warmth to Tongcheng, gently lifting my ailing body. You laugh at my lifelong ambitions, as you make it seem I am unknown. At the hottest point of summer, the bass is a delicacy; as autumn approaches, the wild geese bring their calls. I carefully measure the use of aconite and rhubarb; only in danger do I begin to trust in the miraculous power of medicine.<br>　　　　To Yin Ju</p>
<p>The physician from Luojiang, with flowing beard, is called by all “the immortal Yin.” Though I am poor and hesitant to sell medicines, the incense of my benevolent deeds hangs in every house.<br>　　　　Inscription at the residence of Doctor Xuan Shou, Mother of Xing</p>
<p>After drawing water from the orange well, green shows itself; the apricot grove blooms red in time. What worries could this Xuan have? Every year, he welcomes the spring breeze. Coral branches and jade leaves emerge; sea folk add their nets from seaside dwellings. At eighty, I suppose he already knows that having children is indeed like holding precious treasures.<br>　　　　Bidding farewell to physician friends Wang Changnian on the way to Qingzhou</p>
<p>In this desolate city, I can hardly bear to part; I sip thick wine for comfort. Truly, you are needed for my sickly bones, as my face turns towards another. Though I lack the boat of Guo, I still have the wheel of Lü. I send a message to Yunmen, urging them to revive their vitality.<br>　　　　Reflective writing presented to Physicians Xing and Shao</p>
<p>In the spring morning, after the meal is set, I proceed to examine the prescriptions. The small officials all possess their troubles, while the old man is helpless in his struggles. After the pillow moves, the birds cry; when the cup is filled, the flowers begin to fall. Moreover, I am too lazy to discuss poetry; it is unnecessary for guests to rise for me.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Part Two: The Ancients</strong></p>
<p>The wheat rain is cold, while the warmth is coming; the garden flowers fade with the morning. The fishermen and woodcutters first enter my ear, while the birds and sparrows already peek at the door. Without regard for the bonds of office, only speak of the importance of medicine. In recent years, the millet fields have suffered, I shall empty my fragrant cup for you.</p>
<p><strong>Poem on Crossing the River</strong> (Inscribed to Dr. Xing) </p>
<p>When the Buddha expounds the Dharma, the Medicine King serves as the mentor. The Primordial Supreme plays with lotus leaves, rescuing those who are in peril. Confucian teachings have long been lonely, though their merit may illuminate the healing arts. Master Xing is adept and talented, establishing his presence at Huangqi. In the morning, he drinks from the Orange Well; in the evening, he drinks from the Long Mulberry Pond. In Jiangyin, there are over a hundred thousand households, each embraced by the spring wind. The lingering waves benefit Wu, and invoke compassion in my northern hall. To handle the paddle is my challenge, yet the clear stream is a delight to hunger. O those who ask about crossing, I am ashamed of your words about crossing the river.</p>
<p><strong>To the Renowned Medical Practitioner Xuanyang</strong> (By Zhang Yu)</p>
<p>Beneath the long bridge, the dragon palace is pressed down; the people on the shore are mirrored in the water. The Taoist sells medicine by the stream, curing the green snake that is the dragon&#39;s son. To repay kindness without accepting pearls of a thousand gold, the dragon lord passes down books from the sea. In front of my door, the support of canes looks like a market; with such marvelous skills, what worries could a three-broken arm bring? Before the white grasses of Yanzhi Mountain in autumn, the chill enters, and tears of golden sores begin to flow. How can I get a golden elixir from you, to carry the jade dragon back to face the enemy?</p>

<p><strong>Praise for the Biography of Bian Que and Cang Gong</strong> [Han, Sima Qian]</p>
<p>The Grand Historian said: Women have no true beauty or ugliness, yet in the palace, they are prone to jealousy; scholars possess neither virtue nor vice, but when entering the court, they are seen with suspicion. Hence, Bian Que faced calamity due to his skills, and Cang Gong then hid away and accepted punishment, while Ti Ying communicated through letters, allowing their father to regain peace. Thus, Laozi said: “Beautiful things are vessels of misfortune,” can we say that Bian Que is among them? Those like Cang Gong could be considered to be closer to this idea.</p>
<p><strong>Preface to the Artistic Literature Section of the Book of Han</strong> [Han, Ban Gu]</p>
<p>The medical canon originates from the understanding of human blood, vessels, marrow, yin and yang, to identify the root of illnesses and the distinction between life and death. It involves the proper application of acupuncture, stones, herbs, and heat, harmonizing various medications according to their appropriateness. The acquisition of benefits is like that of using a kind stone to extract iron, utilizing materials accordingly. Those who are unskilled may misunderstand the principles, mistaking recovery for severity, and life for death. The classical formulas are based on the temperature of herbs and stones, assessing the depth of illnesses, using the taste of medicine, tailored to the response of the body, distinguishing between the five bitter and six pungent flavors, balancing water and fire to unblock and resolve issues, restoring harmony. If one loses their appropriateness, they might exacerbate heat with heat or cold with cold, injuring their essence internally, which is a unique loss. Hence, it is said: “There are illnesses that go untreated but often result in the use of traditional Chinese medicine.”<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those skilled in the art of healing are essential tools for life, serving as a safeguard of royal authority. In ancient times, there were Qi Bo and Yu Fu; in the middle ages, there were Bian Que and Qin He. They addressed illness and governance, using diagnosis to understand administration. During the rise of the Han dynasty, there was Cang Gong, yet today, his techniques are obscure. Therefore, I discuss his texts to introduce the art of healing.</p>
<p>Encouragement for Physicians: In the realm between heaven and earth, humanity is the most intelligent. What people value most is life. Although lifespans vary, whether short or long, the whims of temperature and appetite lead to different ailments, causing untimely death; thus, neglecting one’s nature can destroy health. The key to rescuing from these afflictions truly lies in effective prescriptions. Therefore, it is crucial for the esteemed physician to be well-versed in the classics, as the great masters are honored as the kings of medicine. Just as the enlightened one can alleviate suffering, they can only treat the disruptions of the four elements. There are also poets who praise the beauty of Pengcheng, the gentleness of the Qin state, the encounter of Ji Liang with the Lu family, and the meeting of Guo Zi with the people of Yue. </p>
<p>Finally, with the long-lasting pursuit of immortality and the wondrous path, one can still transform the six into one using golden elixirs and refine the three into seven using silver pills. They gather secrets in jade boxes and explore the profound wisdom of ancient texts. What is peach gum? The Northern Dipper cannot hide its form.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The golden paste is not far; the bright pearl is still ashamed of its price. It can make the sounds of the drums resonate beneath the door of the family business, and even beside the solemn offerings, the sound of the flute lingers. In the Zhou Li, the physician is in charge of the ailments of the people; for every citizen who is ill, they are treated in accordance with their afflictions. At the end of the year, each physician records their treatments and submits them, to know what has healed and what has not, as a caution for future practice. </p>
<p>As for studying the essence of the original principles, and examining the Confucian traditions, one may spend all day in clear discussions and all night in rigorous study. At the beginning of learning, one may still cling to flattery; as one accumulates achievements, only then does one earn the title of teacher. With the passing of days and months, one can be called a scholar of great learning; even after mastering the classics, one still needs deep discussions. The net of knowledge must be wide, and the hooks of understanding must be deep; if one is satisfied and not awake, then the days are simply not enough.</p>
<p>Moreover, when composing poetry, one must often discern the essence, whether ancient or modern, refined or popular, everything must be observed closely, with a detailed understanding of what to take and what to leave behind; then the beautiful phrases may emerge, and the exquisite cadence will come to life.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Can one master poetry without guidance from texts, or understand the Book of Changes without discussing it? Yangzi Yun said: &quot;Read a thousand poems, and then you can write poetry.&quot; How much more so for the path of medicine, where the nine divisions of diagnosis are quite intricate, and understanding the properties of a hundred medicines is difficult. Observing colors and discerning sounds, their effectiveness is deeply secret; in autumn, ailments can be subtle, and in summer, sufferings are hard to identify. When compared to the practitioners, there has never been thorough agreement or discussion; often, in youth, scholars skim the surface, knowing vaguely that licorice is sweet and cassia is spicy, thinking this is enough for their practice. Yet, the established methods are disregarded; they read Zhuangzi in the same year, while others favor the Book of Changes. However, when patients seek my help, I still cannot fully achieve the desired treatment, even if I cannot reach the source, it can still benefit myself. Therefore, if there are no barriers of social status, and one diligently enhances their knowledge with past experience, they can indeed unravel the complexities. Daily learning what is lacking, one can compose brilliant techniques, yet I would still say it cannot be done.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are many who treat illnesses, but they often respond carelessly and indiscriminately. Those who truly care for others are rare. Thus, one may spend days traversing various methods and months honing countless techniques, yet they have never truly respected the efficacy of their medicines, leaving matters of life and death to chance. Their superficial accomplishments are of no real value. When love runs deep among kin, and feelings are intense, but ailments arise in critical areas, and diseases manifest severely, even if one wishes to exert their full efforts to heal, they find that there are no results. Why is this? It is because they lack foundation in these matters and are thus difficult to change. </p>
<p>Certain herbs like hu ma (flaxseed) can only alleviate headaches, while others like mai qu (barley) and qiong huan (spicebush) may counteract specific ailments. If one fails to recognize their place and is constrained by their circumstances, how can they hope to resuscitate the dead in the capital and gain fame among the elite? Such aspirations are unattainable. The path of healing is genuinely challenging—this is a stark reality. </p>
<p>It is indeed necessary to contemplate these thoughts and elevate what is good. This is not only about leaving a name for future generations; it is also an act of profound merit. Comparing it to freeing a single pigeon on a scale or reviving ten thousand fish in a pond is not something that can be discussed in the same breath.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Medicine</strong> by Li Hua (Tang Dynasty)</p>
<p>The Duke of Jin was planning to invade Qin, but soon fell ill. The Duke of Qin sent a physician, He, to examine him. Before he set off, he cautioned, &quot;With neighboring countries in conflict, how can a physician proceed with his task?&quot; He replied, &quot;I do not dispense medicine or herbs; I will use words to cure the Duke of Jin so that the nation suffers no harm.&quot; The Duke of Qin was pleased and honored him with a grand send-off.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Jin, the physician found the Duke in a luxurious setting, surrounded by more than a hundred attendants adorned in jewels, while chefs prepared feasts in the courtyard before inviting guests. The physician declined, saying, &quot;I was commissioned by my lord to remedy your illness. Now, the great country has turned to appearances and meals to treat me; this is beyond my capacity.&quot; The military officials replied, &quot;This is how our lord honors you, not an oversight, please respect our customs.&quot; The physician said, &quot;I have journeyed a thousand miles at great physical strain and lack energy. All I desire is one cup of wine, a dish of fruit, and some light side dishes to accompany my meal; I don&#39;t wish to burden your great country with more.&quot; </p>
<p>Having respectfully accepted their offerings, he examined the Duke and said, &quot;Your voice is hoarse and waning, your energy is turbulent and superficial, your complexion is cold yet your build is robust. You are akin to the King of Chu; this can either be remedied or not.&quot;<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Duke of Jin said: &quot;What is the situation of the Duke of Chu in relation to me?&quot; The guest replied: &quot;I once visited Chu. Its territory is vast and rich, with mountains, rivers, forests, and marshes stretching beyond the Huai River all the way to the South Sea. Jin cannot compete with Qi and Qin.&quot; The Duke of Jin said: &quot;I have never ventured into Chu and am unfamiliar with its king. I wish to hear about that country.&quot; The guest said: &quot;Your Grace, I do not recall delving into the details of Chu&#39;s boundaries either; I can only speak of what I have seen. Chu is near the outskirts, about three hundred miles from Ying. If you drive a cart up the hill, you can see the various palaces; the red and white hues illuminate the heavens, yet you cannot see the sky above. Like floating water, half is within; the waves of the vast water sway, rising and falling with the wind. The majestic southern peaks, pine trees are everlasting; sometimes lurking, sometimes rising, creating a varied landscape of heights and depths. Flowing clouds shift in weight, at times vanishing, at times brightening; the roads stretch and wind, surrounding mountains and rivers. The cart covers seems like a pavilion as you ascend the high ground; the red sky looms overhead, and you raise your hand to touch the heavens. What appeared high is now beneath the cart; the dark valley is shrouded, stones thrown make no sound. Describing its inner pastures, the mountains darkly frame the doors, with a hazy and jagged view, as if strong blades and curtains were to come apart and come together again. Dew seals the gaps in the rock, sounds small as they come, yet resonate loudly in response. The cliffs are steep and bathed in sunlight, piercing through the horizon as clouds hover.&quot;<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

Through cliffs, rushing torrents rush forth and leap away; initially thought reachable, suddenly seeming boundless. Whirling and sliding, swirling in eddies; stones rolling against fortifications, fire igniting on the riverbanks. Confirmed as tamed and yet turbulent, sand spilling into waves; white smoke faintly blue, waters stretching into view. Faintly vibrant, lasting long enough to form boundaries; soft rain falls, clouds rise in the dark. Spring is born in the Yuan and Xiang rivers, evening arrives in Cangwu; sound and silence end, color follows the distant gaze. Water plants and lotus flowers create a delicate embroidery across the river. Astonished by the multitude of bird names, they disperse and unite upon the water; drifting downstream, sometimes resisting the waves to return. Roaring and terrifying like thunder, clouds rise and churn; neither harms the other, appearances are serene in leisurely grace. By the riverbank, they repeatedly observe, reflecting the river into a rosy haze; clear water ripples, with depths revealing sand; beside the corridors, overflow drenches the railings.

The young nobles of the city petitioned to open the gates for battle, while the elder ones advised that the ruler must prioritize the well-being of the people. Chu relies on its wealth and strength, and indulges in desires that are not sufficiently frightening. The ruler then mobilized resources to provide aid to the borders, while the smaller rulers sought to ensure supplies for the four seasons. The ruler remarked: &#39;This aid is given by people and returned to people; without people, there would be none of this. What is there to cherish?&#39; He then ordered the senior nobles to distribute money to the people and express gratitude, saying: &#39;I am unworthy, causing your fathers and brothers not to protect themselves against the army of Chu, which is why I have exhausted all efforts for you.&#39; The people of Qin, moved by the ruler&#39;s words, wept, and even women and daughters requested to take revenge on Chu. Upon hearing this, the court of Chu withdrew its army by evening. Both ruler and ministers were deeply shocked and accepted their roles under Qin; this was the method of the former kings who did not engage in warfare. The Duke of Jin was perplexed by the events in Chu and, consequently, ceased plotting against Qin.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Zhou Guan&quot; states that physicians are responsible for treating the illnesses of the people. Generally, any affliction one suffers can be cured, but if left untreated for too long, it may lead to death. One has yet to observe an illness that cannot be cured. In the regions of Ba and Chu, there is a custom of consulting spirits, which has existed since ancient times. When the five elements are in disarray, causing the suffering of severe plagues, it is often said that these are illnesses brought by the seasons and not something medicine can address. Therefore, they pray to the spirits without rest, offering chicken, pig, duck, and sheep in hopes of receiving bountiful blessings. If they cannot recover, they blame themselves for the spirits not coming to aid; if they are fortunate enough to heal, they attribute it to their diligent prayers and numerous offerings. Otherwise, how could they contend with the elements? </p>
<p>Moreover, if treatment is delayed, the poison of the illness gradually affects the entire household. Thus, even close friends and relatives dare not approach each other&#39;s homes, fearing the spread of infection; children fear their parents, and wives avoid their husbands. Wealthy individuals may still manage to have a shaman protect them, while the poor are left to suffer alone in silence. In such circumstances, not only is the charity of medicine cut off, but even food supplies are also scarce. As a result, those who die are often around eighteen or nineteen, yet the people remain oblivious to the causes.</p>
<p>I once inquired about this with others, and it turned out the real issue was the dominance of shamans over physicians. Alas! Can shamans truly surpass all physicians? What they conquer are merely the easily misled common folk. For illnesses are rooted within the body, while spirits lurk outside. Good medicine is meant to treat internal afflictions.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Now, if one does not address the ailments within but solely seeks fortune from without, when the situation becomes dire, it is inappropriate to neglect the need for care and inquiry; would this not be a mistake? If crops in flourishing fields are damaged by pests, one must completely eliminate the pests for the crops to thrive. If a household has valuable possessions but thieves invade, the owner must wield weapons to either kill or capture the intruders to protect their wealth. The same is true for the human body: when confronted with the influences of yin and yang and facing illness, one should have a physician examine the sounds, look at the color, check the pulse, and prescribe medicine to address the internal organs, allowing the body to return to equilibrium. If one avoids seeking medical treatment and expects to reap the rewards without eliminating the pests, or seeks to preserve their wealth without driving away thieves, it is utterly unattainable. How much more so for the state, which values medical texts as the utmost priority.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

Later, during the Qingli period, the virtuous Minister Fan Wenzheng suggested that physicians from the capital and other regions gather for lectures and training to improve their skills, thereby eliminating errors and saving lives, which would truly assist in effective governance. However, the common people were unaware of the court&#39;s benevolent intentions and instead fell prey to false beliefs, endangering their lives, which was genuinely lamentable.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Inscription</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty - Lü Huai)</strong></p>
<p>In the Jin dynasty, there was a man named Wu Tai who was skilled in medicine. A local official presented a memorial, and he was appointed as the chief physician, after which he returned to his hometown to establish a temple in honor of the Holy Marquis. Having mastered his art, he returned to express gratitude to his teacher and sought to broaden his knowledge, displaying a commendable ambition.</p>
<p>At that time, I had been exiled and was serving as an official in Puzhong. After fulfilling my duties, I sought to document my thoughts in the temple, and thus I created this medical inscription to commend his dedication and fulfill his aspirations. I knew that what I shared could nourish his goodness.</p>
<p>The inscription states:<br>The six qi and five elements are the essence of life; the three regions and nine pulses converge in harmony. In ancient times, there were unique techniques that cleansed the intestines and washed the stomach, using acupuncture to relieve ailments. Observing the roots of the pulse allows one to anticipate and conquer without direct confrontation, to preserve life.</p>
<p>Healing the illnesses of the world is akin to holding the reins of a nation, always ensuring that harmful elements do not interfere with righteousness. One must dedicate oneself fully; the heart&#39;s deep troubles will surely arise, and if one benefits from the art, even the smallest detail can lead to profound results. Wu Tai was proactive, never forgetting his teacher, weighing the importance of righteousness against personal gain, and being cautious in his practice.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

<p>When I first lived in my hometown, there was a person who had a cold and a cough. They consulted the physicians, who believed it to be a case of &quot;poison&quot; and treated him with lethal methods, taking a hundred gold coins for the treatment. They administered poison medicine that attacked his stomach and intestines, burned his skin, and prohibited him from enjoying delicious food. After a month, a hundred ailments arose, with internal heat vexing coldness, and the cough persisted without end—the symptoms were truly those of poison. </p>
<p>I sought out another physician, who thought it was heat and prescribed cold medicine. He vomited in the morning and had diarrhea by night, thus he could no longer eat. In fear, he regressed; his symptoms, including severe headaches and various other ailments, worsened, and after trying three doctors, the condition became even more dire. </p>
<p>An old man in the village told him: This is the fault of the physician, the excess of medicine! What sickness have you? In life, one relies primarily on qi (vital energy) and secondarily on food. Now, you are consuming medicine all day long, with foul smells overwhelming, while a hundred poisons battle within you. You exhaust your primary source and neglect your supplementary source, and that is why you are ill. Retreat and rest, thank the physician, reject the medicine, and indulge in what you enjoy; when your vitality is restored and your food satisfying, then good medicine can yield effective results in just one drink.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Discussion with Yang Yuanfu on the Diagnosis of Liang Kuangfu&#39;s Illness</p>
<p>Liang Kuangfu: The right flank relates to the lungs; coughing and spitting blood, accompanied by shortness of breath, indicates lung conditions; if there is a fever, rapid pulse, and inability to eat, it signifies that fire is attacking metal, resulting in deficiency of both the lung and spleen. When both the lung and spleen are deficient and fire invades, the illness manifests in reverse, thus it is improper to use tonifying or purging methods. Fortifying metal would mean that metal and fire clash, worsening cough and shortness of breath; purging fire would result in fire not retreating, and nodules would exacerbate. The correct approach is to initially support the vital energy with the Ren Shen Bai Du San and then add a small amount of active illness remedy. I have heard that this remedy has been used without effect, suggesting that the condition is severely reversed and the medication has not reached its target. One should discuss thoroughly with Kuangfu; as autumn cools, recovery may be possible. The pulse condition tends to resist the fiery energy of spring and summer, while it recedes in autumn and winter. It is advisable to only use the tonifying soup while adjusting according to the seasonal variations of yin and yang, the rising and falling, the floating and sinking, the warming and cooling, and the evidence seen for increasing or decreasing dosages. Follow the natural flow for rising and falling, and counteract for warming and cooling. To treat effectively, harmonize what is harmonious. If there is a sensation of energy stagnation, intermittently take a modified Zhi Zhu pill; if there is a problem with diet, intermittently take a specific Zhi Zhu soup. After several months, the reversed energy may begin to subside, making treatment methods applicable.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>However, I fear that today, if the complexion turns blue or red, and the pulse is thin or full, it will be hopeless. In recent discussions on medicine, there are those who follow Liu of Hejian and those who follow Zhang of Yizhou. Zhang’s approach to medication adjusts according to the four seasons and the yin-yang balance, aligning with the principles of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; regarding the regulation of spirit and the four energies. A physician who does not understand this acts recklessly. Liu’s method focuses on innovation and the removal of any stagnation, adhering to the principle of preserving the natural order without harm. A physician ignorant of this lacks the art. However, those who adhere to Zhang may not fully grasp his profundity, leading them to avoid decisive treatments, resulting in many missing opportunities for recovery. Those who follow Liu may not fully comprehend his essence, risking hasty actions that harm the vital energy and create problems for the future. If one can utilize the strengths of both schools without the drawbacks, then healing is likely attainable! Concerning the condition of Kuanfu, the initial symptoms must be profound, as the inflicted area cannot fully discharge at the moment, leading to stagnation and the emergence of new conditions, persisting until now. One might also consider following Liu’s principle of innovation, adding some discharging herbs to the medicinal formula for invigorating Qi, which may provide a gradual relief. This is my humble opinion, and I do not presume it to be certain; I merely wish for the talented Yuanfu to discuss and deliberate together.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Reading Pharmacy Books: A Ruminative Record by Liu Yin</strong></p>
<p>Human beings possess this essence, and with it, their bodies, consisting of the five organs and bones, resonate and allow the vital energy to flow. The sounds, colors, and tastes that connect to human senses such as mouth, nose, ears, and eyes may seem superficial, yet they fundamentally interact with similar essences within us and become harmonized; whereas, those that are dissimilar invariably clash. Even within a single person, one cannot fully grasp this. For instance, when taking medicine, if one uses the powdered remains of decayed wood and bones mixed as a potion, each will indeed align with their corresponding essences. Therefore, the underlying principle is the same. Thus, the ancients said: the flavor of wood is sour; its roots beneath the earth resemble bones, hence bones are nourished by sourness. The flavor of metal is pungent; metals intertwine with various substances resembling tendons, thus tendons are nourished by pungency. Salty represents water and resembles veins; bitter represents fire and resembles Qi; sweet represents earth and resembles flesh. Their forms are inherently aligned with their categories, so how could their essences not flow together? Expanding on this, the principles of fortune and misfortune relate likewise to good and evil.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At the onset of the illness, a great heat arose within my four limbs, followed by a fainting spell. When I recovered, my vision swirled, and I heard the sound of cicadas in my ears; my spirit felt absent, as if I were alone, detached from the crowd, like an eagle soaring in the vast sky, or a boat unmoored, drifting between the Three Gorges and the deep seas, unable to restrain myself. I heard of Master Zhu from Danxi, whose name was renowned everywhere, and urgently summoned him for treatment. When the master arrived, after taking my pulse, he said: &quot;Internally, your essence is shaken; externally, your form is strained, depleting your yin and consuming your vitality. You should withdraw your gaze and listen within the vast court of the Void; relying solely on medicine is not sufficient.&quot; He then instructed his senior disciple, Jia Junsicheng, to stay and take care of me. Jia treated me as if I were his own sibling, attending to my needs in every way. If he suspected my anger was excessive, he would treat me with sadness; if he thought I was too sad, he would treat me with joy; if my joy was excessive, he would address it with fear; if my fear was excessive, he would evoke contemplation; if my contemplation was excessive, he would counter it with anger.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In ancient times, physicians had to be well-versed in the texts of the three generations. The so-called three generations are: first, the &quot;Acupuncture and Moxibustion,&quot; second, the &quot;Shennong&#39;s Materia Medica,&quot; and third, the &quot;Great Fundamental Pulse Treatise.&quot; The pulse treatise is for observing evidence, the materia medica is for distinguishing drugs, and acupuncture and moxibustion are for eliminating diseases. Without these three, one cannot be called a physician. Therefore, it is said in the records of rituals: &quot;A physician who does not understand the three generations will not be trusted with their medicine.&quot; The transmitters of the classics clearly state their doctrines and refute the fallacies, using the concept of father and son passing down through three generations as a reference. How perplexing that is! The art of medicine requires deep contemplation, keen insight, and clarity of thought before one can engage with it. Even a father may not necessarily pass down his knowledge to his son.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there is a physician named Yan, who has been in the medical profession for three generations. His medical practice focuses solely on major treatments, ignoring all else entirely. There is also Mr. Zhu Ping, whose family has historically practiced Confucianism, but he first gained recognition as a physician, diligently studying medical texts. A young man was afflicted with lung issues, coughing and producing blood-streaked phlegm. Yan said, &quot;This is a consumption; he will die in three months.&quot; Mr. Zhu disagreed, stating, &quot;No, the qi is rising and becoming abundant, but the central axis is lost; the fire organ is in turmoil, burning like gold in a furnace. This is called lung atrophy; treatment must be administered.&quot; Afterward, the young man indeed recovered.</p>
<p>An old man of sixty suffered from fevers and chills, initially experiencing a slight shiver, his teeth chattering, followed by severe heat, as intense as being steamed in a pot. Yan said, &quot;This is phlegm; if untreated, it will worsen.&quot; Mr. Zhu contradicted him, claiming, &quot;No, the pulse is excess and knotted, the rhythm is chaotic, with an exterior that seems strong but is internally weak; calamity emerges, yet fortune is found at the extreme. This is called the resolution.&quot;<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medicine can cure, while without it, the condition worsens. Eventually, when it becomes severe, treatment can lead to recovery. A woman suffered from a cough and would expel several liters of phlegm, which smelled foul and affected anyone nearby. Yan stated that this was a cold-induced cough and recommended warmth. Pingjun disagreed. He noted that the balance of yin and yang was not achieved, resulting in stagnation of qi and blood, creating a situation with no resolution, which he termed a severe obstruction. If treated improperly, after a long time, the condition may stabilize but could still lead to the birth of a son. His statement proved true later on. Yan had been a physician for three generations, while Pingjun was just beginning, raising questions about the merit of their practices. </p>
<p>Alas! There were many renowned physicians in the past, too numerous to mention. Among them were Hua Yuanhua, Zhang Sibao, and Xu Zhizang, whose treatments and results were remarkable, and one never heard of their familial lineage passing down. Yet, for three thousand years, the interpretations of medical texts have clouded the principles of the &quot;Book of Rites,&quot; obscuring clarity. Those seeking medical help do not inquire about the profundity of the texts but follow practitioners they see persevering in their work, regardless of their expertise. When questioned, they say this is what the keepers of rituals suggest. Is this acceptable? </p>
<p>Ge Sheng, from a prominent family in Huai, was skilled in medicine and had studied the writings of three generations, practicing and mastering them. He treated ailments effectively, determining life or death with results as accurate as if he were consulting an unerring oracle. Scholars who might be unable to adequately provide medicine would nonetheless dispense it without seeking compensation, and the virtuous gentlemen would universally commend him. He was awarded the seventh rank robe and appointed to oversee the medical officers, with people relying on him for their lives. Oh! Is Ge Sheng not one who bears no shame before the ancient physicians?<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Preface to the Gift for Physician Jia</strong></p>
<p>The way of medicine has been difficult to articulate for a long time. However, one must carefully diagnose to establish measurement, set standards, weigh and balance, match colors and pulses, and observe the excesses and deficiencies, as well as the harmonious and contrary states. This must be coupled with the patient&#39;s movements and their breathing, after which one can treat them; thus, the matter is indeed of great seriousness. If one does not have a deep understanding of the gains and losses in the multitude of written works, can one still engage in this? </p>
<p>The &quot;Huangdi Neijing,&quot; although suspected to have been emulated and attributed to figures of pre-Qin times, contains profound words and deep meanings, and its examinations are credible and well-evidenced, making it a foundational text for physicians. Below this, we have texts from the people of Qin and Yue, which are gentle, yet there are no books to pass down. The work &quot;Bajiyi Nanjing&quot; by the Yue people primarily expounds upon the essentials of the &quot;Neijing.&quot; Further down, there are the teachings of Chunyu Yi and Hua Tuo, which are also part of the art of guiding. The practice of opening the abdomen to treat illnesses involves mystical elements. Sima Qian thoroughly documented the state of medical conditions, yet the so-called &quot;strange wind&quot; and &quot;mysterious wind&quot; are completely unknown to contemporary people, let alone searching for the profound meanings of treatment. Below this, we find Zhang Ji, whose &quot;Jinkui Yuhan Jing&quot; and discussions of typhoid diseases are indeed timeless classics. However, it primarily details injuries from the six qi and the resulting emotions, diet, and exertion, without thoroughly discussing these points, compounded by the difficulties in sequentially following the disordered and simplified text. Below him is Wang Shuhe.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p></div>

Unfortunately, it was trivialized by some superficial individuals into a simplistic pulse song, preventing the original work from being widely disseminated. Following him was Chao Yuanfang, whose &quot;On the Source of Illnesses&quot; appears not to have been unwitnessed, as it discusses wind, cold, and two types of dampness, but neglects the topic of damp-heat, which is a flaw. Next was Wang Bing, who advanced the understanding of the changes in the five movements and six atmospheres, compiling the &quot;Heavenly Origin Jade Strategy,&quot; which is comprehensive and meticulous, yet difficult for people; should one cling too rigidly to it, they would become stagnant and disconnected.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the liver has excessive fire, it leads to leakage without nourishment; the kidneys, being true water, provide nourishment without leakage. This reveals the secrets of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; an understanding particularly important for those who know how to apply it. The world generally perceives it through the lens of infantile medicine, showing how shallow their understanding is. The writings that have been lost and collected by Yan Xiaozhong are largely influenced by his perspective and are not the original truth of the teachings. Below him are Zhang Yuanshu of Shanggu, Liu Wansheng of Hejian, and Zhang Congzheng of Suishui. Although Yuanshu and Wansheng set up unusual dreams and extraordinary figures to enhance their teachings, they were indeed inspired by the principles of the original teachings. Zhang Congzheng, on the other hand, is primarily a follower of Wansheng. </p>
<p>Yuanshu’s methods, which combined ancient formulas with new ailments, could not align with the past; he did not treat diseases according to formulas, which is why his writings did not circulate. What remains today has largely been shaped by later interpretations. The understanding of these principles has been deeply grasped by Dong Yuan and Li Gao. Gao clarified the internal and external injuries, placing significant emphasis on the importance of nourishing the spleen. He viewed the spleen as the central organ of the body, asserting that when it is balanced, all organs are balanced as well. Zhang Congzheng advocated for three methods involving vomiting, sweating, and purging for treatment, considering six critical factors of wind, cold, heat, damp, fire, and dryness—key aspects of medical practice. His treatments were often aggressive, and the remedies harsh; those unskilled in these methods risked causing death. Wansheng discussed diseases caused by wind and fire using the nineteen conditions from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; which served as the basis for &quot;Original Disease Patterns.&quot; This was concise and profound, difficult for the majority of practitioners to emulate. Upon examining how these methods were established, they mostly revolved around the dual principles of replenishment and aggression.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

He who has not yet had time for an in-depth discussion, I will address what is currently being discussed: Do the physicians of this world truly apply themselves fully to this? If they have not done so, how can they measure, establish standards, weigh, and assess pulse and color? It is nearly unimaginable that they would treat human life so lightly. Nevertheless, there is something essential here regarding the concepts of opposition and compliance. That which is called rising and falling, floating and sinking, I will follow; that which is called warming and cooling, cold and heat, I will oppose.

He once studied with Master Lian under the guidance of Mr. Wen from the southern city, learning to interpret the classics. After some time, Sicong left to pursue medical teachings at the door of Mr. Yanxiu Zhu. He explored all that was written by the Confucian scholars, and upon venturing out to treat ailments, often achieved remarkable results. Among the gentry, he frequently composed poetry and asked Lian for prefaces. If Lian was not knowledgeable about medicine, how could he be informed of Sicong’s achievements? Yet Sicong, tirelessly seeking assistance, straightforwardly discussed the successes and failures of ancient texts, encouraging Sicong to study in this manner.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>I have observed that in recent times, no place has praised physicians more than Wu region. Among the physicians of Wu, none is more renowned than the Ge family. The medical practice of the Ge family excels in discerning the rise and fall of the five movements and six qi, using this to analyze illness and determine treatment methods. This is the art of Zhongzheng, which sets him apart from others. </p>
<p>Indeed, one of Zhongzheng&#39;s uncles, known as Hengzhai, once authored a book, stating that medicine should consider the fluctuations of time to determine what is to be added or diminished. Liu Shouzheng, Zhang Zihe, and others practiced their art during a time of strength for the Jurchens, when the people were robust and fierce, and thus often employed methods of release. However, as times became weak, with the aftermath of war and famine causing hardship, Zhang Jiegu, Li Ming and their peers tended to focus more on restoration and nourishment. </p>
<p>By the time of the Song dynasty, physicians generally aimed to preserve vital qi but did not comprehend the necessary offense. They could nurture diseases but not cure them, failing to understand the transformations involved. Such discussions illustrate an understanding of the changes in qi movements and the implications of yin and yang transformations.</p>
<p>As for modern physicians, they are filled with benevolence and righteousness. They have extensively studied various texts and are proficient in the Taoist arts. They are well-versed in the principles of yin and yang, and have a clear understanding of qi dynamics. They differentiate medicines by their warming or cooling effects and assess the pulse for superficial or interior conditions. Their treatment employs supplements or purges based on a careful examination of the illness&#39;s nature—whether it is deficiency or excess. They tailor their prescriptions according to the illness and administer remedies accordingly. Their clever techniques are instinctive, adapting fluidly without rigidity. They do not seek to enhance their reputations but aim merely to benefit others. They do not calculate personal gain or profit, and regardless of wealth or poverty, they apply the same remedies. Their ability to bring the dead back to life is as profound as the heavens and earth. Such enlightened physicians will have their names celebrated for generations to come.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　今之庸医，衒奇立异。不学经书，不通字义。妄自矜夸，以欺当世。争趋人门，不速自至。时献苞苴，问病为意。自逞以能，百般贡谀。病家不审，模糊处治。不察病源，不分虚实。不畏生死，孟浪一时。忽然病变，急自散去。悞人性命，希图微利。如此庸医，可耻可忌。<br>　　　　病家箴 【前人】</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Admonitions for Inferior Physicians</strong></p>
<p>Today&#39;s inferior physicians flaunt their oddities, lacking knowledge of classical texts and understanding of characters. They self-promote to deceive the world, rushing to people&#39;s doors without invitation. They present banal remedies and ask for ailments superficially. They boast of their abilities, indulging in flattery. Patients do not examine their issues, treating their ailments vaguely. They do not investigate the origins of their illnesses or distinguish between true and false conditions. They disregard life and death, acting recklessly in the moment. Suddenly, illnesses worsen and they hastily disperse. They endanger lives for minimal profit. Such inferior physicians are shameful and to be feared.</p>
<p><strong>Admonitions for Patients</strong></p>
<p>Today&#39;s patients are often stingy with their expenditures. They refuse urgent treatment, waiting for self-recovery. They do not seek the wise but hope for the easy solution. They overlook their conditions, carelessly trying various remedies. Some even invoke spirits, which leads to nothing worthwhile. Stepping on frost without caution invites the hard ice. By the time they seek skilled physicians, their illnesses have become severe. Even if there are miraculous elixirs, they are hard to cure. Their ignorance and delay result from their own actions. They only resign to fate, thinking luck will improve. Such confusion is truly lamentable. These patients must rectify this folly.</p>
<p><strong>Warnings for Physicians</strong></p>
<p>The weight of human life is immense, and the role of a physician is the most challenging. The source of illness must be thoroughly investigated, and medicines must be prescribed with care. One should achieve complete treatment and not linger over years. Life and death are crucial matters known only to heaven. Compassionate colleagues should think deeply about their duty to help the world.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Original Path of Medicine</p>
<p>Great is medicine! Its origins are far-reaching! Since the chaos was separated and the wilderness began to take shape, the light and clear aspects of yang rose to form heaven, while the heavy and turbid aspects of yin descended to form earth. Heaven flourished and took its place above, while earth sank and took its place below. Thus, the essence of yang became the sun, rising in the east and setting in the west; the essence of yin became the moon, visible at night and hidden during the day. The dual principles stood firm, and the two luminaries moved in their courses. At this point, the primal energy condensed in the void, and water began to emerge; the red energy radiated through the void, and fire began to emerge; the azure energy floated in the void, and wood began to emerge; the white energy traversed the void, and metal began to emerge; the black energy met in the void, and earth began to emerge. With the five elements complete, myriad things were born, establishing the way of the three origins. Therefore, in human life, one must obtain the righteous energy of heaven and earth. The head is round, resembling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. Heaven has yin and yang, and humans have qi and blood. Heaven has five elements, and humans have five organs. The people of the divine Tian clan lived in nests in caves, subsisting on raw flesh and drinking blood. They moved to avoid the cold and took refuge in shadows to escape the heat. When the great simplicity had not yet opened, what ailments could there be? Later, Fuxi observed the heavens and the energy, and created hexagrams. In later generations, there emerged the &quot;Heavenly Origin Jade Book,&quot; regarded as Fuxi&#39;s text, which was recited and passed down orally for ten generations. Shennong tasted all the herbs, experiencing seventy poisons in a single day; thereafter, the study of herbal medicine flourished.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yellow Emperor donned his robes and ruled the world, engaging in dialogue with Qi Bo, the Heavenly Master, to discuss profound questions. They explored celestial phenomena above and the geography below, aiming to alleviate the suffering of the people. Thus, the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; was created. Once this text was established, when people fell ill, they would necessarily rely on acupuncture to treat external ailments and decoctions for internal healing. Subsequently, as simplicity vanished and desires grew rampant among the populace, disasters multiplied, and only with potent, minor, chronic, and non-toxic medicines could relief be achieved. The essence of medicine lies within the book &quot;Suwen.&quot; It comprises twenty-four volumes and eighty-one chapters, detailing the principles of vital energy, clarifying the fundamentals of meridians, discussing diseases to address their root causes, and prescribing appropriate treatments—all systematically arranged and presented with clarity and coherence. </p>
<p>Works such as the &quot;Great Treatise on the Celestial Origin,&quot; &quot;Great Treatise on the Six Origins,&quot; &quot;Great Treatise on the Five Constants,&quot; and the &quot;Great Treatise on the Changes of Qi,&quot; along with several chapters on intricate and subtle principles, truly represent a great legacy for ages, a complete path for liberation from bondage, guiding vital energy to save the common people, and aiding the weak to find peace. Below Xu and Qi, generations have found notable figures. Bian Que grasped a few principles and expounded on them in the &quot;Nanjing&quot;; Huangfu Shiyu followed and composed &quot;Jia Yi&quot;; Yang Shangshan compiled the &quot;Tai Su.&quot; Just as the interpretations of Jin and Yuan revealed insights, and Master Qi&#39;s annotations clarified understanding, it is said that a pure source will yield a clear flow, and a well-structured display will cast a correct shadow—such has been the wisdom of renowned physicians through the ages.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Only Zhang Zhongjing, the magistrate of Changsha during the Han dynasty, uniquely sought the root of medical knowledge, exploring subtle meanings, and establishing principles for regulation of rulers, ministers, and assistants. He created medical formulas, articulating the interplay of emptiness and fullness—a true secret not passed down for a millennium—demonstrating the qualities of a great sage and a second saint, with contributions that bridge past and future. Scholars since the Han and Tang dynasties have sought to delve into these profound insights. Moreover, the principles of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; are deep and obscure, with no clear path for entry. Works like Chao Yuanfang’s &quot;The Sources of Illness&quot; and Sun Simiao’s &quot;Thousand Golden Prescriptions&quot; contain elaborate language, yet their principles become increasingly unclear; their prescriptions grow wider, straying from authenticity. Few have sincerely applied the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon Zhu Fengyi&#39;s discussion as the magistrate of Changsha, compiling the &quot;Living Human Book&quot; of Nanyang, Zhang Zhongjing taught that yin and yang should be interpreted as inner and outer, while Fengyi explained yin and yang in terms of cold and heat. A slight deviation can lead to significant errors; while they may have saved many lives, equally, many have died. Fortunately, Liu Zhi’s &quot;Essential Discussions&quot; and &quot;Original Patterns of Illness&quot; have been created, making the principles of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; as clear as the sun and moon. With the creation of &quot;Direct Rectification&quot; and &quot;Illuminating Discussions,&quot; the laws of Changsha have been condensed to essential principles. Transforming the Gui Zhi Ma Huang Decoction into the Double Resolving Powder and altering the Ten Jujube Decoction into the Three Flower Divine Support Pill demonstrates significant contributions to the sage’s teachings.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>At the same time, there were Zhang and others who expounded on the Great Way of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; continuing the rightful source of Hejian and discussing learning with Ma Zhigui, also writing the book &quot;Confucianism and Filial Piety.&quot; They claimed: &quot;In vomiting, there is sweating; in diarrhea, there is replenishment. The sage has only three methods, with no fourth method.&quot; This is an unchangeable, definitive discourse and a profound maxim. Thus, there was the sorrow of Liu and Zhang.</p>
<p>As for Dongyuan Lao-ren, he elucidated the principles of the &quot;Suwen,&quot; adhering to the methods of Zhang Zhongjing, and authored &quot;Ten Books on Rescuing Life and Extracting Essence&quot; for the world, clarifying the pulse and the weights and measures of medications, as well as the rising, descending, floating, and sinking of drugs; hence, there are analogies of righteous and hegemonic methods.</p>
<p>Regarding the Danxi Zhu family, they meticulously researched febrile diseases and internal injuries, with a particular focus on the profound implications of phlegm and fire, achieving remarkable insights. Song Taishi Lian remarked that their collection represents the pinnacle of medical achievement, which is indeed true.</p>
<p>As for my dynasty, it revised the &quot;Da Guan Materia Medica,&quot; created the &quot;Bronze Man Acupuncture Classics,&quot; and the &quot;Imperially Granted Medical Formulas,&quot; establishing the Taiyi Department to assist the sacred self, and appointing excellent physicians to assist the royal court, with the benevolent pharmacy to alleviate the sufferings of the people, demonstrating a heart of compassion akin to that of Xuanqi, surpassing the Han and Tang dynasties. Thus, esteemed physicians continued to emerge.</p>
<p>For instance, Tao Jie&#39;an&#39;s insights on febrile diseases disclosed matters not mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing; Xue Ji excelled in surgery, supplementing the gaps left by Dongyuan; Ge Kejiu&#39;s treatment of internal injuries, and Qian Ying&#39;s pediatric studies, were also not inferior to the Danxi legacy. The accomplishments of scholars in this age are indeed remarkable!</p>
<p>If future students are aware of the essentials and follow them accordingly, the path will be accurate, and the medical doctrine will also be approachable. Therefore, it is said: &quot;To know the essentials is to conclude with a single word.&quot;<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Again [From Predecessors]</strong></p>
<p>A person is like a nation; when ill, one should seek a doctor. When the illness is cured, the medication should cease, as moderation is the proper approach.</p>
<p><strong>Wounds of Du Ying [Song Wang Anshi]</strong></p>
<p>In shabby wild clothes, I can forget my old poverty. I avoid the noise and live near the marketplace, rising dust upon my figure. Engaging with others through humility. Equalizing all things, I toil without shame for my body. My heart grieves in the ground of the past; I shall no longer see this person.</p>
<p><strong>The Second [From Predecessors]</strong></p>
<p>Uncle Du, son of a physician; Jun Ping, the fortune-teller in the market. The desolation of yesterday&#39;s affairs seems to echo the manners of ancient people. In the old residence, rain breeds mushrooms; the new house shifts cold and desolate. Who inquires about life and death? Alas, I am also empty and barren.</p>
<p><strong>To the Physician Deng Xiankuang [Song Yang Shi]</strong></p>
<p>Heaven and earth share one breath, like a melting pot. Clay and soil gather in accordance with round and square. The divine and physical exist in nine chambers, flowing through the nine realms, while the eight winds carry things like sharp weapons. The heavenly record holds ancient meanings; research began long before the Three Sovereigns. Mr. Sang, an extraordinary figure from Yue, who can pass on the art of acupuncture with stone needles? Cheap labor adds more harm than good, often leading to premature death and shortened years. I admire your youthful brilliance in pursuing studies; profound truths are often deeply explored. Hearing of yin brings yang through divine encounters; reflecting on acupuncture techniques feels like setting traps. At the road&#39;s corner, the herbs turn into bait, while a long snake hangs already upon the cart. Alas, I am weak, suffering from many ailments; the room of Vimalakirti feels quite desolate. I wish for you to quickly alleviate the illnesses of the world, to wash away my lingering sickness and restore me to health.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>To Zhu Songpo</strong><br>By Wen Tianxiang of the Song Dynasty</p>
<p>Though I have yet to attain the level of the great physician Wang, I laugh at the yearly injuries from broken arms. The mountains and rivers within the screen appear vivid, while the pines and chrysanthemums in the pavilion have already taken their stance. Delving deeply into silent contemplation of meditation, I quietly face the stringless qin. Thank you for the poem you sent me from the mountain peak; the full garden of plum blossoms plays with the spring light.</p>
<p><strong>To the Shu Physician Zhong Zhengfu</strong><br>By an earlier poet</p>
<p>The Fiery Sovereign gazes upon the myriad of grasses, diverse types abound in the western regions. Wishing for you to gaze upon the towering Min, my tears flow abundantly. In days of yore, people from Qin and Yue traveled from dawn in Luoyang to dusk in Handan. You bring the magpie scripture from the west and also head south. In Jiangnan, there are wandering wings; how could I not long for the old camp? When will we share the imperial winds and the six energies be harmonious and tranquil?</p>
<p><strong>To Peng Tongbo Wei Hetang</strong><br>By an earlier poet</p>
<p>To manage oneself is akin to governing a nation; using medicine is like waging war. A person can preserve the harmony of heaven, ensuring peace within themselves. External evils infiltrate, worse than bandits and plunderers. If one is not careful in their defenses, the enemy will take advantage and become stronger. In ancient times, there were the writings of the Yellow Emperor, much like today’s Six Secret Teachings. The fierce man commands with a strong voice, while the benevolent general relies on support from rare herbs. Feathered robes belong to his followers, who discern the struggle of yin and yang. I point out the differences between life and death, resounding and shaking with power. Daoists govern lead and mercury; the skin and pores are like heavy bolts. In the end, the key is crucial, and the six energies do not dare to intrude. You are currently raising flags and drums, not daring to leave and yet in awe. At other times, I will hang my bow, closing the door to read the Huang Ting.</p>

<p>The wheat rain is cold, while the warmth is coming; the garden flowers fade with the morning.

<p><strong>Poem on Crossing the River</strong> (Inscribed to Dr. Xing) </p>
<p>When the Buddha expounds the Dharma, the Medicine King serves as the mentor. The Primordial Supreme plays with lotus leaves, rescuing those who are in peril. Confucian teachings have long been lonely, though their merit may illuminate the healing arts. Master Xing is adept and talented, establishing his presence at Huangqi. In the morning, he drinks from the Orange Well; in the evening, he drinks from the Long Mulberry Pond. In Jiangyin, there are over a hundred thousand households, each embraced by the spring wind. The lingering waves benefit Wu, and invoke compassion in my northern hall. To handle the paddle is my challenge, yet the clear stream is a delight to hunger. O those who ask about crossing, I am ashamed of your words about crossing the river.</p>
<p><strong>To the Renowned Medical Practitioner Xuanyang</strong> (By Zhang Yu)</p>
<p>Beneath the long bridge, the dragon palace is pressed down; the people on the shore are mirrored in the water. The Taoist sells medicine by the stream, curing the green snake that is the dragon&#39;s son. To repay kindness without accepting pearls of a thousand gold, the dragon lord passes down books from the sea. In front of my door, the support of canes looks like a market; with such marvelous skills, what worries could a three-broken arm bring? Before the white grasses of Yanzhi Mountain in autumn, the chill enters, and tears of golden sores begin to flow. How can I get a golden elixir from you, to carry the jade dragon back to face the enemy?</p>

Hence, Bian Que faced calamity due to his skills, and Cang Gong then hid away and accepted punishment, while Ti Ying communicated through letters, allowing their father to regain peace. Thus, Laozi said: “Beautiful things are vessels of misfortune,” can we say that Bian Que is among them? Those like Cang Gong could be considered to be closer to this idea. **Preface to the Artistic Literature Section of the Book of Han** [Han, Ban Gu] The medical canon originates from the understanding of human blood, vessels, marrow, yin and yang, to identify the root of illnesses and the distinction between life and death. It involves the proper application of acupuncture, stones, herbs, and heat, harmonizing various medications according to their appropriateness. The acquisition of benefits is like that of using a kind stone to extract iron, utilizing materials accordingly. Those who are unskilled may misunderstand the principles, mistaking recovery for severity, and life for death. The classical formulas are based on the temperature of herbs and stones, assessing the depth of illnesses, using the taste of medicine, tailored to the response of the body, distinguishing between the five bitter and six pungent flavors, balancing water and fire to unblock and resolve issues, restoring harmony. If one loses their appropriateness, they might exacerbate heat with heat or cold with cold, injuring their essence internally, which is a unique loss. Hence, it is said: “There are illnesses that go untreated but often result in the use of traditional Chinese medicine.”"},{"anchor":"trans-2p","marker":"2p","type":"translation","text":"Those skilled in the art of healing are essential tools for life, serving as a safeguard of royal authority. In ancient times, there were Qi Bo and Yu Fu; in the middle ages, there were Bian Que and Qin He. They addressed illness and governance, using diagnosis to understand administration. During the rise of the Han dynasty, there was Cang Gong, yet today, his techniques are obscure. Therefore, I discuss his texts to introduce the art of healing. Encouragement for Physicians: In the realm between heaven and earth, humanity is the most intelligent. What people value most is life. Although lifespans vary, whether short or long, the whims of temperature and appetite lead to different ailments, causing untimely death; thus, neglecting one’s nature can destroy health. The key to rescuing from these afflictions truly lies in effective prescriptions. Therefore, it is crucial for the esteemed physician to be well-versed in the classics, as the great masters are honored as the kings of medicine. Just as the enlightened one can alleviate suffering, they can only treat the disruptions of the four elements. There are also poets who praise the beauty of Pengcheng, the gentleness of the Qin state, the encounter of Ji Liang with the Lu family, and the meeting of Guo Zi with the people of Yue. Finally, with the long-lasting pursuit of immortality and the wondrous path, one can still transform the six into one using golden elixirs and refine the three into seven using silver pills. They gather secrets in jade boxes and explore the profound wisdom of ancient texts. What is peach gum? The Northern Dipper cannot hide its form."},{"anchor":"trans-3p","marker":"3p","type":"translation","text":"The golden paste is not far; the bright pearl is still ashamed of its price. It can make the sounds of the drums resonate beneath the door of the family business, and even beside the solemn offerings, the sound of the flute lingers. In the Zhou Li, the physician is in charge of the ailments of the people; for every citizen who is ill, they are treated in accordance with their afflictions. At the end of the year, each physician records their treatments and submits them, to know what has healed and what has not, as a caution for future practice. As for studying the essence of the original principles, and examining the Confucian traditions, one may spend all day in clear discussions and all night in rigorous study. At the beginning of learning, one may still cling to flattery; as one accumulates achievements, only then does one earn the title of teacher. With the passing of days and months, one can be called a scholar of great learning; even after mastering the classics, one still needs deep discussions. The net of knowledge must be wide, and the hooks of understanding must be deep; if one is satisfied and not awake, then the days are simply not enough. Moreover, when composing poetry, one must often discern the essence, whether ancient or modern, refined or popular, everything must be observed closely, with a detailed understanding of what to take and what to leave behind; then the beautiful phrases may emerge, and the exquisite cadence will come to life."},{"anchor":"trans-4p","marker":"4p","type":"translation","text":"Can one master poetry without guidance from texts, or understand the Book of Changes without discussing it? Yangzi Yun said: \"Read a thousand poems, and then you can write poetry.\" How much more so for the path of medicine, where the nine divisions of diagnosis are quite intricate, and understanding the properties of a hundred medicines is difficult. Observing colors and discerning sounds, their effectiveness is deeply secret; in autumn, ailments can be subtle, and in summer, sufferings are hard to identify. When compared to the practitioners, there has never been thorough agreement or discussion; often, in youth, scholars skim the surface, knowing vaguely that licorice is sweet and cassia is spicy, thinking this is enough for their practice. Yet, the established methods are disregarded; they read Zhuangzi in the same year, while others favor the Book of Changes. However, when patients seek my help, I still cannot fully achieve the desired treatment, even if I cannot reach the source, it can still benefit myself. Therefore, if there are no barriers of social status, and one diligently enhances their knowledge with past experience, they can indeed unravel the complexities. Daily learning what is lacking, one can compose brilliant techniques, yet I would still say it cannot be done."},{"anchor":"trans-5p","marker":"5p","type":"translation","text":"There are many who treat illnesses, but they often respond carelessly and indiscriminately. Those who truly care for others are rare. Thus, one may spend days traversing various methods and months honing countless techniques, yet they have never truly respected the efficacy of their medicines, leaving matters of life and death to chance. Their superficial accomplishments are of no real value. When love runs deep among kin, and feelings are intense, but ailments arise in critical areas, and diseases manifest severely, even if one wishes to exert their full efforts to heal, they find that there are no results. Why is this? It is because they lack foundation in these matters and are thus difficult to change. Certain herbs like hu ma (flaxseed) can only alleviate headaches, while others like mai qu (barley) and qiong huan (spicebush) may counteract specific ailments. If one fails to recognize their place and is constrained by their circumstances, how can they hope to resuscitate the dead in the capital and gain fame among the elite? Such aspirations are unattainable. The path of healing is genuinely challenging—this is a stark reality. It is indeed necessary to contemplate these thoughts and elevate what is good. This is not only about leaving a name for future generations; it is also an act of profound merit. Comparing it to freeing a single pigeon on a scale or reviving ten thousand fish in a pond is not something that can be discussed in the same breath."},{"anchor":"trans-6p","marker":"6p","type":"translation","text":"**On Medicine** by Li Hua (Tang Dynasty) The Duke of Jin was planning to invade Qin, but soon fell ill. The Duke of Qin sent a physician, He, to examine him. Before he set off, he cautioned, \"With neighboring countries in conflict, how can a physician proceed with his task?\" He replied, \"I do not dispense medicine or herbs; I will use words to cure the Duke of Jin so that the nation suffers no harm.\" The Duke of Qin was pleased and honored him with a grand send-off. Upon arriving in Jin, the physician found the Duke in a luxurious setting, surrounded by more than a hundred attendants adorned in jewels, while chefs prepared feasts in the courtyard before inviting guests. The physician declined, saying, \"I was commissioned by my lord to remedy your illness. Now, the great country has turned to appearances and meals to treat me; this is beyond my capacity.\" The military officials replied, \"This is how our lord honors you, not an oversight, please respect our customs.\" The physician said, \"I have journeyed a thousand miles at great physical strain and lack energy. All I desire is one cup of wine, a dish of fruit, and some light side dishes to accompany my meal; I don't wish to burden your great country with more.\" Having respectfully accepted their offerings, he examined the Duke and said, \"Your voice is hoarse and waning, your energy is turbulent and superficial, your complexion is cold yet your build is robust.

Jin cannot compete with Qi and Qin.\" The Duke of Jin said: \"I have never ventured into Chu and am unfamiliar with its king. I wish to hear about that country.\" The guest said: \"Your Grace, I do not recall delving into the details of Chu's boundaries either; I can only speak of what I have seen. Chu is near the outskirts, about three hundred miles from Ying. If you drive a cart up the hill, you can see the various palaces; the red and white hues illuminate the heavens, yet you cannot see the sky above. Like floating water, half is within; the waves of the vast water sway, rising and falling with the wind. The majestic southern peaks, pine trees are everlasting; sometimes lurking, sometimes rising, creating a varied landscape of heights and depths. Flowing clouds shift in weight, at times vanishing, at times brightening; the roads stretch and wind, surrounding mountains and rivers. The cart covers seems like a pavilion as you ascend the high ground; the red sky looms overhead, and you raise your hand to touch the heavens. What appeared high is now beneath the cart; the dark valley is shrouded, stones thrown make no sound. Describing its inner pastures, the mountains darkly frame the doors, with a hazy and jagged view, as if strong blades and curtains were to come apart and come together again.

Through cliffs, rushing torrents rush forth and leap away; initially thought reachable, suddenly seeming boundless. Whirling and sliding, swirling in eddies; stones rolling against fortifications, fire igniting on the riverbanks. Confirmed as tamed and yet turbulent, sand spilling into waves; white smoke faintly blue, waters stretching into view. Faintly vibrant, lasting long enough to form boundaries; soft rain falls, clouds rise in the dark. Spring is born in the Yuan and Xiang rivers, evening arrives in Cangwu; sound and silence end, color follows the distant gaze. Water plants and lotus flowers create a delicate embroidery across the river. Astonished by the multitude of bird names, they disperse and unite upon the water; drifting downstream, sometimes resisting the waves to return. Roaring and terrifying like thunder, clouds rise and churn; neither harms the other, appearances are serene in leisurely grace. By the riverbank, they repeatedly observe, reflecting the river into a rosy haze; clear water ripples, with depths revealing sand; beside the corridors, overflow drenches the railings.

It is disgraceful not to be connected, measured by grains; the stores of grain were half that of commoners; the expenses for feeding horses doubled the rent collected. The remaining lavish wealth and extravagant maintenance were on par with this. The King of Chu was very secure, yet the people of Chu were very ill; Shén Shūqǐ aged but did not engage in governance. Before finishing his words, the Duke of Jin let out a breath and stretched his hand, saying: \"Sir, your good fortune is indeed possible, why is that?\" The guest replied: \"This is not enough to burden Chu, hence I say it is possible. But if it expands endlessly, then it is not possible.\" The Duke of Jin’s countenance changed, strength surged within him; he dismissed the attendants, withdrew the meal shamefully, and requested, saying: \"Sir, you finally mention the ills of your humble servant, I am fortunate to have heard this.\""},{"anchor":"trans-11p","marker":"11p","type":"translation","text":"The guest, riding at the right time, said: \"The ruler of Chu has sent the Commandant Sima to manage the troops at the northern border, threatening our city.

Chu relies on its wealth and strength, and indulges in desires that are not sufficiently frightening. The ruler then mobilized resources to provide aid to the borders, while the smaller rulers sought to ensure supplies for the four seasons. The ruler remarked: 'This aid is given by people and returned to people; without people, there would be none of this. What is there to cherish?' He then ordered the senior nobles to distribute money to the people and express gratitude, saying: 'I am unworthy, causing your fathers and brothers not to protect themselves against the army of Chu, which is why I have exhausted all efforts for you.' The people of Qin, moved by the ruler's words, wept, and even women and daughters requested to take revenge on Chu. Upon hearing this, the court of Chu withdrew its army by evening. Both ruler and ministers were deeply shocked and accepted their roles under Qin; this was the method of the former kings who did not engage in warfare. The Duke of Jin was perplexed by the events in Chu and, consequently, ceased plotting against Qin.

Generally, any affliction one suffers can be cured, but if left untreated for too long, it may lead to death. One has yet to observe an illness that cannot be cured. In the regions of Ba and Chu, there is a custom of consulting spirits, which has existed since ancient times. When the five elements are in disarray, causing the suffering of severe plagues, it is often said that these are illnesses brought by the seasons and not something medicine can address. Therefore, they pray to the spirits without rest, offering chicken, pig, duck, and sheep in hopes of receiving bountiful blessings. If they cannot recover, they blame themselves for the spirits not coming to aid; if they are fortunate enough to heal, they attribute it to their diligent prayers and numerous offerings. Otherwise, how could they contend with the elements? Moreover, if treatment is delayed, the poison of the illness gradually affects the entire household. Thus, even close friends and relatives dare not approach each other's homes, fearing the spread of infection; children fear their parents, and wives avoid their husbands. Wealthy individuals may still manage to have a shaman protect them, while the poor are left to suffer alone in silence. In such circumstances, not only is the charity of medicine cut off, but even food supplies are also scarce. As a result, those who die are often around eighteen or nineteen, yet the people remain oblivious to the causes. I once inquired about this with others, and it turned out the real issue was the dominance of shamans over physicians. Alas! Can shamans truly surpass all physicians? What they conquer are merely the easily misled common folk. For illnesses are rooted within the body, while spirits lurk outside. Good medicine is meant to treat internal afflictions."},{"anchor":"trans-13p","marker":"13p","type":"translation","text":"Now, if one does not address the ailments within but solely seeks fortune from without, when the situation becomes dire, it is inappropriate to neglect the need for care and inquiry; would this not be a mistake? If crops in flourishing fields are damaged by pests, one must completely eliminate the pests for the crops to thrive. If a household has valuable possessions but thieves invade, the owner must wield weapons to either kill or capture the intruders to protect their wealth. The same is true for the human body: when confronted with the influences of yin and yang and facing illness, one should have a physician examine the sounds, look at the color, check the pulse, and prescribe medicine to address the internal organs, allowing the body to return to equilibrium. If one avoids seeking medical treatment and expects to reap the rewards without eliminating the pests, or seeks to preserve their wealth without driving away thieves, it is utterly unattainable. How much more so for the state, which values medical texts as the utmost priority."},{"anchor":"trans-14p","marker":"14p","type":"translation","text":"During the Yuan Dynasty, the renowned editor Ming Fang issued guidelines for the imperial regions, detailing the conditions of epidemics in meticulous fashion. Later, during the Qingli period, the virtuous Minister Fan Wenzheng suggested that physicians from the capital and other regions gather for lectures and training to improve their skills, thereby eliminating errors and saving lives, which would truly assist in effective governance. However, the common people were unaware of the court's benevolent intentions and instead fell prey to false beliefs, endangering their lives, which was genuinely lamentable. Now, the doctors and scholars are instructed to study the methods of ancient figures like Shen Nong and Bian Que, and come together in the teachings of Qi Bo and Yu Shi to correct wrong practices and eliminate falsehoods, ensuring that treatable diseases do not harm people, thus contributing to the welfare of the populace. Yet, there is concern for the customs of the Ba Cong people, who remain attached to old ways and do not appreciate the miraculous effects of medicine, excessively praying to misguided deities; hence, inscriptions are made to convey this."},{"anchor":"trans-15p","marker":"15p","type":"translation","text":"**Medical Inscription** **(Song Dynasty - Lü Huai)** In the Jin dynasty, there was a man named Wu Tai who was skilled in medicine.

Having mastered his art, he returned to express gratitude to his teacher and sought to broaden his knowledge, displaying a commendable ambition. At that time, I had been exiled and was serving as an official in Puzhong. After fulfilling my duties, I sought to document my thoughts in the temple, and thus I created this medical inscription to commend his dedication and fulfill his aspirations. I knew that what I shared could nourish his goodness. The inscription states: The six qi and five elements are the essence of life; the three regions and nine pulses converge in harmony. In ancient times, there were unique techniques that cleansed the intestines and washed the stomach, using acupuncture to relieve ailments. Observing the roots of the pulse allows one to anticipate and conquer without direct confrontation, to preserve life. Healing the illnesses of the world is akin to holding the reins of a nation, always ensuring that harmful elements do not interfere with righteousness. One must dedicate oneself fully; the heart's deep troubles will surely arise, and if one benefits from the art, even the smallest detail can lead to profound results.

After a month, a hundred ailments arose, with internal heat vexing coldness, and the cough persisted without end—the symptoms were truly those of poison. I sought out another physician, who thought it was heat and prescribed cold medicine. He vomited in the morning and had diarrhea by night, thus he could no longer eat. In fear, he regressed; his symptoms, including severe headaches and various other ailments, worsened, and after trying three doctors, the condition became even more dire. An old man in the village told him: This is the fault of the physician, the excess of medicine! What sickness have you? In life, one relies primarily on qi (vital energy) and secondarily on food. Now, you are consuming medicine all day long, with foul smells overwhelming, while a hundred poisons battle within you. You exhaust your primary source and neglect your supplementary source, and that is why you are ill.

When both the lung and spleen are deficient and fire invades, the illness manifests in reverse, thus it is improper to use tonifying or purging methods. Fortifying metal would mean that metal and fire clash, worsening cough and shortness of breath; purging fire would result in fire not retreating, and nodules would exacerbate. The correct approach is to initially support the vital energy with the Ren Shen Bai Du San and then add a small amount of active illness remedy. I have heard that this remedy has been used without effect, suggesting that the condition is severely reversed and the medication has not reached its target. One should discuss thoroughly with Kuangfu; as autumn cools, recovery may be possible. The pulse condition tends to resist the fiery energy of spring and summer, while it recedes in autumn and winter. It is advisable to only use the tonifying soup while adjusting according to the seasonal variations of yin and yang, the rising and falling, the floating and sinking, the warming and cooling, and the evidence seen for increasing or decreasing dosages. Follow the natural flow for rising and falling, and counteract for warming and cooling. To treat effectively, harmonize what is harmonious.

A physician who does not understand this acts recklessly. Liu’s method focuses on innovation and the removal of any stagnation, adhering to the principle of preserving the natural order without harm. A physician ignorant of this lacks the art. However, those who adhere to Zhang may not fully grasp his profundity, leading them to avoid decisive treatments, resulting in many missing opportunities for recovery. Those who follow Liu may not fully comprehend his essence, risking hasty actions that harm the vital energy and create problems for the future.

Concerning the condition of Kuanfu, the initial symptoms must be profound, as the inflicted area cannot fully discharge at the moment, leading to stagnation and the emergence of new conditions, persisting until now.

Even within a single person, one cannot fully grasp this. For instance, when taking medicine, if one uses the powdered remains of decayed wood and bones mixed as a potion, each will indeed align with their corresponding essences. Therefore, the underlying principle is the same. Thus, the ancients said: the flavor of wood is sour; its roots beneath the earth resemble bones, hence bones are nourished by sourness. The flavor of metal is pungent; metals intertwine with various substances resembling tendons, thus tendons are nourished by pungency. Salty represents water and resembles veins; bitter represents fire and resembles Qi; sweet represents earth and resembles flesh.

Without these three, one cannot be called a physician. Therefore, it is said in the records of rituals: \"A physician who does not understand the three generations will not be trusted with their medicine.\" The transmitters of the classics clearly state their doctrines and refute the fallacies, using the concept of father and son passing down through three generations as a reference. How perplexing that is! The art of medicine requires deep contemplation, keen insight, and clarity of thought before one can engage with it. Even a father may not necessarily pass down his knowledge to his son. In my hometown, there is a physician named Yan, who has been in the medical profession for three generations. His medical practice focuses solely on major treatments, ignoring all else entirely. There is also Mr. Zhu Ping, whose family has historically practiced Confucianism, but he first gained recognition as a physician, diligently studying medical texts. A young man was afflicted with lung issues, coughing and producing blood-streaked phlegm. Yan said, \"This is a consumption; he will die in three months.\" Mr. Zhu disagreed, stating, \"No, the qi is rising and becoming abundant, but the central axis is lost; the fire organ is in turmoil, burning like gold in a furnace. This is called lung atrophy; treatment must be administered.\" Afterward, the young man indeed recovered. An old man of sixty suffered from fevers and chills, initially experiencing a slight shiver, his teeth chattering, followed by severe heat, as intense as being steamed in a pot. Yan said, \"This is phlegm; if untreated, it will worsen.\" Mr. Zhu contradicted him, claiming, \"No, the pulse is excess and knotted, the rhythm is chaotic, with an exterior that seems strong but is internally weak; calamity emerges, yet fortune is found at the extreme.

He noted that the balance of yin and yang was not achieved, resulting in stagnation of qi and blood, creating a situation with no resolution, which he termed a severe obstruction.

Thus, esteemed physicians continued to emerge. For instance, Tao Jie'an's insights on febrile diseases disclosed matters not mentioned by Zhang Zhongjing; Xue Ji excelled in surgery, supplementing the gaps left by Dongyuan; Ge Kejiu's treatment of internal injuries, and Qian Ying's pediatric studies, were also not inferior to the Danxi legacy. The accomplishments of scholars in this age are indeed remarkable! If future students are aware of the essentials and follow them accordingly, the path will be accurate, and the medical doctrine will also be approachable. Therefore, it is said: \"To know the essentials is to conclude with a single word.\""},{"anchor":"trans-42p","marker":"42p","type":"translation","text":"**Complete Works of Ancient and Modern Literature, Medical Section, Volume 519** **Arts and Literature [Poetry]** **Whirlwind Chant** **(Song Dynasty, Shao Yong)** Recently, my frail body is afflicted with illness, how can medicine not be sought?

Generally, as things age, they must fall ill; how can a person grow old without illness? **Illness Chant** **(Previous Author)** If one has an illness, they should seek medicine; if the medicine is not good, the body will surely suffer.

在佛说法时，药王为导师。太乙操莲叶，下救人阽危。儒用久寂寞，其功或明医。邢子利涉才，托迹在黄岐。朝饮苏橘井，夕饮长桑池。江阴十万家，家家春风吹。余波来惠吴，起我北堂慈。傅楫吾所难，清泌可乐饥。彼哉问津人，愧汝济川辞。 赠义兴宣疡医 【明 张羽】
