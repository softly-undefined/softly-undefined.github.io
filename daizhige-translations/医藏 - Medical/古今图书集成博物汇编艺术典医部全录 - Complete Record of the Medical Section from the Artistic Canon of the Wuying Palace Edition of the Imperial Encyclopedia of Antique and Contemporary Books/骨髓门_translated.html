<p><strong>Bone Marrow Door</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Vital Energy Reaching the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>The sage expounds on Yin and Yang, harmonizing tendons and meridians, solidifying bones and marrow, with Qi and blood flowing accordingly. Thus, internal and external are in harmony, and evil cannot harm; hearing and vision are clear, and Qi stands as it should. </p>
<p>If the taste is too salty, the major bones suffer from exhaustion, muscles shorten, and heart Qi is suppressed. </p>
<p>Thus, one should carefully balance the five flavors; this leads to proper bones, flexible tendons, flowing Qi and blood, and tight pores. In this manner, the essence of the bones is profound, and careful adherence to the Way ensures a long-lasting destiny.</p>
<p>Carefully harmonizing the five flavors ensures straight bones and flexible tendons, leading to tight pores, which means Yang Qi arises from Yin essence to serve as an external guard. Therefore, Yin stores essence and rises promptly; Yang protects the outside and provides solidity. Understanding the ways of Yin and Yang, both internal and external, avoids unnecessary toil that harms Yang, regulates the five flavors to nourish Yin, and if one diligently nurtures in accordance with the law, then Yin and Yang will be peaceful, leading to a long-lasting destiny.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of the Six Organs and Their Manifestations</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys are responsible for hibernation, being the origin of storage, and the place of essence. Their manifestation is in the hair, and their nourishment is in the bones, representing the lesser yin among the yin, associated with winter energy. </p>
<p><em>Note: During winter, yang energy is cloistered, and creatures that hibernate lie deeply hidden. The kidneys govern this winter storage, hence they are called the source of hibernation. Hibernation relates to living beings, akin to the birth of yang energy, which occurs when spring heralds the first rise of yang, and hibernating creatures spring back to life. The kidneys are the water organ, storage for the essences of the five organs, thus being the place of essence. Hair is the excess of blood, and blood is the transformation of essence, so its manifestation is in the hair. The kidneys govern the bones, thus their nourishment is in the bones. The kidneys are an阴 organ, yet contain the阳 of the坎, thus they are the lesser yin among the yin, connected to winter energy, which governs water.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Treatise on the Generation of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The kidneys are connected to the bones, their nourishment is in the hair, and they govern the spleen. </p>
<p><em>Note: The kidneys store essence and govern the marrow, hence their connection is in the bones. Hair is the excess of essence and blood, hence their nourishment is in the hair.</em> Excessive consumption of sweet flavors leads to bone pain and hair loss, which injures the body due to the imbalance of the five tastes. </p>
<p><em>Note: Overindulgence in sweetness, being excessive earth flavor, harms the kidneys, resulting in bone pain and hair loss.</em> All marrow belongs to the brain.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br><strong>Note: The brain is the sea of essence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>The brain, marrow, bones, vessels, and gallbladder, as well as the uterus, are the products of earthly energies. They are all stored in the yin and resemble the earth; therefore, they are stored and do not leak, and are called the repository of extraordinary permanence. <strong>Note: The earth master stores and rises, while the heavenly master transforms and descends, indicating that the organs and bodily forms of humans correspond to the energies of heaven and earth, yin and yang. These six are different from the transformative organs, hence they are named the repository of extraordinary permanence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Essential Diagnostic Treatise Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In the case of the Shaoyang ending, there is deafness, all joints relax, and the eyes are &quot;cut from their ties.&quot; When &quot;cut from their ties,&quot; one is one and a half days from death. In death, the color first turns blue, then white signifies death. <strong>Note: The meridians of the hands and feet governed by the Shaoyang flow through the ears; when the qi is cut off, it causes deafness. The Shaoyang governs the bones, and since all joints relate to the bones, relaxation of the Shaoyang qi causes all joints to relax. The meridians of the hands and feet of Shaoyang connect to the eyes; when they conclude, they pull at the eyes, causing the eyes to appear startled and to look askew. &quot;Cut from their ties&quot; means the eyes are severed. The Shaoyang relates to the kidneys, which store the will; if it is severed, the will will first be severed, hence the one and a half days from death. Blue indicates the outward leakage of the Qi of wood, while white indicates the internal loss of the essence of the Sanjiao. For yang arises from yin, and color is born from qi; therefore, the qi of the six meridians concludes before it is first seen in color.</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Essentials of Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;What about the various abscesses, swellings, muscle spasms, and bone pains? How do they occur?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;These are swellings caused by cold Qi and changes from the eight winds.&quot; The Emperor asked: &quot;How do we treat them?&quot; Qi Bo answered: &quot;These are illnesses of the four seasons; their treatment should be based on the principle of overcoming them for recovery.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The principle of overcoming refers to treating conditions with the appropriate attributes of the five elements. For instance, if cold invades internally, it should be treated with something sweet and warming. Similarly, if there is wind arising from the east, as wind generates wood, and wood produces sourness, then pungent flavors can overcome sourness.</p>
<p>For pulses that are fine and deep, all indicate the yin aspect, which corresponds to bone pain; those that are silent are located in the feet. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Regardless of whether the left or right three positions show fine and deep pulses, they are all related to the yin aspects. Specifically, those that are deep, fine, and silent are found in the three yin locations of the feet.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Theory of Human Vitality</strong></p>
<p>The true essence resides below in the kidneys, which store the vital energy of bone marrow.<br><strong>[Note: The original essence of water is stored in the kidneys, which are responsible for housing the energy of bone marrow.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Five Energies</strong></p>
<p>Bitter flavors affect the bones; if bone disease arises, one should not consume too much bitterness.<br><strong>[Note: The kidneys govern the bones, and fire rising causes bitterness. Bitter affecting the bones signifies the downward interaction of fire energy with the kidneys. If one with bone disease consumes too much bitterness, the fire energy will gain the upper hand.]</strong> The kidneys govern the bones; prolonged standing harms them.<br><strong>[Note: The kidneys store essence and marrow and focus on the bones, hence their governance. Prolonged standing can injure the waist, kidneys, and knees, thus harming the bones.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Unbalance</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: When a person feels cold, and neither hot water nor fire can warm them, and thick clothing can&#39;t provide warmth, yet they do not feel unbearably cold, what is the cause of this illness? Qi Bo replied: This person has a strong kidney energy, using water as their foundation; the solar energy is weak, leading to dried kidney essence that grows sparse. One water cannot overcome two fires. The kidneys represent water, which manifests in the bones; if the kidneys do not produce, the marrow cannot be replenished, resulting in cold even to the bones. Therefore, the inability to feel cold stems from the liver’s yang and the heart’s dual yang; the kidneys are solitary organs. One water cannot overpower two fires, hence the inability to feel cold; this illness is called bone atrophy, and this person may suffer from joint contractions.<br><strong>[Note: When the body feels cold and hot water or fire cannot warm it, and thick clothing cannot provide warmth, the exterior is cold due to weakened solar energy. The inability to feel cold is due to the heat of the two yang inside. When kidney energy prevails, it signifies supremacy of kidney water energy.]</strong><a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Those who regard water as their priority have the bladder&#39;s water as superior. When the water is cold and dominates, the vital energy of the sun weakens, and the solitary yin does not flourish. The essence of water is indeed water. When the essence of the kidneys is exhausted and does not flourish, the water of the bladder cannot overcome the two fires. The kidneys give rise to the marrow, and the marrow nourishes the liver. If the kidney&#39;s fat does not produce, then the marrow cannot fill the bones, which is why cold reaches the bones. The liver represents the wood fire of the initial rise of yang. The heart represents the fire of the earthly sovereignty. The kidney is the female organ, the solitary organ. The yin of the solitary organ relies on the solar model for transformation; when the solar energy weakens, the solitary yin does not thrive. The fluids of the bladder cannot overcome the two fires; hence, a person cannot endure the cold if the two yang fires are heated internally. This ailment is called bone bi (pain); the illness arises from marrow depletion and bone pain, leading to stiffened joints.</p>
<p>The Treatise on Bi</p>
<p>When the three energies of wind, cold, and dampness arrive together, they form bi. Encountering this in winter leads to bone bi. If bone bi persists and is further afflicted by evil, it lodges within the kidneys. Kidney bi causes bloating, where the buttocks replace the heels and the spine replaces the head. </p>
<p>(Note: The skin, flesh, tendons, and bones are internally associated with the five organs, and the energy of the five organs is externally associated with the four seasons. Initially, the illness is manifest in an external and tangible form, but it subsequently damages the internal energies of the five organs. The interaction between the external manifestations and internal energies allows evil to reside within. The kidneys are the gateway of the stomach; if the gate is obstructed, the stomach energy cannot circulate, leading to bloating. The kidneys govern the bones; when the bones become atrophied and cannot function, the buttocks replace the heels. Yin ailments prevent one from looking up, hence the spine replaces the head.)<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Weakness</strong></p>
<p>When the kidney qi is hot, the lower back and spine cannot rise, the bones wither, and the marrow diminishes, resulting in bone weakness. The kidneys govern the storage of essence; when kidney qi is hot, the fluids become dried up. The lower back is the organ of the kidneys, which is why the lower back and spine cannot extend and lift. The kidneys produce bone marrow; within the body, they correspond to bones. When kidney qi is hot and essence fluids are depleted, the marrow diminishes and the bones wither, leading to bone weakness.</p>
<p>If one engages in distant travel and labor, encountering great heat and thirst, thirst will consume the yang qi, which in turn will result in heat being transferred to the kidneys. The kidneys are the water organ. If water cannot control fire, the bones will wither and the marrow will be deficient, hence the limbs cannot support the body, resulting in bone weakness. Thus, it is stated in the &quot;Lower Classic&quot; that bone weakness arises from great heat.</p>
<p>Engaging in far travel and labor can harm the kidneys, and encountering great heat can harm the yin. Thirst leads to the depletion of the yin fluids, which causes the yang heat to internally deplete the yin, resulting in heat being transferred to the kidneys. The kidneys are the water organ; when water is abundant, it can control fire. However, when yang is strong and yin is consumed, water cannot control fire, leading to the withering of bones and deficiency of marrow, hence causing the limbs to be unable to bear weight and resulting in bone weakness.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>The Theory of Qi Points</strong></p>
<p>Accumulated cold lingers and does not reside in the body, the protective and nutritive Qi cannot settle within, causing the flesh to contract and the tendons to shorten. The ribs and elbows cannot extend; internally, this leads to bone pain, and externally, it results in numbness, referred to as insufficiency. The great cold keeps lingering in the valleys.</p>
<p><em>Commentary: Accumulated cold lingers, preventing the protective and nutritive Qi from occupying their place. The cold evil stagnates, and without the proper Qi to harmonize it, the flesh contracts and the tendons shorten. The ribs and elbows, being the pivot of tendons and bones, cannot extend. The evil is trapped outside, resulting in internal bone pain. The protective and nutritive Qi operates in reverse, hence the external numbness, termed insufficiency. Hot evils overflow, which indicates excess; while cold&#39;s nature is to solidify and obstruct, resulting in insufficiency. This great cold evil flows among the valleys, causing ailments to both muscles and bones.</em>*</p>
<p>Evil overflows and Qi gets blocked; heat in the pulse leads to decaying flesh. The protective and nutritive Qi ceases to flow, which inevitably leads to pus formation, consuming the marrow internally, and externally damaging the thigh, lingering at the joints, inevitably leading to deterioration.</p>
<p><em>Commentary: This evil resides in the valleys, causing heat. Qi is yang, and the evil lingers in the division of the skin and muscle; when the evil and the correct Qi clash, it results in disease and heat, thus leading to symptoms of pus, decay, and destruction. As the evil Qi overflows, the correct Qi gets blocked; the Qi of the valleys communicates with the pulse, hence the pulse heats up internally while the flesh decays externally. When the protective and nutritive Qi ceases to flow, the blood and Qi stagnate, leading to the formation of pus. When the joints and bones connect, if the evil lingers there, the tendons and bones are inevitably poised for deterioration.</em><a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>On Regulating Menstruation</p>
<p>When the blood and qi have not yet merged, the five organs are stable, and the joints show movement.<br>[Note: The movement in the joints may also be caused by a slight wind affliction.]<br>On the Reversal of the Four Seasons<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The sun is abundant, but disease and heavy burdens afflict the body.<br>Winter&#39;s chill resides in the marrow, for winter conceals, while blood and energy within penetrate to the bones and connect to the five organs.<br>—— Discussion on the Transformation of Qi  </p>
<p>Excessive yang fire leads to overwhelming heat, resulting in body heat and bone pain from immersion.<br>[Note: Body heat and bone pain arise from excessive fire, which also harms water. Immersion refers to fiery sores.]<br>—— Great Treatise on the Six Origins  </p>
<p>The yangming governs heavenly affairs, the qi transforms and functions postnatally, while the four qi result in disease and weakness of the bones.<br>[Note: The presence of the four qi is due to the cold water of the sun, overseen by the damp earth of the taiyin, causing cold to condense on the outside and fire to be confined within, leading to bone weakness.] Fire confinement produces illness and pain, causing joints to become active.<br>—— Ling Shu (Spiritual Pivot)  </p>
<p>—— Discussion on the Symptoms of Pathogenic Qi in Organs  </p>
<p>An acute kidney pulse signifies bone epilepsy.<br>[Note: The kidneys are yin organs that govern the bones; excessive yin cold leads to bone epilepsy.]<br>—— Discussion on Longevity and Premature Death  </p>
<p>Baogao said: If form and qi cooperate, there is longevity; if they do not, there is early death. If skin and flesh are harmonious, there is longevity; if not, there is early death. If the form is full but the cheekbones are not prominent, the bones are small; small bones lead to early death.<br>[Note: The kidneys govern the primordial yin and yang, which control the bones. If the cheekbones are not prominent, it indicates small bones, which leads to early death, reflecting thin primordial qi.]<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>On the Spirit</strong></p>
<p>Fear that is not resolved injures the essence; if the essence is injured, the bones become weak and withered, and the essence subsequently descends. [Note: Fear harms the kidneys; thus, unresolved fear injures the essence of the kidneys. The kidneys govern the bones, so if the essence is injured, the bones become weak and withered. When the essence descends, the organ&#39;s energy is harmed and can no longer be contained.]</p>
<p><strong>On the Meridians</strong></p>
<p>When the energy of the Foot Shaoyin is exhausted, the bones become desiccated. The Shaoyin refers to the winter energy, which flows and nourishes the marrow of the bones; therefore, if the bones are not nourished, the flesh cannot adhere. If the bones and flesh do not closely connect, the flesh becomes soft and recedes, leading to elongated teeth and dull hair. Dull hair indicates that the bones have died first, and once they are severely depleted, the earth overcomes water. [Note: The energy of the Foot Shaoyin governs the bones; hence, when the energy is exhausted, the bones become desiccated. The winter energy pertains to the pulses of the five organs, which combine with the four seasons and externally nourish the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones. The valleys pertain to the bones, and flesh originates from the bones; thus, if the bones are not nourished, the flesh cannot adhere to them, leading to disconnection. When the bones and flesh do not connect, the bone energy exteriorizes, resulting in elongated teeth. The kidneys govern the storage of essence and the transformation of blood; hair is a surplus of blood, so dull hair indicates a depletion of the kidney essence, leading to the premature death of bones.]<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>On the Measurement of Bones</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao, saying: &quot;Regarding the measurement of the pulse, which indicates the length and shortness of the meridians, how should it be established?&quot; Bo Gao replied: &quot;First, measure the size, width, narrowness, length, and shortness of the joints, and then the measurement of the pulse will be determined.&quot;</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear about the measurements of the average person. For a person who is seven feet and five inches tall, what are the dimensions of the size and length of their joints?&quot; Bo Gao replied: &quot;The circumference of the head bone is two feet and six inches.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: This refers to the measurement of the head bone. The average person indicates those in the world who are seven feet and five inches tall, considered to be of moderate stature in ancient times. A person of moderate stature will also have a head bone that is of moderate size. With the head bone being moderate, the bones of the entire body will be of moderate size as well.) The chest circumference is four feet and five inches, and the waist circumference is four feet and two inches.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>The total measurement around the chest and waist is noted here. The hair covers from the crown of the head to the nape, measuring two inches, and from the hairline to the jaw is one foot long. The distinguished person makes a final measurement. This indicates the dimensions of the skull from front to back and from top to bottom, with the hair covering being measured from the hairline at the forehead, up to the vertex, and down to the hairline at the nape, totaling one foot two inches. The measurement from the hairline down to the jaw refers to the length from the hairline at the forehead down to the two jaws, totaling one foot long. The distinguished person measures from the start to the end of the hairline. It is said that a gentleman&#39;s face is broad and the hairline is high. The hair coverage from the skull to the nape measures one foot one inch. The length from the hairline to the jaw is also one foot one inch.</p>
<p>From the lower throat to the notch in the breastbone is four inches long. From the notch down to the hip joint is nine inches; if this length is exceeded, the lung is too large, and if it falls short, the lung is too small. From the hip joint down to the heavenly pivot is eight inches long; if this length is exceeded, the stomach is too large, and if it falls short, the stomach is too small. From the heavenly pivot to the crossbone measures six and a half inches long; if this length is exceeded, the small intestine is too wide and long, and if it falls short, it is too narrow and short. The crossbone measures six and a half inches long; from the upper part of the crossbone down to the upper edge of the inner assistant measures one foot eight inches.

From the inner ankle to the ground, it measures three inches. From the knee to the back of the knee, it measures one foot six inches. From the back of the knee to the ground, it measures three inches. Therefore, if the circumference of the bones is too large, it is excessive, and if too small, it is insufficient. </p>
<p>(Note: This refers to the measurements of bones when lying supine. The large bones on either side of the throat are called the &quot;deficient basin,&quot; as they resemble a basin in shape, hence their name. The bone at the back of the knee is known as &quot;Guan,&quot; and another name for it is the &quot;tail feather,&quot; which is the coccyx. The length from the deficient basin down to the bone at the back of the knee is nine inches; if it is excessive, the lungs are large, and if insufficient, the lungs are small. The space within Guan is where the heart and lungs reside. The &quot;Tianshu&quot; point is located two inches beside the navel, a point on the foot&#39;s yangming meridian; the distance from either side of Guan down to Tianshu measures eight inches; if it is excessive, the stomach is large, and if there is insufficient length, the stomach is small. This area from the coccyx to the navel is where the stomach and intestines reside. The transverse bone is in the horizontal crease of the pubic region; from Tianshu down to the transverse bone measures six and a half inches; if too long, the small intestine is wide, and if too short, it is narrow. This measures the part from the navel to the lower abdomen, which corresponds to the large intestine. The transverse bone itself also measures six and a half inches. The inner thigh is the supporting bone for the inner leg; the length from the inner thigh to the upper thigh measures one foot eight inches, referring to the measurements of the upper leg. The length from the upper thigh down to the lower thigh measures three and a half inches, which corresponds to the knee joint, also known as the kneecap.)<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The inner ankle, measured from the lower leg, is thirteen inches in length.

The ankle is the junction of the lower leg bones and those of the foot; the inner ankle is on the inside, while the outer ankle is on the outside. From the inner ankle to the ground measures three inches, corresponding to the heel bone. The knee joint refers to the bone in the lower leg, just below the knee. The tarsus is the bone on the upper side of the foot, corresponding to the pulse of the foot&#39;s yang brightness; it extends from just below the knee down to the tarsal area, measuring sixteen inches in length. The term &quot;division&quot; generally refers to the surface of the foot. From the tarsal area down to the ground measures three inches, corresponding to the bones on the sole of the foot. A larger circumference implies a thicker bone, while a smaller circumference indicates a finer bone.</p>

Below the rib bone is the lower rib; the length from the armpit down to the lower rib is one foot two inches. Below the lower rib is the hip joint, also known as the hip depression, located on both sides of the buttocks, at the point of the foot&#39;s lesser yang acupoint. The length from the lower rib down to the hip joint is six inches. From the hip joint to the midpoint of the kneecap, the length is one foot nine inches, which is the measurement of the thigh. From the knee down to the outer ankle, the length is one foot six inches, which is the measurement of the lower leg. The acupoint named &quot;Jing&quot; is on the outer side of the foot, in the depression where the large bone meets the flesh. The length from the outer ankle bone to the Jing point is three inches, and from the Jing point to the ground is one inch. This is the measurement of the bones on this side of the body. </p>

The width refers to the horizontal extent. The distance behind the ear at the wan bone extends from the ear to the back of the skull. The distance in front of the ear at the ear gate extends from the ear to the tip of the nose. This is the horizontal measurement of the side of the head. The distance of seven inches between the two cheekbones pertains to the horizontal measurement of the face.) </p>

Additionally, each section contributes one hundredth, leading to a total of nine inches, eight tenths, and seven hundredths. Hence, it is said to be seven out of nine inches and eight tenths. </p>
<p>This is the measurement of the bones of most people, which determines the length and shortness of the meridians. Thus, to observe the meridians within the body: those that are prominent yet firm, appearing bright and large, contain more blood; those that are fine and deep have more qi.</p>
<p>This section summarizes the measurements of bones to define the lengths of the meridians. The prominent and firm ones are rich in blood, while the fine and deep ones rich in qi. This treatise discusses the relationship between bones and qi in forming the blood and qi of the meridians; blood vessels begin at the kidneys. When the essence of the bones is robust, the blood and qi in the meridians will also be abundant.</p>
<p>Chapter on Resolving Qi</p>
<p>Grains enter and fill with qi; marshes seep into the bones. Bones are related to flexing and releasing moisture, nourishing the brain and marrow, and providing moisture to the skin, which is termed liquid. When the liquid is depleted, the bones cannot flex and release effectively, resulting in pale skin, brain and marrow depletion, leg pain, and frequent ear ringing.</p>
<p>When the liquid is depleted, the bones cannot flex and release properly, failing to nourish the skin, leading to pale hair and skin discoloration. The kidneys govern the bones, and since the marrow connects to the brain, when the brain and marrow are depleted, it causes leg pain and ear ringing.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The brain is the sea of marrow, its upper flow is in the crown, and its lower flow is in the Wind Palace. </p>
<p>Huangdi said: What signs indicate a person&#39;s susceptibility to cold and heat? Shaoyu answered: Those with small bones and weak flesh are prone to cold and heat. Huangdi asked: How can one determine the size of the bones, the firmness of the flesh, and the variations in color? Shaoyu replied: The cheekbone is the foundation of the bones. If the cheekbone is large, then the bones are large; if the cheekbone is small, then the bones are small. If the skin is thin and its flesh is lacking, the arms are feeble and the complexion is shadowy, not matching the color of the heavens but instead appearing dirty and distinct—these are the signs. A person with thin arms has insufficient marrow, making them susceptible to cold and heat. </p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bones; thus, the cheekbones serve as an external indication of the kidneys. Therefore, if the cheekbones are large, then the bones of the entire body are large; if they are small, the bones are known to be small. Thin arms signify a lack of substantial flesh in the thighs and upper arms. The complexion reflects a deficiency that does not match the heavens, indicating a low and dirty constitution. Marrow fills the bones, so if the bones are small, the marrow will not be sufficient. The skin represents Yang externally, while tendons and bones represent Yin. When bones are small and skin is thin, both Yin and Yang are deficient. A deficiency in Yang leads to the manifestation of cold, while a deficiency in Yin causes heat; hence, individuals with small bones and thin skin are prone to cold and heat.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>On the Organs</strong></p>
<p>The meridians are the pathways for blood and qi to circulate, nourishing yin and yang, moistening the tendons and bones, and benefiting the joints. Therefore, when the blood is harmonious, the meridians flow smoothly, nurturing yin and yang, resulting in strong tendons and bones and clear, functional joints.</p>
<p><strong>On Pain</strong></p>
<p>Those with strong bones and weak tendons, soft flesh and thick skin endure pain better, whether from needles or stones, or from fire and heat. Moreover, those with dark and beautiful bones can withstand heat. Those with firm flesh and thin skin cannot endure the pain of needles or stones, and the same goes for heat. </p>
<p>(Note: The skin, flesh, tendons, and bones of a person are all nourished by the yin and yang energies. The lesser yin holds the essence of pre-natal qi, while the greater yang transforms the essence from food and drink, hence the strength or weakness of the tendons and bones, the firmness or tenderness of the flesh, and the thickness or thinness of the skin, all depend on the qi derived from the lesser yin and greater yang. Those with dark and beautiful bones show abundant blood and qi from the lesser yin. Those with soft flesh and thick skin exhibit rich blood and qi from the greater yang. Conversely, those with firm flesh and thin skin manifest weak qi from the greater yang, thus unable to bear the pain from needles, stones, or heat.)</p>
<p><strong>On Yin and Yang and Twenty-Five Types of People</strong></p>
<p>When the foot shaoyang is affected by cold and dampness, it readily leads to numbness, bone pain, and withered nails. </p>
<p>(Note: Externally, the skin represents yang, while the tendons and bones represent yin. When the affliction occurs in yang, it is called wind; when in yin, it is called numbness. The nails are a residual of the tendons, and with insufficient blood and qi, they cannot nourish the tendons and bones, leading to the retention of cold and damp evils, resulting in bone pain and withered nails.)<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p>
<h3>Nine Palaces and Eight Winds</h3>
<p>The wind comes from the north and is called the Great Rigid Wind. Its harm affects the kidneys internally and manifests externally in the bones and the muscles of the shoulder and back, with its essence being cold. <strong>[Note: Prolonged standing injures the waist, kidneys, shins, and knees; thus, it harms the bones.]</strong></p>

<h3>Bian Que&#39;s Difficult Classics</h3>
<h4>Bone Atrophy</h4>
<p>One damage affects the skin and hair; the skin gathers and hair falls out. Two damage affects the blood vessels; the blood becomes deficient and cannot nourish the organs. Three damage affects the muscles; the muscles emaciate, and food cannot nourish the skin. Four damage affects the tendons; the tendons become slack and cannot hold together. Five damage affects the bones; bone atrophy prevents getting out of bed. Those who experience the opposite will recover from illness. If the damage originates from above, bone atrophy preventing getting out of bed leads to death. If it originates from below, skin gathers and hair falls out leads to death. The accumulation of the kidneys is called phlegm rising, starting in the lower abdomen and rising to the heart in a shape resembling a toad, sometimes rising or falling at all times. If it persists for long, it causes wheezing, bone atrophy, and shortness of breath, which can be acquired during the summer on a Bing or Ding day.</p>
<h4>Joint Pain</h4>
<p>If you obtain the pulse of the spleen, the external symptoms are a yellow face, good belching, good thinking, and good tasting. The internal symptom is a moving qi in the abdomen, pressing it is firm and painful. This illness causes abdominal distension, inability to digest food, a heavy body with joint pain, laziness and a desire to lie down, and limbs not responding. If these symptoms are present, it is related to the spleen; if not, it is not.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Sui Hui (Bone Marrow Meeting)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Coffer</strong> (Han, Zhang Ji)</p>
<p><strong>Joint Pain</strong></p>
<p>The patient speaks in a soft voice, with surprise or joy indicating illness between the joints. If there is joint pain with irritation, a pulse that is deep and thin indicates dampness obstruction. Symptoms of dampness obstruction include difficulty with urination and accelerated bowel movements; therefore, one should promote urination. When wind and dampness interact, joint pain worsens, with sharp pain making it difficult to bend or stretch; approaching the painful area exacerbates the pain, there is sweating and shortness of breath, difficulty urinating, aversion to wind with a desire to keep warm, or slight body swelling—this is treated with Glycyrrhiza and Aconite Decoction. </p>
<p>In cases of warm malaria, the pulse feels even, the body lacks chill but feels hot, and the joints are painful, with occasional vomiting; the treatment is White Tiger Decoction with Cinnamon Twig. </p>
<p>A deep and weak pulse at the wrist indicates the bones, while weakness pertains to the tendons; deep suggests the kidneys, while weakness pertains to the liver. Sweating and entering water can injure the heart. Yellow sweat appearing from the joints is hence called joint sweat. </p>
<p>The Shaoyin pulse is floating and weak; weakness indicates insufficient blood, and floating indicates wind; wind and blood interacting causes pain like being pulled. </p>
<p>For a strong person with a pulse that is thick and small, experiencing shortness of breath and spontaneous sweating, joint pain that cannot be bent or stretched, these are all caused by alcohol consumption and sweating in the wind. </p>
<p>If all limbs ache, and the body is thin and frail, with swollen feet, dizziness, shortness of breath, mild nausea, it is treated with Cinnamon Twig, Peony, and Anemarrhena Decoction. </p>
<p>Sour tastes harm the tendons; tendon injury leads to slackness, termed &#39;leakage.&#39; Salty tastes harm the bones; bone injury leads to atrophy, termed &#39;dryness.&#39;<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>When the dry and leaking elements clash, it is referred to as a &quot;broken leak.&quot; When the vital energy does not flow, and the protective energy does not stand alone, both the nourishing and protective energies become weak. The three burners have nothing to govern, the four dependencies are severed, the body becomes emaciated, the feet swell, yellow sweat appears, and the shins feel cold. If there is heat, it can lead to painful joints.</p>
<p>For joint pain, one cannot bend or stretch; the pain is treated with Wutou Decoction. If there is retained fluid in the chest, the person experiences shortness of breath and thirst, with painful joints in the limbs and a deep pulse, indicating retained fluid. </p>
<p>In cases of sun disease, when the pulse is floating and tight, if the pain is in the joints, coughing, and wheezing occurs without thirst, this signifies spleen swelling, resembling a swelling condition, which can be resolved by sweating. However, those experiencing thirst and diarrhea, or frequent urination, should not sweat.</p>
<p>In the case of wind-water syndrome, the pulse is floating with external symptoms of joint pain and aversion to wind. In sun disease, with a floating and tight pulse, it should be associated with joint pain. If there is no pain, the body feels heavy and sore, and the individual does not feel thirsty. Sweating can alleviate this, indicating a wind-water condition. If a person feels cold, this signifies extreme deficiency that can be mitigated by sweating. If there is thirst without aversion to cold, this indicates skin edema. The body is swollen and cold, resembling rheumatism, with chest constriction leading to inability to eat, gathering pain, and nighttime restlessness. This is called yellow sweat. If the pain is in the joints, with coughing and wheezing but without thirst, signifying spleen swelling, it resembles swelling, which can be resolved by sweating. In all these cases, if there is thirst and diarrhea or frequent urination, they should not induce sweating.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Bone Pain</strong></p>
<p>When Yin evil enters the kidneys, it causes bone pain and lower back pain, pulling upwards to cause pain in the spine.</p>
<p><strong>Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Bone obstruction arises from excessive desires and imbalances, damaging the kidneys. When energy within depletes, it cannot regulate restrictions; when it cannot regulate, both the middle and upper parts become chaotic. When the middle and upper are chaotic, the energy of the three burners becomes stagnant and unresponsive. When the three burners are stagnant, intake of food and drink is not refined; when food and drink are not refined, the essence and energy decline daily. As essence and energy decline, evil energies improperly enter; when evil energies improperly enter, they surge upwards towards the heart and tongue, leading to mutism. If the spleen and stomach are affected, there will be deficiency; if the flow is obstructed in the lower back and knees, there will be lack of mobility; if the limbs are attacked, there will be numbness. If cold is present in the center, the pulse will be slow; if heat is present, the pulse will be rapid; if wind is present, the pulse will be superficial; if dampness is present, the pulse will be moist; if deficiency is present, the pulse will be slippery. The symptoms are not uniform and require detailed understanding. Bone obstruction presents with pain in the lower back and spine, heaviness in the kidneys; one cannot turn over, and if the back of the knees is flat, one will die within five days.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>Joint Pain</strong></p>
<p>Joint pain that arises is due to drunkenness and indulgence in sexual activities. </p>
<p>When there is a disease of the spleen, the complexion is yellow, the body feels heavy with loss of bowel movement, the eyes gaze straight, the lips are retracted, the nails are blue, there is reverse vomiting and food rejection, all the joints hurt, and one cannot lift them; the pulse should be floating, large, and slow, but it is instead tight and urgent; the color is contrary and blue. This indicates a fatal condition, which is unmanageable.</p>
<p>For spleen disease, the complexion is yellow, food is not digested, the abdomen is bloated, the body feels heavy, the joints ache, the stools are hard, and urination is not smooth; if the pulse is slightly slow and long, it is treatable.</p>
<p>In cases of stomach fullness, there is abdominal bloating and difficulty passing stools, joint pain, inability to retain food, and persistent vomiting.</p>
<p>With kidney disease, the hands and feet are cold, the face is red and the eyes are yellow, urination is unrestrained, there is pain in the joints, lower abdominal cramping, and qi rises to the heart, with a slow pulse.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Classics by Wang Shuhe</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thousand Gold Prescriptions by Sun Simiao</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bone Extreme</strong><a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>The extreme condition of the bones is governed by the kidneys. The kidneys correspond with the bones, and the bones are aligned with the kidneys. Furthermore, it is said that encountering illness in winter leads to bone pathology. If bone pathology persists and one is further affected by external邪 (pathogenic factors), it resides within the kidneys. Symptoms include tinnitus and seeing dark colors, which are indicators of this condition. If the kidneys are ill, the bones reach an extreme state, leading to painful teeth, aching hands and feet, an inability to stand for long, difficulties in bending and stretching, body numbness, and sourness in the brain marrow. Seasonal factors such as the winter&#39;s yin water (Ren and Gui) can harm the kidneys, causing wind to disrupt the bones, hence the term &quot;extreme bones.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is deficiency in the qi-yin, the yin becomes deficient, which leads to cold; cold results in a swollen face and darkened features, pain in the lower back and spine, weakness in prolonged standing, and difficulties in bending and stretching. If the qi declines, hair falls out and teeth become brittle, with back pain that increases and causes severe coughing and spitting. If there is excess in the qi-yang, the yang becomes full, resulting in heat; heat manifests as a flushed face, blockage in the bladder, painful teeth and brain marrow, with aching hands and feet, tinnitus, and dark coloration, indicating extreme bone issues. </p>
<p>One must discern between yin and yang, examine the clarity and turbidity of the condition, understand its division, and observe the respiratory patterns. A skilled healer begins treatment at the skin and tendons, and must address these first. If they delve into the organs, it may be too late. As Bian Que stated: &quot;Incurable bone conditions lead to severe pain, immobility in flexion and extension, and death within ten days.&quot; The bones correspond to the lesser yin of the feet; if lesser yin qi is exhausted, the bones become dry and devoid of vitality, leading to the premature death of bones. </p>
<p>Regarding bone deficiency and excess:</p>
<p>If the bones are deficient, they are sore, aching, unstable, and fatigued; if they are excess, they are troubled, hot, and uncomfortable. All responses of bone deficiency and excess are governed by the kidneys and bladder. If there are illnesses in the organs, heat may arise from the bones affecting them, or cold may impact the organs.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>On the Void and Fullness of Marrow</strong></p>
<p>Those with a deficiency of marrow experience headache and restlessness; those with full marrow are brave and fierce. The conditions of marrow’s void and fullness relate to the liver and gallbladder. If there are diseases in the organs stemming from the marrow, heat corresponds to the organs, while cold corresponds to the bowels.<br>— <em>The Ten Books of Dongyuan</em> by Li Gao (Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Distinction between Internal and External Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Internal injuries represent illnesses where the qi of the heart and lungs has been exhausted externally, resulting in lethargy and a desire to lie down, with the limbs feeling heavy and unresponsive. This is due to heat damaging the original qi; the spleen governs the limbs, and when overcome by heat, there is no energy to move. The classics say: &quot;Heat injures qi&quot;; and again state: &quot;Heat leads to bone devaluation and relaxed tendons,&quot; referring to this phenomenon. Conversely, external injuries from wind and cold indicate that the qi of the kidneys and liver has been exhausted internally; the kidneys govern bones and are associated with cold, while the liver governs tendons and is associated with wind. Historically, kidney and liver diseases are treated similarly, as they mutually support each other. Hence, the classics say that the gallbladder governs tendons, and the bladder governs bones. Whether it is a stroke or a cold injury, on the day a disease manifests, one immediately goes to bed and cannot rise; it is not that they cannot get up, but rather their tendons and bones are in pain, preventing movement, indicating a physical injury. The classics state: &quot;Cold injures the form&quot;; and also say: &quot;Cold causes tendons to cramp and bones to hurt,&quot; referring to this. </p>
<p><strong>On Bone Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>The heat from kidney qi gives rise to bone atrophy, hence, the feet cannot support the body. All forms of atrophy relate to the upper parts of the body, indicating that the root of the illness lies in the lungs. Therefore, it must first arise in the lungs, and then heat spreads to the five organs, manifesting as various forms of atrophy.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>Author: Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Bone Disease</strong>  </p>
<p>Pain in the bones from the chest, ribs, hips, knees, extending to the outer ankles, pertains to the lesser yang gallbladder meridian. When there is pain in the knees, swelling in the joints, it relates to the greater yin liver meridian.  </p>
<p><strong>Joint Pain</strong>  </p>
<p>When heat is trapped below and the kidneys are weak, the legs and knees become thin and frail, the joints ache, and the essence is deplete, leading to watery salvation; thirst is less, and the marrow sinks leading to frequent and turbid urination, which is a condition termed &quot;kidney consumption.&quot; If there is joint pain, Qianghuo should be used to dispel wind and dampness. If an obese person experiences joint pain, it is often due to wind-dampness and phlegm accumulating in the meridians, so Nanzheng and Banxia should be used. If a thin person has joint pain, it indicates blood deficiency; thus, Siwu Decoction should be modified with Fangfeng and Qianghuo. If a thin person is impatient and the joints feel warm, it indicates blood heat; thus, Siwu Decoction should be modified with Huangqin and wine-fried Huangbai. For swollen and painful joints with a slippery pulse, it is likely dampness and dryness, and one should use Cangzhu and Nanzheng, alongside qi-moving herbs like Muxiang, Zhike, and Binglang. For those with swelling and pain in joints and a rough, rapid pulse, it indicates blood stasis; therefore, use Taoren, Honghua, Danggui, Chuanxiong, and a small amount of Dahuang for a mild purgative effect. If there is fatigue and weakness accompanied by joint pain, it suggests qi deficiency and phlegm stagnation; thus, use Renshen, Baizhu, Xingren, and Banxia.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Essential Points of Diagnosis and Treatment</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Dai Sigong)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joint Pain</strong></p>
<p>Widespread pain in the joints, severe at night and mild during the day, akin to being bitten by a tiger, is called &quot;White Tiger Wind at the Joints.&quot; The treatment method can be found in detail in the section on Wind. </p>
<p>For symptoms of dampness, characterized by heavy joint pain, swelling, shortness of breath, abdominal bloating and discomfort, and confusion to the point of not recognizing people, the treatment method is detailed in the section on Dampness. </p>
<p><strong>Medical Guidelines</strong><br><strong>(Ming Dynasty - Lou Ying)</strong><a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>On the Essence of Bone</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: The kidneys govern the bones; in the body, they are the bones, and in the organs, they are the kidneys. It is also said: The kidneys unite with the bones, and their essence nourishes the hair. Furthermore, it is stated: The Lesser Yin corresponds to winter, submerging and moistening the marrow of the bones.</p>
<p><strong>The Cavities of Bones</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: The marrow cavities are located three parts behind the brain, beneath the sharp bones at the top of the skull. Wang&#39;s commentary indicates this is called the Wind Palace, which connects to the brain. One cavity is under the base of the jaw; Wang comments that it is located in the concave part beneath the bone, containing a small aperture. Another is in the back of the neck, beneath the bones; Wang notes this is the &quot;Mute Gate&quot; point. There is an empty cavity above the spinal bones, located above the Wind Palace; Wang describes this as the &quot;Brain Door&quot; point. The cavity beneath the spinal bones lies below the coccyx. Lin Yi notes that the &quot;Changqiang&quot; point is at the end of the sacrum, precisely under the coccyx. The multiple cavities of the marrow are found in the area surrounding the nose; Wang mentions this corresponds to points such as the &quot;Zygomatic&quot; points. Additionally, there is a bone cavity beneath the mouth, near the shoulders; Wang identifies this as the &quot;Great Welcoming&quot; point. The two hip bone cavities lie in the yang region of the hips; Wang notes this is near the &quot;Shoulder Yǔ&quot; point. The arm bone cavity is located on the yang side of the arms, four inches from the ankle, between two bones; Wang clarifies this is at the &quot;Confluence&quot; point, one inch from the measurement of the body. The cavity above the thigh bones is found on the yang side of the thighs, four inches above the knee; Wang notes this is beneath the &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; point above the &quot;Yin Market.&quot; The cavity of the &quot;Shan&quot; bone is at the top of the &quot;Assist Bone&quot;; Wang refers to this as the &quot;Calf Nose.&quot; The cavity within the thigh region is located within the hair, below the movement area.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>The coccyx is located four inches behind the hip bone. Wang notes that this refers to the eight lumbar points. The flat bone has no marrow holes and is easy to penetrate without any empty spaces. Wang notes that the flat bone refers to the flat bone between the buttocks, which has porous channels leading to the pores without additional water holes.</p>

<p>Acupuncture</p>
<p>When inserting needles, ensure not to injure the muscles; insert into the tendon and avoid the bone. If piercing the tendon, do not injure the bone; this is called reversal. When the ailment is in the bones, making them heavy and difficult to lift, with sour pain in the marrow and arrival of cold, it is called bone obstruction. Deep punctures should not injure the arteries or flesh. The method involves major and minor pathways; when bone heat disease ceases. Needling the bone without injuring the marrow; if the marrow is hurt, it will dissolve and cause acid, making it hard for the body to recover. In spring, needling and regulating in summer, if the pulse is chaotic and the energy is weak, it penetrates into the bone marrow, preventing recovery, leading to loss of appetite and decreased energy. The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says: Channels treat the bone marrow.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>The large network of the spleen is called the &quot;Great Wrapper,&quot; which emerges three inches below the fluid source and spreads across the chest and sides. When it&#39;s full, there is pain throughout the body; when it&#39;s empty, the joints are all loose. If blood flows through this channel like a net, it all derives from the Great Wrapper pulse. </p>
<p>Needling between the spine and the marrow is for bending. </p>
<p>Short needling involves piercing the bones slightly and then deeper to reach the bone&#39;s essence, working the needle up and down along the bone. Direct needling goes straight in and out, penetrating deeply to the bone to address bone pain; this corresponds to the kidney&#39;s response. </p>
<p>If the hand extends and cannot bend, the issue lies within the bones, situated in the bone&#39;s protection. If the evil is located in the kidney, it causes bone pain and stagnation. Stagnation causes a lack of sensitivity when pressed, abdominal distention, lower back pain, difficult bowel movements, shoulder, back, and neck pain, with occasional dizziness; it should be treated at Yongquan and Kunlun, especially if there is blood involved.</p>
<p>In cases of cold and hot sensations in the bones, the condition is restless, with persistent sweating; if the teeth haven&#39;t decayed, treat the minor yin at the networks in the inner thigh. If the teeth have decayed, the condition is fatal and cannot be treated; bone collapse follows the same fate. </p>
<p>Bone pain leads to the inability to use the joints, causing distress and sweating; the three yang channels should be replenished. </p>
<p>In cases of bone epilepsy, the teeth, flesh, and bones are filled but the bones stay; symptoms include sweating, restlessness, excessive vomiting, and gas leakage; this cannot be treated. </p>
<p>If one feels short of breath and fatigued, with aching bones and a heavy body, lacking energy to move, it requires supplementation of the minor yin. </p>
<p>In febrile diseases causing heaviness and bone pain, deafness, and a tendency to close the eyes, treat the bones with the fourth needle and fifty-nine punctures. If there are bone issues with no appetite, decayed teeth, and blue ears, search for the bones in the kidneys. One shouldn&#39;t seek them in the earth, as &quot;earth&quot; refers to the spleen.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao, &quot;How can one know of the diseases of the bones?&quot; Bo Gao replied, &quot;When the ears are burned and shriveled, filled with dust and dirt, the disease resides within the bones. There are connections within the bones, and it is those connections that allow the bones to benefit and nourish the brain&#39;s marrow. The Yellow Emperor asked, &#39;How can this be addressed?&#39; Bo Gao said, &#39;With the myriad changes in diseases, floating and sinking, shallow and deep, one cannot fully exhaust their understanding; each is in its own place. Those with shallow ailments need less attention, while the more severe require greater attention. Adjust the qi according to the changes; hence, it is said that this is the art of the master. The eight winds can harm people and reside within the bones, resolving the waist, spine, joints, and pores, resulting in deep numbness. Therefore, to treat it with needles, one must lengthen their reach and sharpen their tips to extract the deep evil and alleviate the numbness. In cases of heat disease where the pain is unclear, with deafness that cannot be subsided, a dry mouth, and intense yang heat while the yin possesses chill, the heat resides within the marrow; such cases are beyond treatment. The &#39;Nanjing&#39; states: Where the bones gather at Da Zhu, this is where bone disease should be treated with moxibustion. The &#39;Baoming Ji&#39; states: When all joints ache and the symptoms are unclear, the triangular needle can pierce to the bone and induce bleeding. The &#39;Yixue Gangmu&#39; states: When the tendons are cramped and there is bone pain, one should nourish the Soul Gate. The &#39;Gujin Yitong&#39; states: If the bones are cold and the marrow cold as fire comes to burn, there are miraculous points that must be clearly recorded. The &#39;Suwen&#39; states: If the disease resides in the tendons, one should needle the tendons without injuring the bones; if the bones are injured, it will affect the kidneys. When the kidneys are stimulated, it results in swelling and waist pain during winter.&quot;<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Handbook of Health&quot; states: Zhang Dazhan, aged twenty-nine from Zhen Ding Prefecture, had a long-standing fondness for alcohol. In May of the year 1291, he fell ill with swollen and painful finger joints, and difficulty in bending and stretching; his knees also exhibited similar symptoms. He experienced distension below the heart, a heavy body, a lack of desire for food and drink, and when he did eat, he felt the urge to vomit. His complexion was sallow, and his spirit was diminished. By June, he came to seek my treatment. Upon examining his pulse, it was deep and slow, which indicates a problem with the spleen. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that when the body is heavy and the joints are painful, it is under the spleen&#39;s dominion, as the spleen governs the limbs. His long-term drinking, coupled with the humidity of the season, had caused excessive moisture to flow into the limbs, resulting in swelling and pain. The &quot;Neijing&quot; says that all damp swelling and pain are associated with the spleen&#39;s earth element. Zhongjing mentions that dampness flowing into the joints causes pain and discomfort in the limbs; this aligns with his condition. Therefore, it is advisable to use the Daqianghuo Decoction to treat him. The &quot;Neijing&quot; further states that internal dampness should be treated with a bitter and warm approach, using bitterness to release it and mildness to drain it. It also mentions that wind can overcome dampness. Qianghuo and Duhuo are bitter and warm, penetrating the joints to eliminate dampness, thus they are the primary ingredients. Shengma is bitter and neutral, while Weilingxian, Fangfeng, and Cangzhu are bitter, spicy, and warm, acting to promote this effect, thus they serve as the secondary ingredients. If blood is stagnated and not flowing, we seek to use Chuanxiong which is spicy and warm to disperse it. Licorice assists in energizing and harmonizing, while Zexie is salty and neutral, and Fuling is sweet and neutral; together they guide the dampness and benefit urination, facilitating drainage through mildness. The combination of flavors harmonizes to disperse dampness both upward and downward.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The &quot;Medical Records of Xue Ji&quot; states: Yang Yongxing, dressed in brocade, suffers from soft pain in his muscles and bones, coarse breathing with excessive phlegm, thirst with a liking for water.

I believed he had deficiencies in both spleen and kidney, so I prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction with modifications of Ba Wei Wan, and after more than three months, he was cured.</p>
<p>Tao Tianjue&#39;s concubines were numerous and often suffered from headaches, with excessive phlegm. After exertion, their limbs became weak, and they experienced muscular pain, resembling wind syndrome. I thought it was a case of kidney deficiency unable to absorb qi and return it to the source, so I used the modified Ba Wei Wan for treatment, and they were cured. Later, due to sexual exertion and emotional distress, they had headaches and stiff necks, with pain beneath the ears; this proved to be a case of liver fire syndrome. I continued with the previous medication, nourishing kidney water, generating liver blood, and controlling wind fire, leading to recovery.</p>

During the night, phlegm heat was particularly severe, with itching all over the body as if insects were crawling. This was caused by dryness of the liver meridian and movement of wind. I treated it with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan, adding Shan Zhi and Chai Hu, which resulted in recovery.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　　　黄帝素问</p>
<p>　　　　　生气通天论</p>
<p>　　圣人陈阴阳，筋脉和同，骨髓坚固，气血皆从，如是则内外调和，邪不能害，耳目聪明，气立如故。　　【注　内外阴阳调和，而邪弗能害。精气注于耳，血气注于目，邪不外淫，则耳目聪明，气立如故也。】　　味过于咸，大骨气劳，短肌，心气抑。　　 【注　大骨，肾腑也。过食咸则伤肾，故骨气劳伤。水邪盛则侮土，故肌肉短缩。水上凌心，故心气郁也。】　　是故谨和五味，则骨正筋柔，气血以流，腠理以密，如是则骨气以精，谨道如法，长有天命。　　 【注　谨和五味，则骨正筋柔，而腠理以密，是阳气生于阴精，而为阴之外卫。故曰，阴者，藏精而起亟也；阳者，卫外而为固也。知阴阳外内之道，无烦劳以伤其阳，节五味以养其阴，谨能调养如法，则阴阳和平而长有天命矣。】<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>　　　　　六节脏象论</p>
<p>　　肾者主蛰，封藏之本，精之处也。其华在发，其充在骨，为阴中之少阴，通于冬气。　　【注　冬令之时，阳气封闭，蛰虫深藏，肾主冬藏，故为蛰，封藏之本。盖蛰乃生动之物，以比生阳之气，至春一阳初生，而蛰虫复振矣。肾为水脏，受五脏之精液而藏之，故为精之处也。发乃血之余，血乃精之化，故其华在发。肾主骨，故其充在骨也。肾为阴脏，而有坎中之阳，故为阴中之少阴，而通于冬气，冬主水也。】<br>　　　　　五脏生成篇</p>
<p>　　肾之合骨也，其荣发也，其主脾也。　　 【注　肾藏精而主髓，故所合在骨。发乃精血之余，故其荣在发。】　　多食甘则骨痛而发落，此五味之所伤也。　　 【注　多食甘，是土味太过而伤肾，则骨痛而发落矣。】　　诸髓者，皆属于脑。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>　　 【注　脑为精髓之海。】</p>
<p>　　　　　五脏别论</p>
<p>　　脑、髓、骨、脉、胆、女子胞，此六者地气之所生也，皆藏于阴而象于地，故藏而不泻，名曰奇恒之府。　　 【注　地主闭藏而上升，天主化施而下降，言人之脏腑形骸，应象天地阴阳之气。此六者，与传化之腑不同，故名曰奇恒之府。】<br>　　　　　诊要经终论</p>
<p>　　少阳终者，耳聋，百节皆纵，目　绝系。绝系一日半死。其死也，色先青，白乃死矣。　　 【注　手足少阳经脉，皆循于耳，经气绝，故耳聋也。少阳主骨，诸节皆属于骨，少阳气终，故百节皆纵。手足少阳之脉，皆至目锐眦，终则牵引于目，故目如惊而邪视也。绝系，目系绝也。少阳属肾，肾藏志，系绝则志先绝，故一日半死也。青者，甲木之气外脱也。白者，三焦之荣内亡也。夫阳生于阴，色生于气，是以六经之气终而先见于色。】<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>　　　　　脉要精微论</p>
<p>　　帝曰：诸痈肿筋挛骨痛，此皆安生？岐伯曰：此寒气之肿，八风之变也。帝曰：治之奈何？岐伯曰：此四时之病，以其胜治之愈也。　　 【注　以胜治之者，以五行气味之胜治之而愈也。如寒淫于内，治以甘热，如东方生风，风生木，木生酸，辛胜酸之类。】　　脉诸细而沉者，皆在阴，则为骨痛，其有静者在足。　　 【注　无论左右三部之细而沉者，皆在于阴分，其沉细而有静者，在足之三阴也。】<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>　　　　　平人气象论</p>
<p>　　脏真下于肾，肾藏骨髓之气也。<br>　　 【注　水脏之元真，下藏于肾，而主藏骨髓之气。】<br>　　　　　宣明五气篇</p>
<p>　　苦走骨，骨病无多食苦。<br>　　 【注　肾主骨，炎上作苦。苦走骨者，火气下交于肾也。骨病而多食之，则火气反胜矣。】　　肾主骨，久立伤骨。<br>　　 【注　肾藏精髓而注于骨，故所主在骨。久立则伤腰肾膝胫，故伤骨。】<br>　　　　　逆调论</p>
<p>　　帝曰：人有身寒，汤火不能热，厚衣不能温，然不冻栗，是为何病？岐伯曰：是人者，素肾气胜，以水为事，太阳气衰，肾脂枯不长，一水不能胜两火。肾者水也，而生于骨，肾不生则髓不能满，故寒甚至骨也。所以不能冻栗者，肝一阳也，心二阳也，肾孤脏也，一水不能胜二火，故不能冻栗，病名曰骨痹，是人当挛节也。　　【注　身寒而汤火不能热，厚衣不能温者，太阳气衰而寒在表也。不冻栗者，二阳火热之在里也。肾气胜者，肾水之气胜也。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>以水为事者，膀胱之水胜也。水寒偏胜，则太阳气衰而孤阴不长矣。水精水也。肾脏之精枯不长，而膀胱之一水，不能胜二火矣。夫肾生骨髓，髓生肝，肾脂不生，则髓不能满于骨，是以寒至骨也。肝者，一阳初生之木火也。心者，地二所生之君火也。肾为牝脏，孤脏也。孤脏之阴，藉太阳标本以合化，太阳气衰则孤阴不长矣。膀胱之津液，不能胜二火，故其人不能冻栗者，二阳之火热在内也。病名曰骨痹，病在髓枯而骨痛，故其人当骨节拘挛也。】<br>　　　　　痹论</p>
<p>　　风寒湿三气杂至，合而为痹也。以冬遇此者为骨痹。骨痹不已，复感于邪，内舍于肾。肾痹者善胀，尻以代踵，脊以代头。　　 【注　皮肉筋骨，内合于五脏，五脏之气，外合于四时，始病在外之有形，复伤在内之五气，外内形气相合，而邪舍于内矣。肾者胃之关，关门不利则胃气不转，故善胀也。肾主骨，骨痿而不能行，故尻以代踵。阴病者不能仰，故脊以代头。】<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　　　　痿论</p>
<p>　　肾气热则腰脊不举，骨枯而髓减，发为骨痿。　　 【注　肾主藏精，肾气热则津液燥竭矣。腰者肾之腑，是以腰脊不能伸举。肾生骨髓，在体为骨，肾气热而精液竭，则髓减骨枯而发为骨痿也。】　　有所远行劳倦，逢大热而渴，渴则阳气内伐，内伐则热舍于肾。肾者，水脏也。今水不胜火则骨枯而髓虚，故足不任身，发为骨痿。故《下经》曰，骨痿者生于大热也。　　【注　远行劳倦则伤肾，逢大热则暑暍伤阴，渴则阴液内竭，是以阳热之气，内伐其阴，而热舍于肾矣。肾者水脏，水盛则能制火，今阳盛阴消，水不胜火，以致骨枯髓虚，足不任用于身，而发为骨痿也。】<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　　　　气穴论</p>
<p>　　积寒留舍，营卫不居，卷肉缩筋，肋肘不得伸，内为骨痹，外为不仁，命曰不足，大寒留留　原作「流」，据《素问》气穴论改。于溪谷也。　　 【注　积寒留舍，致营卫不能居其间，寒邪凝滞，又不得正气以和之，以致肉卷而筋缩也。肋肘，乃筋骨之机关，故不得伸舒。邪闭于外，故内为骨痹。营卫内逆，故外为不仁，命曰不足。盖热邪淫溢，是属有余；寒性凝濇，故为不足。此大寒之邪，流于溪谷之间，以致筋骨皆为病也。】　　邪溢气壅，脉热肉败，营卫不行，必将为脓，内销骨髓，外破大腘，留于节凑，必将为败。　　 【注　此邪客于溪谷间而为热也。夫气为阳，邪留于肌腠之气分，邪正相搏则为病热，故有壅脓消破之败证矣。邪气淫溢，则正气自壅，溪谷之气与脉相通，是以脉热于内，而肉败于外，营卫不行，则血气留滞而为壅脓也。节凑筋骨相连之处，邪留其间，则筋骨必将为败矣。】<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>　　　　　调经论</p>
<p>　　血气未并，五脏安定，骨节有动。<br>　　 【注　骨节有动者，亦为微风所伤也。】<br>　　　　　四时刺逆从论<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p>
<p>　　太阳有余，病骨痹身重。<br>　　冬气在骨髓中，冬者盖藏，血气在中，内着骨髓，通于五脏。<br>　　　　　气交变大论</p>
<p>　　岁火太过，炎暑流行，身热骨痛而为浸淫。　　 【注　身热骨痛者，火亢而水亦伤也。浸淫，火热疮也。】<br>　　　　　六元正纪大论</p>
<p>　　阳明司天之政，气化运行后天，四之气，病骨痿。　　 【注　四之加临客气，乃太阳寒水，主气乃太阴湿土，故寒凝于外，火郁于内，而病骨痿也。】　　火郁之发，民病瘈瘲骨痛，节乃有动。<br>　　　　灵枢经</p>
<p>　　　　　邪气脏腑病形篇</p>
<p>　　肾脉急甚，为骨癫疾。<br>　　 【注　肾为阴脏而主骨，阴寒太甚，故为骨癫疾也。】<br>　　　　　寿夭刚柔篇</p>
<p>　　伯高曰：形与气相任则寿，不相任则夭；皮与肉相果则寿，不相果则夭。若形充而颧不起者骨小，骨小而夭矣。　　【注　肾秉先天之阴阳而主骨，颧乃肾之外候，故颧不起者骨小，骨小则夭，此先天之气薄也。】<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　　　　本神篇</p>
<p>　　恐惧而不解则伤精，精伤则骨酸痿厥，精时自下。　　 【注　恐伤肾，故恐惧不解则伤肾脏之精。肾主骨，故精伤则骨酸痿厥。精下者，脏气伤而不能藏也。】<br>　　　　　经脉篇</p>
<p>　　足少阴气绝则骨枯。少阴者，冬脉也，伏行而濡骨髓者也，故骨不濡则肉不能着也。骨肉不相亲则肉软却，肉软却故齿长而垢，发无泽。发无泽者骨先死，戊笃已死，土胜水也。　　 【注　足少阴之气主骨，故气绝则骨枯。冬脉者，谓五脏之脉气，合四时而外濡于皮肉筋骨者也。夫溪谷属骨，肉本于骨也，故骨不濡则肉不能着于骨，而骨肉不相亲矣。骨肉不相亲，则骨气外脱而齿长矣。夫肾主藏精而化血，发者血之余也，发无泽者，肾脏之精气绝而骨先死矣。】<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>　　　　　骨度篇</p>
<p>　　黄帝问于伯高曰：脉度言经脉之长短，何以立之？伯高曰：先度其骨节之大小广狭长短，而脉度定矣。　　 【注　此言经脉之长短，从骨节之大小广狭长短，而定其度数也。】　　黄帝曰：愿闻众人之度。人长七尺五寸者，其骨节之大小长短各几何？伯高曰：头之大骨围二尺六寸。　　 【注　此言头之大骨度数。众人乃天下之人，长七尺五寸者，上古适中之人也。适中之人，则头骨亦适中矣。头骨适中，通体之骨皆适中矣。】　　胸围四尺五寸，腰围四尺二寸。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>　　【注　此胸骨腰骨围转一周之总数也。】　　发所覆者，颅至项尺二寸，发以下至颐长一尺，君子终折。　　 【注　此言头颅前后上下之骨度，发所覆，谓从前额颅之发际，上至巅顶，以至后项之发际，计发所覆者，度一尺二寸。发以下至颐者，谓从前额颅之发际以下，至于两颐，计长一尺。君子终折者，谓从发际之始，以至发际之终，可折中而度量。盖君子之人，面方广而发际高。发所覆者，从颅至项度一尺一寸。发以下至颐，长一尺一寸也。】　　结喉以下至缺盆中长四寸，缺盆以下至骨　曷骭长九寸，过则肺大，不满则肺小。骨　曷骭以下至天枢长八寸，过则胃大，不及则胃小。天枢以下至横骨长六寸半，过则回肠广长，不满则狭短。横骨长六寸半，横骨上廉以下至内辅之上廉，长一尺八寸。内辅之上廉以下至下廉，长三寸半。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br>内辅下廉下至内踝，长一尺三寸。内踝以下至地，长三寸。膝腘以下至跗属，长一尺六寸。跗属以下至地，长三寸。故骨围大则太过，小则不及。　　【注　此仰面之骨度也。结喉下两旁巨骨陷中为缺盆，盖形如缺盆，因以为名。骨　曷骭，骨名，一名尾翳，即鸠尾骨也。自两旁缺盆而下至骨　曷骭，计长九寸，过则肺大，不满则肺小。盖骨　曷骭之内，心肺之所居也。天枢在脐旁二寸，乃足阳明之穴，从两旁骨　曷骭而下至天枢，计长八寸，过则胃大，不及则胃小。盖自鸠尾以至于脐，胃腑之所居也。横骨在毛际横纹中，自天枢而下至于横骨，计长六寸半，过则回肠广大，不满则狭短。盖自脐以至小腹，大肠之部分也。横骨横长亦六寸半，内辅者，内之辅骨也，内辅之上廉长一尺八寸者，在上之腿度也。内辅之上廉以下至下廉长三寸半者，膝之连骸，一名膝盖骨也。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>内辅下廉下至内踝长一尺三寸者，在下之腿度也。曰内辅内踝者，以足八字分立，则内骨偏向于面也。踝者，下廉之腿骨，与足骨相连之凹处，在内者为内踝，在外者为外踝。内踝以下至地长三寸者，足跟骨也。膝腘者，膝前下之腿骨。跗者，足面上之跗骨，即足阳明之动脉处，自膝前而下至于跗面，计长一尺六寸也。属者，概足面而言也。跗属以下至地长三寸者，从足面而下至足底之骨也。骨围大者，骨之粗大也。小者，骨之细小也。】　　角以下至柱骨，长一尺。行腋中不见者，长四寸。腋以下至季胁，长一尺二寸。季胁以下至髀枢，长六寸。髀枢以下至膝中，长一尺九寸。膝以下至外踝，长一尺六寸。外踝以下至京骨，长三寸。京骨以下至地，长一寸。　　 【注　此侧身之骨度，皆纵而数之也。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>耳上之旁为角，肩胛上之颈骨为柱骨，自角以下至柱骨长一尺。肋下臑内为腋，自柱骨至腋中计长四寸。胁骨之下为季胁，自腋以下至季胁，计长一尺二寸。捷骨之下为髀枢，一名髀厌，在臀之两旁，即足少阳之环跳穴处。自季胁以下至髀枢，计长六寸。髀枢以下至膝盖骨内之中分，计长一尺九寸，即上之腿数也。膝以下至外踝，长一尺六寸，即下之腿数也。京骨，足太阳膀胱经穴名，在足外侧大骨下赤白肉际陷中。外踝骨以下至京骨，长三寸，京骨以下至地，长一寸。此侧身之骨度也。】　　耳后当完骨者，广九寸。耳前当耳门者，广一尺三寸。两颧之间，相去七寸。　　 【注　此头侧之横度也。耳后高骨为完骨，入发际四分。广者，横阔也。耳后当完骨者，从耳以至于脑后也。耳前当耳门者，从耳而至于鼻准也。此头侧之横度也。两颧之间相去七寸者，此当面之横度也。】　　两乳之间，广九寸半。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>　　 【注　此形身前面之横度也。】<br>　　两髀之间广六寸半。<br>　　 【注　此形身背面之横度也。】<br>　　足长一尺二寸，广四寸半。<br>　　 【注　此两足之纵横数也。】<br>　　肩至肘长一尺七寸，肘至腕长一尺二寸半，腕至中指本节长四寸，本节至其末长四寸半。　　 【注　此两臂两手之骨度也。本节者，指掌交接之骨节。末者指尖也。】　　项发以下至背骨，长二寸半。膂骨以下至尾骶，二十一节，长三尺。上节长一寸四分分之一，奇分在下，故上七节至于膂骨，九寸八分分之七。　　 【注　此脊背之骨度也。项发以下至背骨者，自项后之发际，至背骨之大椎，计长二寸五分。膂骨，脊骨也，自背骨之大椎，循膂骨以下，至于尾骶，计二十一节，共长三尺。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br>上节每节长一寸四分一厘，其奇分之九厘，在下节计算，故膂骨以上计有七节，每节长一寸四分一厘，则七得七寸四七二寸八分，共九寸八分。又每节一厘，共计九寸八分七厘。故曰，九寸八分分之七也。】　　此众人骨之度也，所以立经脉之长短也。是故视其经脉之在于身也，其见浮而坚，其见明而大者多血，细而沉者多气也。　　 【注　此总结骨之度数，定经脉之长短也。经脉之浮而坚明而大者多血，细而沉者多气。此篇论骨气而结经脉之血气者，血脉资始于肾，骨之精气盛，则经脉之血气亦盛矣。】<br>　　　　　决气篇</p>

<p><strong>Bone Marrow Door</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Vital Energy Reaching the Heavens</strong></p>
<p>The sage expounds on Yin and Yang, harmonizing tendons and meridians, solidifying bones and marrow, with Qi and blood flowing accordingly. Thus, internal and external are in harmony, and evil cannot harm; hearing and vision are clear, and Qi stands as it should. </p>
<p>If the taste is too salty, the major bones suffer from exhaustion, muscles shorten, and heart Qi is suppressed. </p>
<p>Thus, one should carefully balance the five flavors; this leads to proper bones, flexible tendons, flowing Qi and blood, and tight pores. In this manner, the essence of the bones is profound, and careful adherence to the Way ensures a long-lasting destiny.</p>
<p>Carefully harmonizing the five flavors ensures straight bones and flexible tendons, leading to tight pores, which means Yang Qi arises from Yin essence to serve as an external guard.

<p>In the case of the Shaoyang ending, there is deafness, all joints relax, and the eyes are &quot;cut from their ties.&quot; When &quot;cut from their ties,&quot; one is one and a half days from death. In death, the color first turns blue, then white signifies death. <strong>Note: The meridians of the hands and feet governed by the Shaoyang flow through the ears; when the qi is cut off, it causes deafness. The Shaoyang governs the bones, and since all joints relate to the bones, relaxation of the Shaoyang qi causes all joints to relax. The meridians of the hands and feet of Shaoyang connect to the eyes; when they conclude, they pull at the eyes, causing the eyes to appear startled and to look askew. &quot;Cut from their ties&quot; means the eyes are severed. The Shaoyang relates to the kidneys, which store the will; if it is severed, the will will first be severed, hence the one and a half days from death. Blue indicates the outward leakage of the Qi of wood, while white indicates the internal loss of the essence of the Sanjiao.

<p><strong>On the Five Energies</strong></p>
<p>Bitter flavors affect the bones; if bone disease arises, one should not consume too much bitterness.<br><strong>[Note: The kidneys govern the bones, and fire rising causes bitterness. Bitter affecting the bones signifies the downward interaction of fire energy with the kidneys. If one with bone disease consumes too much bitterness, the fire energy will gain the upper hand.]</strong> The kidneys govern the bones; prolonged standing harms them.<br><strong>[Note: The kidneys store essence and marrow and focus on the bones, hence their governance. Prolonged standing can injure the waist, kidneys, and knees, thus harming the bones.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Unbalance</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: When a person feels cold, and neither hot water nor fire can warm them, and thick clothing can&#39;t provide warmth, yet they do not feel unbearably cold, what is the cause of this illness? Qi Bo replied: This person has a strong kidney energy, using water as their foundation; the solar energy is weak, leading to dried kidney essence that grows sparse. One water cannot overcome two fires. The kidneys represent water, which manifests in the bones; if the kidneys do not produce, the marrow cannot be replenished, resulting in cold even to the bones. Therefore, the inability to feel cold stems from the liver’s yang and the heart’s dual yang; the kidneys are solitary organs. One water cannot overpower two fires, hence the inability to feel cold; this illness is called bone atrophy, and this person may suffer from joint contractions.<br><strong>[Note: When the body feels cold and hot water or fire cannot warm it, and thick clothing cannot provide warmth, the exterior is cold due to weakened solar energy. The inability to feel cold is due to the heat of the two yang inside.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who regard water as their priority have the bladder&#39;s water as superior. When the water is cold and dominates, the vital energy of the sun weakens, and the solitary yin does not flourish. The essence of water is indeed water. When the essence of the kidneys is exhausted and does not flourish, the water of the bladder cannot overcome the two fires. The kidneys give rise to the marrow, and the marrow nourishes the liver. If the kidney&#39;s fat does not produce, then the marrow cannot fill the bones, which is why cold reaches the bones. The liver represents the wood fire of the initial rise of yang. The heart represents the fire of the earthly sovereignty. The kidney is the female organ, the solitary organ. The yin of the solitary organ relies on the solar model for transformation; when the solar energy weakens, the solitary yin does not thrive. The fluids of the bladder cannot overcome the two fires; hence, a person cannot endure the cold if the two yang fires are heated internally. This ailment is called bone bi (pain); the illness arises from marrow depletion and bone pain, leading to stiffened joints.</p>
<p>The Treatise on Bi</p>
<p>When the three energies of wind, cold, and dampness arrive together, they form bi. Encountering this in winter leads to bone bi. If bone bi persists and is further afflicted by evil, it lodges within the kidneys. Kidney bi causes bloating, where the buttocks replace the heels and the spine replaces the head. </p>
<p>(Note: The skin, flesh, tendons, and bones are internally associated with the five organs, and the energy of the five organs is externally associated with the four seasons. Initially, the illness is manifest in an external and tangible form, but it subsequently damages the internal energies of the five organs. The interaction between the external manifestations and internal energies allows evil to reside within. The kidneys are the gateway of the stomach; if the gate is obstructed, the stomach energy cannot circulate, leading to bloating. The kidneys govern the bones; when the bones become atrophied and cannot function, the buttocks replace the heels. Yin ailments prevent one from looking up, hence the spine replaces the head.)<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Weakness</strong></p>
<p>When the kidney qi is hot, the lower back and spine cannot rise, the bones wither, and the marrow diminishes, resulting in bone weakness. The kidneys govern the storage of essence; when kidney qi is hot, the fluids become dried up. The lower back is the organ of the kidneys, which is why the lower back and spine cannot extend and lift. The kidneys produce bone marrow; within the body, they correspond to bones. When kidney qi is hot and essence fluids are depleted, the marrow diminishes and the bones wither, leading to bone weakness.</p>
<p>If one engages in distant travel and labor, encountering great heat and thirst, thirst will consume the yang qi, which in turn will result in heat being transferred to the kidneys. The kidneys are the water organ. If water cannot control fire, the bones will wither and the marrow will be deficient, hence the limbs cannot support the body, resulting in bone weakness. Thus, it is stated in the &quot;Lower Classic&quot; that bone weakness arises from great heat.</p>
<p>Engaging in far travel and labor can harm the kidneys, and encountering great heat can harm the yin. Thirst leads to the depletion of the yin fluids, which causes the yang heat to internally deplete the yin, resulting in heat being transferred to the kidneys. The kidneys are the water organ; when water is abundant, it can control fire. However, when yang is strong and yin is consumed, water cannot control fire, leading to the withering of bones and deficiency of marrow, hence causing the limbs to be unable to bear weight and resulting in bone weakness.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Bo Gao, saying: &quot;Regarding the measurement of the pulse, which indicates the length and shortness of the meridians, how should it be established?&quot; Bo Gao replied: &quot;First, measure the size, width, narrowness, length, and shortness of the joints, and then the measurement of the pulse will be determined.&quot;</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear about the measurements of the average person. For a person who is seven feet and five inches tall, what are the dimensions of the size and length of their joints?&quot; Bo Gao replied: &quot;The circumference of the head bone is two feet and six inches.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: This refers to the measurement of the head bone. The average person indicates those in the world who are seven feet and five inches tall, considered to be of moderate stature in ancient times. A person of moderate stature will also have a head bone that is of moderate size. With the head bone being moderate, the bones of the entire body will be of moderate size as well.)

<p>This section summarizes the measurements of bones to define the lengths of the meridians. The prominent and firm ones are rich in blood, while the fine and deep ones rich in qi. This treatise discusses the relationship between bones and qi in forming the blood and qi of the meridians; blood vessels begin at the kidneys. When the essence of the bones is robust, the blood and qi in the meridians will also be abundant.</p>
<p>Chapter on Resolving Qi</p>
<p>Grains enter and fill with qi; marshes seep into the bones. Bones are related to flexing and releasing moisture, nourishing the brain and marrow, and providing moisture to the skin, which is termed liquid. When the liquid is depleted, the bones cannot flex and release effectively, resulting in pale skin, brain and marrow depletion, leg pain, and frequent ear ringing.</p>
<p>When the liquid is depleted, the bones cannot flex and release properly, failing to nourish the skin, leading to pale hair and skin discoloration. The kidneys govern the bones, and since the marrow connects to the brain, when the brain and marrow are depleted, it causes leg pain and ear ringing.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p>Huangdi said: What signs indicate a person&#39;s susceptibility to cold and heat? Shaoyu answered: Those with small bones and weak flesh are prone to cold and heat. Huangdi asked: How can one determine the size of the bones, the firmness of the flesh, and the variations in color? Shaoyu replied: The cheekbone is the foundation of the bones. If the cheekbone is large, then the bones are large; if the cheekbone is small, then the bones are small. If the skin is thin and its flesh is lacking, the arms are feeble and the complexion is shadowy, not matching the color of the heavens but instead appearing dirty and distinct—these are the signs. A person with thin arms has insufficient marrow, making them susceptible to cold and heat. </p>
<p>The kidneys govern the bones; thus, the cheekbones serve as an external indication of the kidneys. Therefore, if the cheekbones are large, then the bones of the entire body are large; if they are small, the bones are known to be small. Thin arms signify a lack of substantial flesh in the thighs and upper arms. The complexion reflects a deficiency that does not match the heavens, indicating a low and dirty constitution. Marrow fills the bones, so if the bones are small, the marrow will not be sufficient. The skin represents Yang externally, while tendons and bones represent Yin. When bones are small and skin is thin, both Yin and Yang are deficient. A deficiency in Yang leads to the manifestation of cold, while a deficiency in Yin causes heat; hence, individuals with small bones and thin skin are prone to cold and heat.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Organs</strong></p>
<p>The meridians are the pathways for blood and qi to circulate, nourishing yin and yang, moistening the tendons and bones, and benefiting the joints. Therefore, when the blood is harmonious, the meridians flow smoothly, nurturing yin and yang, resulting in strong tendons and bones and clear, functional joints.</p>
<p><strong>On Pain</strong></p>
<p>Those with strong bones and weak tendons, soft flesh and thick skin endure pain better, whether from needles or stones, or from fire and heat. Moreover, those with dark and beautiful bones can withstand heat. Those with firm flesh and thin skin cannot endure the pain of needles or stones, and the same goes for heat. </p>
<p>(Note: The skin, flesh, tendons, and bones of a person are all nourished by the yin and yang energies. The lesser yin holds the essence of pre-natal qi, while the greater yang transforms the essence from food and drink, hence the strength or weakness of the tendons and bones, the firmness or tenderness of the flesh, and the thickness or thinness of the skin, all depend on the qi derived from the lesser yin and greater yang. Those with dark and beautiful bones show abundant blood and qi from the lesser yin. Those with soft flesh and thick skin exhibit rich blood and qi from the greater yang. Conversely, those with firm flesh and thin skin manifest weak qi from the greater yang, thus unable to bear the pain from needles, stones, or heat.)</p>

<p>(Note: Externally, the skin represents yang, while the tendons and bones represent yin. When the affliction occurs in yang, it is called wind; when in yin, it is called numbness. The nails are a residual of the tendons, and with insufficient blood and qi, they cannot nourish the tendons and bones, leading to the retention of cold and damp evils, resulting in bone pain and withered nails.)<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

<h4>Bone Atrophy</h4>
<p>One damage affects the skin and hair; the skin gathers and hair falls out. Two damage affects the blood vessels; the blood becomes deficient and cannot nourish the organs. Three damage affects the muscles; the muscles emaciate, and food cannot nourish the skin. Four damage affects the tendons; the tendons become slack and cannot hold together. Five damage affects the bones; bone atrophy prevents getting out of bed. Those who experience the opposite will recover from illness. If the damage originates from above, bone atrophy preventing getting out of bed leads to death. If it originates from below, skin gathers and hair falls out leads to death. The accumulation of the kidneys is called phlegm rising, starting in the lower abdomen and rising to the heart in a shape resembling a toad, sometimes rising or falling at all times. If it persists for long, it causes wheezing, bone atrophy, and shortness of breath, which can be acquired during the summer on a Bing or Ding day.</p>
<h4>Joint Pain</h4>
<p>If you obtain the pulse of the spleen, the external symptoms are a yellow face, good belching, good thinking, and good tasting. The internal symptom is a moving qi in the abdomen, pressing it is firm and painful. This illness causes abdominal distension, inability to digest food, a heavy body with joint pain, laziness and a desire to lie down, and limbs not responding. If these symptoms are present, it is related to the spleen; if not, it is not.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Joint Pain</strong></p>
<p>The patient speaks in a soft voice, with surprise or joy indicating illness between the joints. If there is joint pain with irritation, a pulse that is deep and thin indicates dampness obstruction. Symptoms of dampness obstruction include difficulty with urination and accelerated bowel movements; therefore, one should promote urination. When wind and dampness interact, joint pain worsens, with sharp pain making it difficult to bend or stretch; approaching the painful area exacerbates the pain, there is sweating and shortness of breath, difficulty urinating, aversion to wind with a desire to keep warm, or slight body swelling—this is treated with Glycyrrhiza and Aconite Decoction. </p>
<p>In cases of warm malaria, the pulse feels even, the body lacks chill but feels hot, and the joints are painful, with occasional vomiting; the treatment is White Tiger Decoction with Cinnamon Twig. </p>
<p>A deep and weak pulse at the wrist indicates the bones, while weakness pertains to the tendons; deep suggests the kidneys, while weakness pertains to the liver. Sweating and entering water can injure the heart. Yellow sweat appearing from the joints is hence called joint sweat. </p>
<p>The Shaoyin pulse is floating and weak; weakness indicates insufficient blood, and floating indicates wind; wind and blood interacting causes pain like being pulled. </p>
<p>For a strong person with a pulse that is thick and small, experiencing shortness of breath and spontaneous sweating, joint pain that cannot be bent or stretched, these are all caused by alcohol consumption and sweating in the wind. </p>
<p>If all limbs ache, and the body is thin and frail, with swollen feet, dizziness, shortness of breath, mild nausea, it is treated with Cinnamon Twig, Peony, and Anemarrhena Decoction. </p>
<p>Sour tastes harm the tendons; tendon injury leads to slackness, termed &#39;leakage.&#39; Salty tastes harm the bones; bone injury leads to atrophy, termed &#39;dryness.&#39;<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

<p>When Yin evil enters the kidneys, it causes bone pain and lower back pain, pulling upwards to cause pain in the spine.</p>
<p><strong>Obstruction</strong></p>
<p>Bone obstruction arises from excessive desires and imbalances, damaging the kidneys. When energy within depletes, it cannot regulate restrictions; when it cannot regulate, both the middle and upper parts become chaotic. When the middle and upper are chaotic, the energy of the three burners becomes stagnant and unresponsive. When the three burners are stagnant, intake of food and drink is not refined; when food and drink are not refined, the essence and energy decline daily. As essence and energy decline, evil energies improperly enter; when evil energies improperly enter, they surge upwards towards the heart and tongue, leading to mutism. If the spleen and stomach are affected, there will be deficiency; if the flow is obstructed in the lower back and knees, there will be lack of mobility; if the limbs are attacked, there will be numbness. If cold is present in the center, the pulse will be slow; if heat is present, the pulse will be rapid; if wind is present, the pulse will be superficial; if dampness is present, the pulse will be moist; if deficiency is present, the pulse will be slippery. The symptoms are not uniform and require detailed understanding.

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The extreme condition of the bones is governed by the kidneys. The kidneys correspond with the bones, and the bones are aligned with the kidneys. Furthermore, it is said that encountering illness in winter leads to bone pathology. If bone pathology persists and one is further affected by external邪 (pathogenic factors), it resides within the kidneys. Symptoms include tinnitus and seeing dark colors, which are indicators of this condition. If the kidneys are ill, the bones reach an extreme state, leading to painful teeth, aching hands and feet, an inability to stand for long, difficulties in bending and stretching, body numbness, and sourness in the brain marrow. Seasonal factors such as the winter&#39;s yin water (Ren and Gui) can harm the kidneys, causing wind to disrupt the bones, hence the term &quot;extreme bones.&quot; </p>
<p>If there is deficiency in the qi-yin, the yin becomes deficient, which leads to cold; cold results in a swollen face and darkened features, pain in the lower back and spine, weakness in prolonged standing, and difficulties in bending and stretching. If the qi declines, hair falls out and teeth become brittle, with back pain that increases and causes severe coughing and spitting. If there is excess in the qi-yang, the yang becomes full, resulting in heat; heat manifests as a flushed face, blockage in the bladder, painful teeth and brain marrow, with aching hands and feet, tinnitus, and dark coloration, indicating extreme bone issues. </p>
<p>One must discern between yin and yang, examine the clarity and turbidity of the condition, understand its division, and observe the respiratory patterns. A skilled healer begins treatment at the skin and tendons, and must address these first. If they delve into the organs, it may be too late. As Bian Que stated: &quot;Incurable bone conditions lead to severe pain, immobility in flexion and extension, and death within ten days.&quot; The bones correspond to the lesser yin of the feet; if lesser yin qi is exhausted, the bones become dry and devoid of vitality, leading to the premature death of bones. </p>
<p>Regarding bone deficiency and excess:</p>
<p>If the bones are deficient, they are sore, aching, unstable, and fatigued; if they are excess, they are troubled, hot, and uncomfortable. All responses of bone deficiency and excess are governed by the kidneys and bladder. If there are illnesses in the organs, heat may arise from the bones affecting them, or cold may impact the organs.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Void and Fullness of Marrow</strong></p>
<p>Those with a deficiency of marrow experience headache and restlessness; those with full marrow are brave and fierce. The conditions of marrow’s void and fullness relate to the liver and gallbladder. If there are diseases in the organs stemming from the marrow, heat corresponds to the organs, while cold corresponds to the bowels.<br>— <em>The Ten Books of Dongyuan</em> by Li Gao (Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Distinction between Internal and External Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Internal injuries represent illnesses where the qi of the heart and lungs has been exhausted externally, resulting in lethargy and a desire to lie down, with the limbs feeling heavy and unresponsive. This is due to heat damaging the original qi; the spleen governs the limbs, and when overcome by heat, there is no energy to move. The classics say: &quot;Heat injures qi&quot;; and again state: &quot;Heat leads to bone devaluation and relaxed tendons,&quot; referring to this phenomenon. Conversely, external injuries from wind and cold indicate that the qi of the kidneys and liver has been exhausted internally; the kidneys govern bones and are associated with cold, while the liver governs tendons and is associated with wind. Historically, kidney and liver diseases are treated similarly, as they mutually support each other. Hence, the classics say that the gallbladder governs tendons, and the bladder governs bones. Whether it is a stroke or a cold injury, on the day a disease manifests, one immediately goes to bed and cannot rise; it is not that they cannot get up, but rather their tendons and bones are in pain, preventing movement, indicating a physical injury. The classics state: &quot;Cold injures the form&quot;; and also say: &quot;Cold causes tendons to cramp and bones to hurt,&quot; referring to this. </p>
<p><strong>On Bone Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>The heat from kidney qi gives rise to bone atrophy, hence, the feet cannot support the body. All forms of atrophy relate to the upper parts of the body, indicating that the root of the illness lies in the lungs. Therefore, it must first arise in the lungs, and then heat spreads to the five organs, manifesting as various forms of atrophy.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Diagnosis of Bone Disease</strong>  </p>
<p>Pain in the bones from the chest, ribs, hips, knees, extending to the outer ankles, pertains to the lesser yang gallbladder meridian. When there is pain in the knees, swelling in the joints, it relates to the greater yin liver meridian.  </p>
<p><strong>Joint Pain</strong>  </p>
<p>When heat is trapped below and the kidneys are weak, the legs and knees become thin and frail, the joints ache, and the essence is deplete, leading to watery salvation; thirst is less, and the marrow sinks leading to frequent and turbid urination, which is a condition termed &quot;kidney consumption.&quot; If there is joint pain, Qianghuo should be used to dispel wind and dampness. If an obese person experiences joint pain, it is often due to wind-dampness and phlegm accumulating in the meridians, so Nanzheng and Banxia should be used. If a thin person has joint pain, it indicates blood deficiency; thus, Siwu Decoction should be modified with Fangfeng and Qianghuo. If a thin person is impatient and the joints feel warm, it indicates blood heat; thus, Siwu Decoction should be modified with Huangqin and wine-fried Huangbai. For swollen and painful joints with a slippery pulse, it is likely dampness and dryness, and one should use Cangzhu and Nanzheng, alongside qi-moving herbs like Muxiang, Zhike, and Binglang. For those with swelling and pain in joints and a rough, rapid pulse, it indicates blood stasis; therefore, use Taoren, Honghua, Danggui, Chuanxiong, and a small amount of Dahuang for a mild purgative effect. If there is fatigue and weakness accompanied by joint pain, it suggests qi deficiency and phlegm stagnation; thus, use Renshen, Baizhu, Xingren, and Banxia.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>The Cavities of Bones</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: The marrow cavities are located three parts behind the brain, beneath the sharp bones at the top of the skull. Wang&#39;s commentary indicates this is called the Wind Palace, which connects to the brain. One cavity is under the base of the jaw; Wang comments that it is located in the concave part beneath the bone, containing a small aperture. Another is in the back of the neck, beneath the bones; Wang notes this is the &quot;Mute Gate&quot; point. There is an empty cavity above the spinal bones, located above the Wind Palace; Wang describes this as the &quot;Brain Door&quot; point. The cavity beneath the spinal bones lies below the coccyx. Lin Yi notes that the &quot;Changqiang&quot; point is at the end of the sacrum, precisely under the coccyx. The multiple cavities of the marrow are found in the area surrounding the nose; Wang mentions this corresponds to points such as the &quot;Zygomatic&quot; points. Additionally, there is a bone cavity beneath the mouth, near the shoulders; Wang identifies this as the &quot;Great Welcoming&quot; point. The two hip bone cavities lie in the yang region of the hips; Wang notes this is near the &quot;Shoulder Yǔ&quot; point. The arm bone cavity is located on the yang side of the arms, four inches from the ankle, between two bones; Wang clarifies this is at the &quot;Confluence&quot; point, one inch from the measurement of the body. The cavity above the thigh bones is found on the yang side of the thighs, four inches above the knee; Wang notes this is beneath the &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; point above the &quot;Yin Market.&quot; The cavity of the &quot;Shan&quot; bone is at the top of the &quot;Assist Bone&quot;; Wang refers to this as the &quot;Calf Nose.&quot; The cavity within the thigh region is located within the hair, below the movement area.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

There are connections within the bones, and it is those connections that allow the bones to benefit and nourish the brain&#39;s marrow. The Yellow Emperor asked, &#39;How can this be addressed?&#39; Bo Gao said, &#39;With the myriad changes in diseases, floating and sinking, shallow and deep, one cannot fully exhaust their understanding; each is in its own place. Those with shallow ailments need less attention, while the more severe require greater attention. Adjust the qi according to the changes; hence, it is said that this is the art of the master. The eight winds can harm people and reside within the bones, resolving the waist, spine, joints, and pores, resulting in deep numbness. Therefore, to treat it with needles, one must lengthen their reach and sharpen their tips to extract the deep evil and alleviate the numbness. In cases of heat disease where the pain is unclear, with deafness that cannot be subsided, a dry mouth, and intense yang heat while the yin possesses chill, the heat resides within the marrow; such cases are beyond treatment. The &#39;Nanjing&#39; states: Where the bones gather at Da Zhu, this is where bone disease should be treated with moxibustion. The &#39;Baoming Ji&#39; states: When all joints ache and the symptoms are unclear, the triangular needle can pierce to the bone and induce bleeding. The &#39;Yixue Gangmu&#39; states: When the tendons are cramped and there is bone pain, one should nourish the Soul Gate. The &#39;Gujin Yitong&#39; states: If the bones are cold and the marrow cold as fire comes to burn, there are miraculous points that must be clearly recorded. The &#39;Suwen&#39; states: If the disease resides in the tendons, one should needle the tendons without injuring the bones; if the bones are injured, it will affect the kidneys.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Treasured Handbook of Health&quot; states: Zhang Dazhan, aged twenty-nine from Zhen Ding Prefecture, had a long-standing fondness for alcohol. In May of the year 1291, he fell ill with swollen and painful finger joints, and difficulty in bending and stretching; his knees also exhibited similar symptoms. He experienced distension below the heart, a heavy body, a lack of desire for food and drink, and when he did eat, he felt the urge to vomit. His complexion was sallow, and his spirit was diminished. By June, he came to seek my treatment. Upon examining his pulse, it was deep and slow, which indicates a problem with the spleen. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states that when the body is heavy and the joints are painful, it is under the spleen&#39;s dominion, as the spleen governs the limbs. His long-term drinking, coupled with the humidity of the season, had caused excessive moisture to flow into the limbs, resulting in swelling and pain. The &quot;Neijing&quot; says that all damp swelling and pain are associated with the spleen&#39;s earth element. Zhongjing mentions that dampness flowing into the joints causes pain and discomfort in the limbs; this aligns with his condition. Therefore, it is advisable to use the Daqianghuo Decoction to treat him. The &quot;Neijing&quot; further states that internal dampness should be treated with a bitter and warm approach, using bitterness to release it and mildness to drain it. It also mentions that wind can overcome dampness. Qianghuo and Duhuo are bitter and warm, penetrating the joints to eliminate dampness, thus they are the primary ingredients. Shengma is bitter and neutral, while Weilingxian, Fangfeng, and Cangzhu are bitter, spicy, and warm, acting to promote this effect, thus they serve as the secondary ingredients. If blood is stagnated and not flowing, we seek to use Chuanxiong which is spicy and warm to disperse it. Licorice assists in energizing and harmonizing, while Zexie is salty and neutral, and Fuling is sweet and neutral; together they guide the dampness and benefit urination, facilitating drainage through mildness. The combination of flavors harmonizes to disperse dampness both upward and downward.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

<p>Tao Tianjue&#39;s concubines were numerous and often suffered from headaches, with excessive phlegm.

One water cannot overcome two fires. The kidneys represent water, which manifests in the bones; if the kidneys do not produce, the marrow cannot be replenished, resulting in cold even to the bones.

When the water is cold and dominates, the vital energy of the sun weakens, and the solitary yin does not flourish. The essence of water is indeed water. When the essence of the kidneys is exhausted and does not flourish, the water of the bladder cannot overcome the two fires. The kidneys give rise to the marrow, and the marrow nourishes the liver. If the kidney's fat does not produce, then the marrow cannot fill the bones, which is why cold reaches the bones. The liver represents the wood fire of the initial rise of yang. The heart represents the fire of the earthly sovereignty. The kidney is the female organ, the solitary organ. The yin of the solitary organ relies on the solar model for transformation; when the solar energy weakens, the solitary yin does not thrive. The fluids of the bladder cannot overcome the two fires; hence, a person cannot endure the cold if the two yang fires are heated internally. This ailment is called bone bi (pain); the illness arises from marrow depletion and bone pain, leading to stiffened joints. The Treatise on Bi When the three energies of wind, cold, and dampness arrive together, they form bi. Encountering this in winter leads to bone bi. If bone bi persists and is further afflicted by evil, it lodges within the kidneys. Kidney bi causes bloating, where the buttocks replace the heels and the spine replaces the head. (Note: The skin, flesh, tendons, and bones are internally associated with the five organs, and the energy of the five organs is externally associated with the four seasons. Initially, the illness is manifest in an external and tangible form, but it subsequently damages the internal energies of the five organs. The interaction between the external manifestations and internal energies allows evil to reside within. The kidneys are the gateway of the stomach; if the gate is obstructed, the stomach energy cannot circulate, leading to bloating.

If there are diseases in the organs stemming from the marrow, heat corresponds to the organs, while cold corresponds to the bowels. — *The Ten Books of Dongyuan* by Li Gao (Yuan Dynasty) **Distinction between Internal and External Injuries** Internal injuries represent illnesses where the qi of the heart and lungs has been exhausted externally, resulting in lethargy and a desire to lie down, with the limbs feeling heavy and unresponsive. This is due to heat damaging the original qi; the spleen governs the limbs, and when overcome by heat, there is no energy to move. The classics say: \"Heat injures qi\"; and again state: \"Heat leads to bone devaluation and relaxed tendons,\" referring to this phenomenon. Conversely, external injuries from wind and cold indicate that the qi of the kidneys and liver has been exhausted internally; the kidneys govern bones and are associated with cold, while the liver governs tendons and is associated with wind. Historically, kidney and liver diseases are treated similarly, as they mutually support each other. Hence, the classics say that the gallbladder governs tendons, and the bladder governs bones. Whether it is a stroke or a cold injury, on the day a disease manifests, one immediately goes to bed and cannot rise; it is not that they cannot get up, but rather their tendons and bones are in pain, preventing movement, indicating a physical injury. The classics state: \"Cold injures the form\"; and also say: \"Cold causes tendons to cramp and bones to hurt,\" referring to this. **On Bone Atrophy** The heat from kidney qi gives rise to bone atrophy, hence, the feet cannot support the body. All forms of atrophy relate to the upper parts of the body, indicating that the root of the illness lies in the lungs. Therefore, it must first arise in the lungs, and then heat spreads to the five organs, manifesting as various forms of atrophy."},{"anchor":"trans-29p","marker":"29p","type":"translation","text":"**Danxi Heart Method** **Author: Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty)** **Diagnosis of Bone Disease** Pain in the bones from the chest, ribs, hips, knees, extending to the outer ankles, pertains to the lesser yang gallbladder meridian. When there is pain in the knees, swelling in the joints, it relates to the greater yin liver meridian. **Joint Pain** When heat is trapped below and the kidneys are weak, the legs and knees become thin and frail, the joints ache, and the essence is deplete, leading to watery salvation; thirst is less, and the marrow sinks leading to frequent and turbid urination, which is a condition termed \"kidney consumption.\" If there is joint pain, Qianghuo should be used to dispel wind and dampness. If an obese person experiences joint pain, it is often due to wind-dampness and phlegm accumulating in the meridians, so Nanzheng and Banxia should be used. If a thin person has joint pain, it indicates blood deficiency; thus, Siwu Decoction should be modified with Fangfeng and Qianghuo. If a thin person is impatient and the joints feel warm, it indicates blood heat; thus, Siwu Decoction should be modified with Huangqin and wine-fried Huangbai. For swollen and painful joints with a slippery pulse, it is likely dampness and dryness, and one should use Cangzhu and Nanzheng, alongside qi-moving herbs like Muxiang, Zhike, and Binglang. For those with swelling and pain in joints and a rough, rapid pulse, it indicates blood stasis; therefore, use Taoren, Honghua, Danggui, Chuanxiong, and a small amount of Dahuang for a mild purgative effect.
