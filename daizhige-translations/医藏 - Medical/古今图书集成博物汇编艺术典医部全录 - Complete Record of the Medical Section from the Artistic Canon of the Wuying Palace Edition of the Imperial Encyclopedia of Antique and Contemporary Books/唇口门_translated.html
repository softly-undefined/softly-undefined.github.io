      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <div><p><strong>Comprehensive Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Medical Section, Volume 153</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lips and Mouth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi’s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatise on the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>The center is yellow, connected to the spleen, opening at the mouth, and storing essence in the spleen.  [Note: The center is the position of earth, the spleen is the earth organ, and its qi is interconnected. Yellow is the color of earth, and the mouth is the orifice of the spleen.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The center generates dampness, dampness produces earth, earth generates sweetness, sweetness nourishes the spleen, the spleen generates flesh, flesh generates the lungs, and the spleen connects to the mouth, which is the orifice.  [Note: The qi of the spleen is connected to the mouth, and when the spleen is harmonious, it can discern the flavors of grains, hence the spleen governs the mouth. The spleen serves to welcome nourishment, which is why its orifice is at the mouth.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Six Energetic Organs</strong></p>
<p>The spleen, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, three burners, and bladder are the foundation of the granary and the residence of nourishment, referred to as vessels. Their manifestation can be seen in the white flesh of the four corners of the lips.  [Note: The spleen receives food and water as a transport official, the intestines receive and transmit food and water, the three burners regulate the water pathways, the bladder is the organ of water essence, thus they are the foundation of the granary. The spleen houses nourishment, thus it is called the residence of nourishment. The spleen possesses the qi of raising, lowering, entering, and exiting, hence it is termed a vessel. The four whites refer to the white flesh at the four edges of the lips. The mouth is the orifice of the spleen and governs the flesh, hence the manifestation is found in the white flesh of the lips.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The Yangming channel indicates the end, with movements of the mouth and eyes, leading to excessive surprise and vain talk, and a yellow complexion. If there is a lack of benevolence above and below, it is the end.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Heat</h3>
<p>In five days, the Shaoyin suffers. The Shaoyin pulse connects to the kidney, branches to the lung, and is linked at the base of the tongue, causing dryness in the mouth and tongue and thirst. On the eleventh day, the Shaoyin disease weakens, thirst ceases, there is no fullness, and the tongue is dry followed by sneezing. </p>
<p>The six energies interact; though they enter into the yin within, they all manifest as heat symptoms, hence the dryness and thirst. As the pathogenic qi gradually weakens, the righteous qi begins to recover, thus thirst ceases. Those affected by cold on both sides suffer; if it lasts one day, both the Juyin and Shaoyin are affected, resulting in headaches, dry mouth, and fullness.</p>
<p>This also discusses the dual effects of yin and yang in disease. The Taiyang and Shaoyin interact as exterior and interior; if both are afflicted simultaneously, it results in Taiyang headaches and Shaoyin&#39;s fullness and dry mouth.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Qi Blocking</h3>
<p>Heat from the bladder moves to the small intestine, causing hindered bowel movements, resulting in oral ulcers. </p>
<p>The pulse of the small intestine connects to the heart, following the throat down to the bladder, as it pertains to the small intestine. The lower part of the small intestine is called the “gate of the ileum,” which separates and filters fluids, seeping into the bladder. Heat transferred back from the bladder to the small intestine causes the intestines to fail to descend. The damp heat qi adversely reverses along the channel, leading to ulceration of the mouth.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Wind</h3>
<p>The injuries caused by wind, particularly in summer, lead to what is called &quot;heart wind.&quot; The symptoms of heart wind include excessive sweating, aversion to wind, dryness and burning sensations, propensity for anger and fright, and a red complexion. In severe cases, speech becomes difficult. Diagnosis reveals a red color in the mouth. <strong>[Note: The heart is associated with the fire organ; when wind is excessive, fire becomes intense, resulting in dry and cracked lips with a deficiency of moisture. Wind transforms wood, and the conflict of wood and fire leads to easy anger and fear. The heart governs the tongue; if the condition worsens, the tongue becomes strong but speech becomes difficult. When the heart is harmonious, the tongue can discern the five flavors, hence the diagnosis involves the mouth.]</strong></p>
<p>When wind enters the interior for a long time, it causes intestinal wind leading to diarrhea. If it affects the skin&#39;s surface, it results in &quot;leakage wind.&quot; The symptoms of leakage wind include heavy sweating, with sweat soaking through clothing, and dryness in the mouth. When the wind pools above, it impedes effort, and if the body is in pain, it is accompanied by coldness. <strong>[Note: The qi of the spleen and stomach governs the muscles externally and the abdomen internally. If the wind pathogen remains in the muscles and enters the interior, it injures the qi of the spleen and stomach, resulting in intestinal wind and diarrhea. The large and small intestines both belong to the stomach. If it remains long in the exterior muscles, the yang qi disperses outward, leading to leakage wind. Leakage wind occurs when the skin opens and the qi is harmed, which causes excessive sweating. Sweat leaking onto clothing gradually soaks through, signifying that the source is not closed. The loss of fluids leads to dryness in the mouth. When the wind accumulates above, affecting the upper body, the interplay of wind and dampness harms the yang qi, leading to inability to exert oneself. If one tends to labor excessively, the body will be in pain and feel cold.]</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>When the liver qi is hot, it leads to bile leakage, a bitter mouth, and dryness in the sinews and membranes. When the sinews and membranes are dry, the muscles become tense and spasm, resulting in muscular atrophy. [Note: The gallbladder is an organ that stores essence and corresponds to the sinews. The sinews throughout the body are nourished by the essence contained in the gallbladder. When the gallbladder is attached to the liver, if the liver qi is hot, bile leaks out causing a bitter mouth; when bile leaks, the sinews and membranes lack nourishment and become dry, leading to tension and spasm that result in atrophy.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Syncope</strong></p>
<p>When there is syncope in the lesser yin, it results in dry mouth, red urine, abdominal distension, and heart pain. [Note: The foot lesser yin pulse belongs to the kidneys, connects with the bladder, passes through the liver diaphragm, enters the lungs, exits to connect with the heart, travels through the throat, and underlies the root of the tongue. When the meridians are reversed, the yin fluids cannot ascend, hence the dry mouth and heart pain. The lung metal cannot regulate the lower part, leading to red urine. When the energies of water and fire, yin and yang do not interact, it results in abdominal distension.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Rare Diseases</strong><a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>The Emperor said: What is the name of the disease that causes a sweet taste in the mouth? How does one acquire it? Qi Bo replied: This is the overflow of the five qi, called spleen dampness. The five flavors enter through the mouth, stored in the stomach, and the spleen regulates their essence and energy. The fluid in the spleen causes the mouth to taste sweet. This is produced by rich and fatty foods. Such a person must often consume sweet and rich food, which leads to internal heat, and the sweetness causes fullness, resulting in an overflow of qi that transforms into thirst. Treat it with orchids to eliminate the accumulated old qi.</p>
<p>[Note: The five qi refers to earth qi, which is central; in number it is five, in flavor it is sweet, in odor it is fragrant, in organ it is the spleen, and in orifice it is the mouth. Eating too much sweet and rich food leaves foul odors in the spleen, causing the spleen qi to overflow and manifest externally. Rich flavors generate internal heat, and sweetness tends to linger. The spleen is responsible for transporting fluid from the stomach. When the five flavors are consumed, the fluids each follow their path; sweetness reaches the spleen first, and consuming rich sweet food often leads to internal heat retention. Fluids cannot be distributed among the five organs and remain isolated in the spleen. When spleen qi overflows, it causes the mouth to taste sweet. Treat it with orchids to eliminate the accumulated old qi.]</p>
<p>The Great Treatise on Qi Transformation</p>
<p>In a year of inadequate metal, the fire of inflammation predominates, causing people to suffer from mouth sores, and in severe cases, heart pain. </p>
<p>[Note: In the year of the sixth yi, when metal energy fails, the conquering fire energy prevails. With weak metal and excessive fire, water then restores balance. The cold water qi ascends, pressing on the heart&#39;s fire, leading to mouth sores and severe heart pain among the people.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>The Great Discussion on the Five Constants and Governance</strong></p>
<p>The chronicle of preparation for transformation is centered around the mouth.<br>(Note: Preparation for transformation refers to the earth&#39;s governance; earth corresponds to the spleen, and the spleen opens to the mouth.) The wind of the extreme yin descends from the heavens; the energy of the spleen rises, as the earth flourishes and yellow sprouts. When water becomes obstructed, the earth must undergo transformation, experiencing heaviness while the muscles atrophy and the appetite diminishes, leading to a dry mouth.<br>(Note: The chronicle of earth concerns matters related to earth itself, its organ is the spleen, and its color is yellow. The flourishing earth indicates that the earth&#39;s essence is abundant below. The yellow sprouting refers to the earth’s energy rising to the heavens. Since earth transforms under the influence of wood, it is subjected to its overcoming power, resulting in the earth changing and causing spleen ailments characterized by heaviness and decreased appetite.)</p>
<p><strong>The Essential Discussion on Ultimate Truth</strong></p>
<p>The return of the lesser yang indicates that great heat is approaching; the fire energy surges within, causing lesions in the mouth.<br>(Note: This so-called fire refers to the fire of the lesser yin. When fire energy rises within the upper burner, it results in lesions in the mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>The Classic of the Spiritual Axis</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chapter on the Forms of Disease in the Organs Caused by Pathogenic Factors</strong></p>
<p>Those with gallbladder ailments tend to sigh heavily; they have a bitter taste in the mouth, vomit undigested bile, experience a faint sensation in the heart area, and fear being captured, with a &quot;heaving&quot; sensation in the throat leading to frequent spitting.<br>(Note: For those with gallbladder ailments, the gallbladder energy does not rise, hence they sigh to release it. The bitter taste and vomited bile indicate the presence of bile. The faint sensation in the heart area means the gallbladder energy is deficient. The heaving in the throat and frequent spitting indicate a disease in the lesser yang channel.)<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>The main channel of the Large Intestine (Hand Yangming) exits at the corner of the mouth and intersects at the Ren Zhong point. It governs diseases arising from bodily fluids, which include yellowing of the eyes, dryness of the mouth, nasal bleeding, throat obstruction, and pain in the shoulder and upper arm. </p>
<p>(Note: The Large Intestine transmits food and water, transforming it into refined essence. Hence, it governs bodily fluids; when there is a deficiency of fluids and an excess of heat, symptoms such as yellowing of the eyes and dryness of the mouth occur.)</p>
<p>The main channel of the Stomach (Foot Yangming) exits at the corner of the mouth, encircles the lips, and connects to the Cheng Jiang point. It governs diseases arising from blood, which include mania, intermittent fevers, excessive sweating, nasal bleeding, crooked mouth, and swollen lips. </p>
<p>(Note: The Stomach is the sea of food and drink and governs the generation of nutritive blood. Therefore, it governs blood-related diseases, leading to conditions like mania and intermittent fever with sweating due to the heat of stomach qi evaporating fluids. Nasal bleeding is due to the heat in the meridians. Crooked mouth and swollen lips indicate diseases of the Yangming channel.)</p>
<p>If the Qi of the Foot Taiyin is exhausted, the pulse will not nourish the muscles. The shoulder and tongue are foundational to the muscles. If the pulse does not nourish, the muscles will be weak; if the muscles are weak, they will atrophy, leading to fullness in the Ren Zhong point. If the Ren Zhong point is full, the lips will invert; if the lips invert, it means the flesh has begun to perish. If the first of the wood element (Yin) is strong and the second of the earth element (Yang) is weak, wood prevails over earth.</p>
<p>(Note: The Qi of the Foot Taiyin originates in the Spleen. The Spleen stores the nourishing essence and externally governs muscle. Thus, if the Taiyin Qi is exhausted, the pulse will not nourish the muscles. The Spleen opens to the mouth and governs the reception of food, making the lips and tongue fundamental to muscle. If the pulse does not nourish, the tongue will wither and the lips will invert, indicating that the vital substance of Taiyin has exhausted externally. If the first of wood is strong and the second of earth is weak, then the Qi of the Spleen dies internally.)<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>Chapter on the Meridians of Water</strong></p>
<p>The Yangming of the Foot is straight, following the throat and emerging from the mouth, reaching the forehead and skull.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on the Tendons</strong></p>
<p>The tendon of the Foot Yangming is positioned above the mouth; its sickness affects the mouth. When the Yangming of the Foot and the Taiyang of the Hand are tense, both the mouth and eyes are affected. [Note: The tendon of the Foot Yangming above the mouth corresponds to the area beneath the eyes. The tendon of the Hand Taiyang is connected to the lower jaw and outer canthus. Thus, if the left tendon is tense, it affects the left side, and one should puncture the left; if the right tendon is tense, it affects the right side, and one should puncture the right.]</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Cold and Heat Diseases</strong></p>
<p>When the muscles are cold or hot, they ache, hair becomes scorched, and the lips become dry and waxy. [Note: The blood and qi outside the pulse fill the skin and hot flesh, leading to hair growth. Therefore, when the disease affects the muscles, they ache, and hair becomes scorched. The spleen governs the muscles, opening at the mouth, hence the lips become dry and waxy.]</p>
<p><strong>Chapter on Transmission from Teachers</strong></p>
<p>The spleen governs the defenses, directing them to confront food, observing the condition of the lips and tongue to discern auspiciousness or inauspiciousness. [Note: The spleen is the official of transport and circulation, hence governs defenses. Auspiciousness and inauspiciousness depend on the health of the organs—when they are well, it is auspicious; when they are ill, it is inauspicious.] Those with thick lips and a long philtrum indicate the condition of the small intestine. [Note: The mouth is the orifice of the spleen; the small intestine receives the turbid matter from the spleen and stomach and connects to the stomach, thus the lips and philtrum indicate the condition of the small intestine.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Excess and Deficiency in Body Types</strong></p>
<p>In the case of the robust and strong, with ample blood and vitality, firm skin, if they are subjected to malefic influences, the needles penetrate deeply and leave a lasting mark, this is a plump person. They have broad shoulders and thick skin that is dark, with thin flesh around the neck. Their lips are slightly protruding, their blood is dark and turbid, their energy is sluggish and delayed, and in character, they are greedy for gain and contributions. When needles penetrate deeply and remain, it increases their quantity. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: This describes the excess of physical form. Broad shoulders indicate a wide expansion to all sides. The neck represents the domain of the sun; thin flesh and thick, dark skin show the prominence of the sun’s water energy. The lips are an outer indication of the spleen’s earth elements, slightly protruding show the richness of earth energy. The dark coloration represents water’s essence; turbid blood signifies heavy and cloudy vital essence. Sluggish energy indicates thick flesh and obstructed energy pathways. Those who have excess can share, while those who have deficiency are greedy. Both greedy for gain, they fail to achieve the way of balance.</strong> </p>
<p>In contrast, lean individuals have thin skin and lack of color, their flesh is light and delicate, their lips are thin and their speech is light. Their blood is clear, their energy is clean, they easily lose vitality, and their blood is vulnerable. Needles should penetrate shallowly and quickly for them.</p>
<p><strong>[Note: This discusses the deficiency in physical form. Thin skin and lack of color signify insufficient atmospheric energy. Light and delicate appearance reflects deficiency in earthly energy. Clear blood indicates lightness and shallow water. Clear energy shows thin muscles and smooth energy pathways.]</strong><a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p>
<h3>The Chapter on the Organs</h3>
<p>Those with thin lips have a high spleen, while those with thick lips have a low spleen; strong lips indicate a strong spleen, while large but soft lips indicate a fragile spleen; well-proportioned lips indicate a proper spleen, while uneven lips suggest a tilted spleen. </p>
<h3>The Chapter on Abnormal Defensive Qi</h3>
<p>Lips that are blue, yellow, red, white, or black indicate illness in the muscles. (Note: Muscles are external to the spleen, and the earth nourishes the four organs; hence, by observing the lip colors - blue, yellow, red, white, and black - one understands that the illness of the defensive qi resides in the muscles.)</p>
<h3>The Chapter on Yin and Yang: Twenty-Five Types of People</h3>
<p>When there is a deficiency of blood and qi above the foot yangming, both lips may appear thin and drawn. (Note: A deficiency of blood and qi cannot nourish the skin, leading to a lack of fullness. Thus, the thinning of both lips is evident.)<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>The Inexpressible Worries and Angers Poem</strong></p>
<p>The lips are the fan of sound.</p>
<p><strong>The Heat Illness Poem</strong></p>
<p>In the case of heat illness lasting seven or eight days, if the pulse is weak and small, the patient shows blood in urine and dryness in the mouth. They may die in a day and a half; if the pulse is absent, death occurs in a day. </p>
<p><em>Note: Additionally, if the heat does not resolve and it transmits to the lesser yin, it becomes a sign of death. The six meridians circulate; if the illness recurs on the seventh day and does not resolve by the eighth, it is termed a relapse. A weak pulse indicates the lesser yin meridian. The superior to the lesser yin is governed by the sovereign fire. The presence of blood in urine indicates a disease of the lesser yin&#39;s water organ. Dryness in the mouth indicates an issue with the hand&#39;s lesser yin sovereign fire. A person who dies after a day and a half has succumbed within one or two days, marking the end of the interplay of yin and yang water and fire. The pulse originates in the kidney and is governed by the heart; if the pulse is absent, it signifies a cessation below, resulting in death within a day.</em></p>
<p>Heat illness may not reveal where it hurts; the patient may suffer from deafness and cannot recover, with dryness in the mouth. If yang heat is severe while yin has considerable cold, heat resides in the marrow—death is beyond remedy.</p>
<p><em>Note: If the pain of heat illness cannot be located, it indicates external heat has penetrated within. Deafness from inability to recover and dryness in the mouth indicates that kidney heat has risen. Severe yang heat combined with considerable yin cold signifies a struggle between internal heat and external factors. Heat in the marrow indicates internal struggles with external heat. All of these signify a disease that has penetrated deeply within, hence death.</em><a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>The Five Readings and Five Uses</strong></p>
<p>The mouth and lips are the organs of the spleen.<br>(Note: The spleen opens to the mouth, thus the mouth is regarded as the organ of the spleen.)</p>
<p><strong>The Stomach and Intestines</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is two and a half inches wide.</p>
<p><strong>The Mouth Inquiry</strong></p>
<p>When the Yangming qi arrives, one may bite their lips.<br>(Note: The Yangming meridian encircles the mouth and lips, and when the vital energy reverses upwards, one may bite their lips.)</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Distention</strong></p>
<p>When there is distention in the gallbladder, there is pain and distention under the ribs, bitterness in the mouth, and one tends to sigh frequently.<br>(<em>From the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; by Hua Tuo of the Han Dynasty</em>)<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p>
<h3>Diagnosis of Diseases</h3>
<p>Cold-induced fevers, when the mouth resembles a fish&#39;s mouth and cannot close, if there is excessive exhalation and no inhalation, it is fatal. If the patient&#39;s mouth is open, they will die within three days.<br><strong>(From &quot;Essentials of the Gold Coffer&quot; by Zhang Ji, Han Dynasty)</strong></p>
<h3>Dry Mouth</h3>
<p>In cases of lung wind, the mouth is dry and wheezing occurs, the body feels heavy and swollen. If the abdomen is full and the mouth and tongue are dry, there is water and gas in the intestines; use Jiāo Lì Huáng Yuán as treatment. If there is thirst for water, dry mouth and tongue, prescribe Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang. In cases of jaundice, with fever, irritability, and chest fullness, dry mouth occurs due to fire damaging the sweat during the onset of the disease, resulting in heat. However, jaundice acquired from dampness leads to full-body heating with a yellow face and fever in the abdomen, the heat is interior, and purging is necessary. If the patient experiences fullness in the chest, with parched lips and a bluish tongue, a dry mouth desiring rinse rather than swallowing, without signs of cold or heat, with a slow and weak pulse, and the abdomen is not full, the patient may complain of fullness due to stagnant blood. If the patient exhibits feverish symptoms, fullness, dry mouth and thirst, yet the pulse shows no heat, this indicates hidden yin, which is stagnant blood and should be purged.<br><strong>(From &quot;Pulse Techniques&quot; by Wang Shuhe, Jin Dynasty)</strong></p>
<h3>Diagnostic Methods</h3>
<p>Left cun pulse is rapid and forceful, indicating heart heat with a bitter mouth. Right cun pulse is floating and rapid, indicating lung heat with a spicy mouth. Left guan pulse is string-like and rapid, suggesting gallbladder deficiency with a bitter mouth; if it is strong, then liver heat with a sour mouth. Right guan pulse that is sinking and solid indicates spleen heat with a sweet mouth; if rapid, it suggests oral ulcers.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Canker Lips</strong></p>
<p>Canker lips refer to a condition that occurs on the lips, resembling a silkworm cocoon, hence the name. The Inner Canon states: &quot;The spleen&#39;s energy opens at the mouth,&quot; and it also says: &quot;The spleen&#39;s nourishment resides in the lips.&quot; However, dryness leads to cracking, heat causes splits, wind results in tremors, and cold may cause peeling. If there is swelling with a white skin that wrinkles and cracks like a cocoon, it is thus named canker lips. It often begins as a small lump, approximately the size of a bean; or it may regenerate, gradually swelling into a larger mass of about an inch thick; or it may develop into various forms like flowers, waxberries, lumps, lingzhi mushrooms, or fungi, with no fixed shape, all arising from the interaction of the six external pathogens and seven emotions. If one&#39;s anxieties and worries are excessive, heart fire can become intense, affecting the spleen channel; or consuming rich wine and heavy flavors can accumulate heat, harming the spleen, leading to the depletion of kidney water. One must carefully assess the causes of the symptoms. Only by replenishing kidney water and nourishing spleen blood will the dryness become moist, the fire diminish, the wind cease, and the swelling resolve. This is a distinct condition, seldom seen, and hard to recognize. If it does not heal after a long time, urgently use heated metal to cauterize it in moxa flames, and internally take the Gui Pi Tang to nourish and restore. This may facilitate healing. However, if one uses external methods to aggressively dissolve the toxins, it may lead to further harm; caution is important! If a woman suffers from this, it is due to a deficiency of Yin blood. It is advisable to treat it with the Si Wu Xiao Yao San.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>On Guidance</strong><br><strong>Qian Yi, Song Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Illness</strong></p>
<p>If the spleen and lungs are ill for a long time, they become deficient, leading to pale lips. The spleen is the mother of the lungs; both being deficient cannot nourish each other, hence the term &quot;timid.&quot; The lungs govern the lips; lips that are pale and lustrous indicate good health, while those that are white like withered bones indicate death. If the blood and qi are deficient and timid, and cold invades, the lips may appear blue; a dark forehead and blue lips indicate coldness.</p>

<p><strong>Six Writings from Hejian</strong><br><strong>Liu Wanshu, Jin Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bitter Mouth</strong></p>
<p>When one is indecisive and the gallbladder is deficient, causing qi to rise, the sensation of bitterness in the mouth occurs. The mouth is the residence of clarity; when disturbed by turbid qi, it overflows, which the Gallbladder-Enriching Decoction can remedy.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p>
<h3>Oral Ulcer</h3>
<p>Heat from the bladder transfers to the small intestine, causing obstruction in the diaphragm and intestines, leading to oral ulcers. When heart and stomach are obstructed by heat, food and water do not digest and move downward into the small intestine. The remedy is Chaihu-Digupi Decoction.<br><strong>Rumen&#39;s Filial Piety, by Zhang Congzheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<h3>Mouth Sores</h3>
<p>For adults and children with mouth sores and tight lips, wash away the white scabs with sour plum water, and when in distress, apply Qingpao powder. If it does not heal, apply Yuyan powder. If still not healed, use Qianbai powder for recovery.<br><strong>The Ten Books of Dongyuan, by Li Gao (Yuan Dynasty)</strong></p>
<h3>Differentiating Between Food, Drink, Labor, and Injury</h3>
<p>If injury arises from food, drink, or labor, the symptoms will be evident in the mouth: loss of taste, abdominal discomfort, unwillingness to speak; even when forced to respond, the voice will be weak. There will be excessive saliva in the mouth and clear nasal discharge, which may be intermittent; this indicates a Yin condition. The mouth corresponds to the Earth element; the spleen&#39;s energy connects to it. If food intake is irregular, and injury arises from labor, the mouth cannot discern flavors, nor can it recognize the five tastes. It can also be said that harmful food is evidently the cause of the issue.  </p>
<h3>Oral Ulcer</h3>
<p>The classic states: Heat from the bladder moves to the small intestine, causing discomfort in the diaphragm and intestines, leading to oral ulcers. This condition is common among people who drink alcohol frequently. It is advisable to use Wuling powder and Daohong powder together; it proves effective.<br><strong>Danxi&#39;s Heart Methods, by Zhu Zhenheng (Yuan Dynasty)</strong><a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Mouth Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>For mouth ulcers that do not heal with cold medicine, it is due to the deficiency of the middle jiao and difficulty in eating, with the fire of the yang rising unrestrained. Use the Li Zhong Decoction. Ginseng, white atractylodes, and licorice can replenish the deficiency of the earth; dry ginger can disperse the fire. If severe, add aconite. It is also effective to suck on fragrant cassia; or grind alum into powder and apply it; or hold it in the mouth and rinse with water repeatedly; for severe cases, drink watermelon juice slowly. In winter, if watermelon is unavailable, use burnt watermelon rind ash; or boil huanglian with good wine and sip it for immediate relief. All mouth and tongue sores arise from heat accumulation in the upper jiao. It is advisable to use Sheng Tang; or sweet tangerine soup with a money of yellow qin, and still combine it with willow flower powder.</p>
<p><strong>Variations in Mouth Tastes: Sour, Bitter, Odorous, Spicy, Salty</strong></p>
<p>Heat in the liver causes a sour taste in the mouth, as wood overcomes the spleen, making the mouth also sour. For this, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is appropriate, adding gentian root and green peel; if severe, consider Danggui Longhui Pills. Heat in the heart causes bitterness or ulcers in the mouth; for this, use Liangge San or Xiexin Decoction. If heat from the liver transfers to the gallbladder, the mouth will also taste bitter. Use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding stem of wheat, sour jujube seed, root of dilong, and yuan zhi. If sputum is purulent and blood-streaked like a lung abscess, with foul breath, and other treatments are ineffective, use the Xiaofeng San; mix into gray millet with clear rice drink for relief, two doses can clear it. </p>
<p>If heat is in the lungs, the mouth will taste spicy; use sweet tangerine soup or Xie Bai San. If heat is in the kidneys, the mouth will taste salty; use Zhi Shen Wan or Zi Yin Da Bu Wan. </p>

<h3>Discussion on Oral Lesions</h3>
<p>According to the theory of reversed conditions: Heat from the bladder transfers to the small intestine, causing discomfort in the diaphragm and intestines, resulting in oral lesions. When the heart and stomach are blocked by heat, food and water do not circulate properly and are transmitted down to the small intestine. The Dan Zhi San disperses heat from the small intestine, while the Wu Ling San drains heat from the bladder; thus, the Dan Zhi San is used in conjunction with the Wu Ling San.<br>— Effective Formulas from Contemporary Physicians [Yuan Dynasty, Wei Yilin]</p>
<h3>When Qi of the Viscera is Deficient, It Reflects in the Mouth</h3>
<p>The taste perceived in the mouth is affected by dominant heat (which presents as bitterness) or dominant cold (which presents as saltiness). Accumulated food leads to sourness, irritability leads to dryness, deficiency presents as blandness, abscesses as sweetness, exhaustion causes bad breath, and stagnation results in sores. The saliva of the mouth connects to the five organs; when the Qi of the organs is dominant, the corresponding tastes manifest in the mouth.<br>— Remarkable Effective Formulas [Ming Dynasty, Fang Xian]</p>
<h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The mouth is the channel of the Taiyin meridian, governed by the spleen, and is where the five flavors enter. When flavors are ingested, they are stored in the stomach and spleen, transforming into fluids to nourish the five types of Qi, which correspond to the five organs. When the balance of the five Qi is disrupted, various illnesses arise. For instance, saltiness is associated with cold, sourness with stagnation, dryness with irritability, blandness with deficiency, and heat is related to both bitterness and sweetness. Bad breath indicates dryness and decay in the viscera. Heat accumulates between the chest and diaphragm, resulting in oral manifestations. Oral sores arise from stagnation of spleen Qi, exacerbated by wind and heat. Treatment methods should be adapted according to their causes.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>Mouth Ulcers</p>
<p>Mouth ulcers arise from excess heat in the upper heater, deficient cold in the middle heater, and yin fire in the lower heater, caused by changes in the meridians, and should be treated accordingly. If there is fever and thirst, and the patient drinks cold, it indicates excess heat. For mild cases, use Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang; for severe cases, use Liu Jun Zi Tang. If there is little appetite with loose stools and a lack of central energy, it indicates deficiency of qi; use Ren Shen Li Zhong Tang. If the hands and feet feel cold while the abdomen is painful, it indicates deficiency of cold qi; use Fu Zi Li Zhong Tang. If there is evening heat and internal heat without a consistent pattern, it indicates blood deficiency; use Ba Zhen Tang with Dan Pi, Wu Wei, and Mai Men Dong. If there is thirst with sputum and frequent urination, it indicates deficiency of kidney water; use Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan. If there is little food intake and loose stools, with a pale face and cold limbs, it indicates deficiency of heat and earth; use Ba Wei Wan. If there is evening fever that starts in the abdomen, it indicates yin deficiency; use Si Wu Tang with Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, Wu Wei, and Mai Men Dong, and avoid Jia Jian Ba Wei Wan. If the heat comes and goes, visible during the day and hidden at night, with an inconsistent pattern, sometimes starting in the feet, it indicates a rootless fire; use the previous prescriptions, along with Shi Quan Da Bu Tang with Mai Men Dong and Wu Wei, and apply powdered Fu Zi mixed with saliva to the Yong Quan point. If one uses cold and cool treatments indiscriminately, it will damage vital energy, leading to significant harm.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine [Ming Dynasty, Li Zhan]</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion on Oral Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Heat in the spleen leads to a sweet or foul taste in the mouth, and treatment should be with Huang San or San Huang Decoction. If there is heat in the stomach, the mouth may taste sweet; if the stomach is weak, the taste may be bland. Heat in the liver results in a sour taste, and when wood invades the spleen, the mouth also tastes sour. For this, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Cao Long Dan and Qing Pi is advisable; in severe cases, Dang Gui Long Hui Pill should be used. Heat in the lungs causes a spicy taste, so Gan Ju Decoction or Xie Bai San is recommended. Heat in the kidneys results in a salty taste, for which Zhi Shen Wan or Zhi Yin Da Bu Wan is suitable. Bad breath indicates stomach heat, where deficiency fire accumulates within the chest, leading to halitosis; in this case, use Xiong Zhi Gao. If the stomach’s yang is injured, the mouth will be tasteless; if the kidney’s yin is deficient, a taste will remain in the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points in Diagnosis and Treatment [Ming Dynasty, Dai Si Gong]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oral Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Ulcers on the tongue and inside the mouth are caused by heat obstructing the upper jiao. The treatment should be Sheng Tang or Gan Ju Decoction with a penny of Huang Qin, along with apricot flower powder mixed in; if ineffective, add Si Xiang Drink. When there is deficiency below and excess above, causing oral ulcers, use stabilizing medications to reduce the yang light. It is advisable to use salt water for nourishing the Zheng Dan or He Yan Dan. Also, soak the feet in hot water before bed and pan-fry a small pinch of Wu Zhu Yu. After wiping the feet, apply the fried Zhi to the soles and bind with silk cloth, with men on the left and women on the right.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br><strong>Examination of Medical Formulas</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Wu Kun】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Oral Diseases</strong></p>
<p>For sores and ulcers in the mouth, &quot;Kou Mi San&quot; is the primary treatment. Mouth ulcers stem from damp-heat; if damp-heat does not dissipate, it will inevitably lead to decay. Cold can counteract heat, and bitter substances can strengthen the skin. Therefore, we use the powerful properties of Coptis chinensis, Huangbai, and realgar to kill pests and promote circulation; the cooling effects of ice brain deter pests and penetrate the pores; and the bitterness of myrrh disperses blood and heals wounds. </p>
<p>Master Sun, in the &quot;Thousand Gold Formulas,&quot; says: &quot;The root of wild rose is a divine medicine for mouth sores, which people do not know.&quot; Thus, for those with oral issues, using wild rose root is quite common. Now, I have tasted its medicinal aroma, which is harmonious yet bitter. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;Thin qi is the yin within yang,&quot; and further states, &quot;A strong flavor causes leakage.&quot; This clearly indicates that it is a medicine to clear qi and dissipate heat.</p>
<p>According to the theory of qi convulsion: heat from the bladder is transferred to the small intestine, causing discomfort in the diaphragm and leading to mouth ulcers. The decoction of Bupleurum and Rehmannia is prescribed for this. The bladder is the outlet for water, while the small intestine is the region where clear and turbid substances are separated.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>When the bladder transfers heat to the small intestine, the distinctions between clear and turbid cannot be made, and damp heat cannot be eliminated. This inevitably leads to an upward steaming, causing ulceration and sores in the mouth, resembling meat stew being boiled in a pot. In this formula, Chai Hu is pungent and warm, hence it elevates the clear yang; Di Gu Pi is bitter and cold, therefore it lowers the turbid yin. Once the clear and turbid are delineated, the dry clear and nourishing earth will restore the middle and allow bowel movements to be smooth, healing the mouth&#39;s sores. </p>
<p>For those with solid conditions, add Da Huang and (Shi Bu) Niao. This refers to constipation, where the pathogenic qi is solid. Both yin are obstructed, and the pathway is not open. Thus, Da Huang, being bitter and cold, is used to purge the solid condition, while (Shi Bu) Niao, being salty and cold, softens the hard masses, like drawing out the fire from the stove.</p>
<p>For indecision and weakness in the liver and gallbladder, leading to bitter taste and tongue sores, Yi Dan Tang is indicated. The liver governs deliberation, and the gallbladder governs decision-making. Being overburdened with thoughts leads to qi deficiency. The throat is linked to the gallbladder, and gallbladder bile overflowing into the throat results in a bitter mouth. The wood element can generate fire, leading to tongue sores. </p>
<p>In this formula, Ren Shen and Gan Cao are included to replenish the qi deficiency; Ku Shen and Huang Qin help clear the heat from the qi. The classic states: &quot;When the ruler is clear, the lower will be peaceful.&quot; Therefore, Fu Shen and Yuan Zhi are used to nourish the heart. It also states: &quot;In minor cases treat directly, in severe cases treat indirectly.&quot; Hence, Gui Zhi&#39;s pungent warmth is utilized.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p>
<h3>The Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment 【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang】</h3>
<h4>Pertaining to the Lips</h4>
<p>The lips belong to the foot Taiyin spleen meridian.<br><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;The Spleen is the root of the granaries, the residence of nourishment; its manifestation is in the lips.&quot; (from the &quot;Suwen&quot;)<br>&quot;The Spleen governs defense, guiding the reception of food, and observing the state of the lips and tongue to discern fortune.&quot; (from the &quot;Lingshu&quot;)<br>Thus, when the lips are well-proportioned, the spleen is balanced; when the lips are unevenly positioned, the spleen is unsteady; if the lips are retracted, the spleen is elevated; if the lower lips are enlarged, the spleen is deficient; firm lips indicate a strong spleen, while large and soft lips suggest a fragile spleen. In cases of spleen disease, the lips turn yellow; in severe spleen dysfunction, the lips swell on all sides. Additionally, &quot;The lips and tongue are the basis of muscle. When the foot Taiyin qi is depleted, the pulse does not nourish the muscles; when the pulse does not nourish, the muscles soften. If the muscles are soft, the tongue atrophies, and the area between the lips fills out; when this area fills, the lips retract, indicating that the flesh is failing. The first element is Wood prevailing over Earth.&quot; </p>
<p>They also belong to the foot Yangming stomach meridian.<br><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;Diseases arising from the foot Yangming manifest as swollen lips.&quot; (from the &quot;Lingshu&quot;) The swelling referred to as &quot;swelling&quot; is blood-related. &quot;Swelling&quot; is an ancient term for lip ulcer. Moreover, it is noted that when Yangming qi is present, it may cause lip chewing. &quot;In the case of heat in the stomach, the lips turn black.&quot; (from &quot;Zhuzhong&quot;) </p>
<p>They further belong to the hand Shaoyin heart meridian.<br><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;When both the upper and lower lips are red, it indicates heat in the heart.&quot; (from &quot;Yuan Zhu&quot;) If the upper lip is red and the lower lip is white, it suggests kidney deficiency with heart fire not descending. </p>
<p>They also belong to the hand Shaoyin lung meridian.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> Qian Zhongyang said: The lungs govern the color white; if the lips are white and moist, it is auspicious, but if they are as pale as withered bones, it indicates death. White lips should be treated by nourishing the spleen and lungs, as the spleen is the mother of the lungs. If both mother and child are deficient and cannot nourish each other, this condition is called &quot;timidity,&quot; thus they should be supplemented. If the color is deep red, then it is necessary to disperse the lung&#39;s excessive heat.</p>
<p>The lips are governed by the Chong and Ren meridians. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says that the Chong and Ren meridians both originate in the uterus, follow the back, and are the seas of the meridians. The superficial paths circulate around the abdomen, ascending to meet at the throat, branching off to connect with the lips and mouth. Therefore, when vital energy and blood are abundant, the skin and flesh are warm and firm; when blood alone is abundant, it lightly penetrates the skin and produces fine hair. Women experiencing blood loss have excess energy but insufficient blood, leading to the Chong and Ren meridians not nourishing the lips, hence they appear thin. </p>
<p>The upper lip is associated with the Hand Yangming Large Intestine Meridian.<br>The lower lip is associated with the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian.</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is governed by the spleen and is interlinked with the stomach and large intestine meridians. </p>
<p><strong>The classics say:</strong> The center is yellow; it connects to the spleen, opens at the mouth, and stores essence in the spleen. Further, it states that the spleen governs the mouth; as an organ, it is the spleen, and as an orifice, it is the mouth. Again, the classic states that the spleen&#39;s energy connects to the mouth; when the spleen is harmonious, the mouth can discern the five flavors. This is how the spleen governs the mouth. Additionally, the classics say that the Stomach&#39;s Foot Yangming Meridian connects below the mouth and meets at the Chengjiang point. And, the Large Intestine&#39;s Hand Yangming Meridian connects at the mouth, meeting at the Renzhong point. This illustrates how the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians intersect at the mouth.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p>
<h3>Treatment Methods for Various Symptoms</h3>
<p>When dry, it becomes parched; when hot, it cracks; when windy, it trembles; when cold, it peels. If the lips swell and turn white, and the skin is wrinkled and cracked like a silkworm cocoon, this is termed &quot;cocoon lips.&quot; Some cases have lips swollen like a cocoon, while others have a fine root larger than a cocoon or a lump. This can be caused by emotional disturbances igniting fire and damaging blood, by heart fire affecting the spleen channel, or by excessive flavors accumulating heat and harming the spleen. </p>
<p>The essential point is to assess the primary condition and consider any accompanying issues. Nourishing spleen qi to generate spleen blood will lead to moisture returning and fire being extinguished, causing wind to dissipate and swelling to subside. If the patient neglects this or if the practitioner fails to recognize the situation, recklessly using clearing heat and detoxifying medications, or improperly applying treatment, could lead to exacerbation of symptoms.</p>
<p>For kidney deficiency causing lip cocoons, with occasional bleeding and internal heat leading to dry mouth, phlegm, and weight loss, &quot;Jiyi Yin Dihuang Wan&quot; should be used. </p>
<p>For liver channel heat due to anger, with wind heat affecting the spleen causing swelling and cracking of the lips, &quot;Chai Hu Qing Gan San&quot; should be indicated. </p>
<p>For stomach fire leading to blood dryness, resulting in cracking lips and painful gum ulcers, &quot;Qing Wei San&quot; is appropriate, possibly adding Paeonia and Angelica or Chai Hu to address heat in the spleen, stomach, liver, and gallbladder channels. </p>
<p>If wind heat spreads to the spleen, causing trembling and wrinkling of the lips, along with dizziness or swelling of the limbs resembling wind, &quot;Qiang Huo San&quot; is recommended. </p>
<p>For wind heat stagnating in the spleen channel leading to dry and cracked lips without color, &quot;Xie Huang Yin Zi&quot; should be used. </p>
<p>In cases of damaged central qi causing sores on the lips and mouth, chills and fever, along with a feeling of fatigue, &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang&quot; is advised. </p>
<p>If worry and overthinking harm the spleen, depleting blood and causing wrinkled lips, &quot;Gui Pi Tang&quot; is appropriate.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>Excessive thinking generates heat in the spleen, leading to symptoms like dry lips and mouth, ulceration, and long-lasting sores. For internal treatment, take the Five Blessings Detoxification Pill; for external treatment, use ashes from roasted olives mixed with pig fat for application, or finely grind the kernel and apply it. </p>
<p>For sweet taste in the mouth, use raw Rehmannia, Peony, Coptis, and Sanhuang Pill. For bitter taste in the mouth, use Bupleurum, Scutellaria, Coptis, Sophora, Gentian, and Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding Ophiopogon, sour jujube seed, Rehmannia root, and Polygala. The Inner Canon states that a bitter mouth signifies gallbladder obstruction. The liver governs planning, and the gallbladder governs decision-making; an excess of bile leads to the gallbladder becoming indecisive, causing anger, which results in qi rebounding and bile overflowing, hence the bitter taste. If the heat is severe, use Long Dan Decoction to address it.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>Mouth Ulcers</p>
<p>Mouth ulcers, also known as heat. The classics state: when the lesser yang governs the heavens, fire energy descends, and lung energy ascends, this leads to mouth ulcers. The second type is cold. The classics say: when the yearly metal does not suffice, the fiery heat progresses, subsequently cold rain violently arrives, the yin is blocked, and the yang rises, resulting in the disease of mouth ulcers.</p>
<p>Someone may ask how mouth ulcers are caused. It is said: the classics explain that the bladder transfers heat to the small intestine, causing the diaphragm and intestines to be obstructed, leading to oral sores. The small intestine is the organ related to the heart; this situation arises due to the influence of evil heat. The heart is associated with the sovereign fire, the main organ among the five viscera and six bowels. Thus, all the heat from the classics corresponds to the heart; the heart&#39;s channels are distributed to the tongue. If heart fire rises excessively and vaporizes in the mouth, it causes sores on the tongue. The spleen&#39;s channels are distributed beneath the tongue; if spleen heat generates phlegm, and heated saliva interacts, rising from the fire, ulcers can also occur, often in greater numbers. </p>
<p>For both conditions, all cold and cool agents can treat them, but if there is saliva, it is necessary to also address the saliva. What then if someone uses a middle-of-the-road decoction with added aconite to treat it? It is said: fire has both deficiency and excess. When there is originally heat in the channels, but it moves excessively, this is called excess; when it moves without heat, this is called deficiency. For excess, the correct treatment is with cold and cool agents; for deficiency, the treatment should be with warmth. The middle-of-the-road decoction is used when the stomach is deficient and the grain is sparse, thereby opposing the counteracting kidney water energy, turning into cold internally.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>When the spleen and stomach are weak and their fire is forced to rise, resulting in mouth sores, ginseng, Atractylodes, and licorice are used to nourish the earth, while ginger and Aconite are used to dispel the cold, allowing the fire to receive assistance and retreat. In the &quot;Sheng Ji Zong Lu,&quot; it is said that for a cold deficiency of the original organs that leads to mouth sores, one should use a powder of Ba Jiu, Bai Zhi, and Gao Liang Jiang, along with cooked pig kidney. There are also methods using clove, pepper, pine resin, powdered Xixin, and Su Mu decoction to apply to the sores. For those who cannot eat, angelica, Aconite, and white honey should be sucked and swallowed; some apply fresh Aconite to the soles of the feet, or use powdered Wu Zhu Yu boiled with vinegar to create a paste, mixed with fresh Dihong to apply to the soles of both feet. These methods are all for treating the fire of the dragon. It is due to cold water pressing up that the yang of the heart and lungs cannot descend, hence warm and hot remedies are utilized, either dispersing upward or downward, or benefiting from the yin following the yang.</p>
<p>If there is heat in the stomach and the pulse is strong and large, it is advisable to take Liang Ge San, Gan Ju Tang with three Supplement Pills of Huang Qin, Jin Hua Wan, rinse with Huang Lian Sheng Ma Tang, and apply Lv Pao San or Mi Bo San. Dan Xi recommends slowly drinking watermelon juice; if there is nothing to burn the skin to powder, apply powdered Xixin and Huang Lian mixed into it externally.</p>
<p>According to the Hu family&#39;s prescription, finely grind a weevil and apply it, which is effective immediately. This is deemed the correct remedy for transferring heat from the bladder to the small intestine. The weevil specifically travels to the small intestine and bladder, opening the pathways; it has a potent and strong energy, which may lead to sores from yin deficiency and upward-ascending energy, thus should be avoided unless there is substantial heat in the upper jiao.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br><strong>Surgical Classic</strong> 【Ming Dynasty – Chen Shigong】</p>
<p><strong>Lip Wind</strong></p>
<p>When the stomach fire of the Yangming channel ascends, it causes itching and swelling of the lower lip, leading to cracking and weeping without pain, making it difficult to heal. One should use a copper powder pill for soaking and washing, and internally take the Liuwei Dihuang Wan for self-healing.</p>
<p><strong>Chapped Lips</strong></p>
<p>Chapped lips are a manifestation of the Yangming stomach channel. They occur due to overeating fried and scorched foods, coupled with intense worry and anxiety, which causes phlegm to follow the fire, accumulating in the lips. Initially, it resembles a bean and gradually enlarges like a silkworm cocoon, becoming swollen and hard. In severe cases, it becomes painful, hinders eating, may rupture and bleed, and over time can lead to diabetes or difficult-to-treat internal conditions. </p>
<p>For early stages or established cases without internal issues, use large moxa sticks on the affected area, apply a toad venom cake, and cover with a plaster; over time, this will gradually dissipate. For those with thirst as an internal issue, it is advisable to take Jiawei Bamei Wan early and drink Qingliang Ganlu beverage at noon to nourish the source of digestion. If bleeding persists for an extended period, leading to weakness, internal heat with phlegm, a dark complexion, red cheeks, and severe dryness and thirst, it indicates a condition that is difficult to treat.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br><strong>Mouth Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>Mouth ulcers can be categorized into deficient fire and excess fire, as well as pale color and red color. Deficient fire appears pale with white spots and fine dots; in severe cases, it shows crack-like patterns resembling turtle shells, with a weak pulse and no thirst. This is caused by excessive worry, with more wakefulness than sleep, leading to the eruption of deficient fire. It is treated with Si Wu Decoction combined with Lian Qiao, Zhimu, Dan Pi, and Rougui to guide the treatment. Externally, it is treated by applying willow flower powder. Excess fire, on the other hand, appears red with deep ulcers in the mouth, and in severe cases, the cheeks and tongue swell, the pulse is full, and there is dry mouth. This is caused by rich foods, thick flavors, and strong alcoholic beverages that provoke the heart fire. It is advisable to use Liangge Powder, and externally apply Fuyan Powder; expelling saliva will lead to improvement. If there are ulcers on the tongue, and it is dry, yellow, and hard with thirst, the Bawei Pill should be adjusted to nourish the source of digestion, and water rinsing should be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Method for Treating Drooping Chin</strong></p>
<p>Drooping chin occurs due to Qi deficiency, which prevents the closure of the orifice. Instruct the patient to sit upright, supporting the chin with both hands, placing the thumbs inside the mouth, pressing on the upper molars tightly against the lower cheeks, and using force to press downward towards the shoulders, sending energy upwards to the back of the head. Then, use a silk strip to wrap around the chin at the top for about half an hour, and then remove it; this will result in recovery.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br><strong>The Complete Book of Jingyue</strong> (Ming, Zhang Jiebin)</p>
<p><strong>The Disease of Thirst and Dryness</strong></p>
<p>There is a significant difference between thirst and dryness, but many people cannot discern this. Thirst arises from an excess of fire and dryness from insufficient fluids. An excess of fire should be treated as real heat; insufficient fluids should be treated as a deficiency of yin. If these two conditions are not distinguished, it is akin to mixing ice and fire. However, although thirst is related to fire, there are several types that should be recognized: for instance, thirst from real heat, which indicates excess fire; and thirst from lacking yin, which indicates insufficient water. Therefore, following a significant loss of fluids due to severe diarrhea, heavy sweating, great exertion, major illness, postpartum blood loss, major boils, and after overeating salty foods, all can lead to thirst. All these cases stem from loss of yin and fluids, resulting in diminished water and dryness, and are not a manifestation of heat, so they should not be misinterpreted as fire symptoms. In summary, if one feels thirsty and likes cold drinks, with a strong pulse that feels bound, this is indeed a sign of fire. If cold drinks lead to stagnation and they prefer hot drinks while having a weak pulse and loose stool, this is not a fire symptom. Furthermore, those with dry mouths may experience bitterness but have no desire for tea or soup; this indicates dryness, not thirst. This particularly pertains to signs of yin deficiency; if one treats this condition as thirst, how can it be without error? Therefore, the method of treatment should focus on clearing heat from the lungs and stomach if fire is prevalent above; and if water is deficient below, one should replenish the spleen and kidneys. If yang is deficient and there is no means for yin to generate, and if qi is deficient and essence cannot transform, then without a harmonious balance of water and fire, what benefit could there be?<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>The Taste of Bitterness and Sourness</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of a bitter or sour mouth are all attributed to heat in the &quot;Yuan Bing Shi.&quot; It states that liver heat leads to a sour mouth, heart heat to a bitter mouth, spleen heat to a sweet mouth, lung heat to a spicy mouth, and kidney heat to a salty mouth. If the mouth is bland, it is also due to stomach heat. According to this reasoning, all instances of the five tastes in the mouth would belong to heat syndromes, with no possibility of deficiency or cold diseases—could this not be erroneous? For instance, a bitter mouth does not necessarily come solely from heart fire; a bland mouth is not solely caused by stomach heat. In fact, excessive thinking and fatigue, as well as excessive desires, often lead to symptoms of a bitter mouth and dry tongue, with a lack of taste in food. Such issues do not stem from the heart or spleen, but rather from the liver and kidneys. If the heart and spleen are deficient, the liver and gallbladder can overflow with evil and cause bitterness; if the liver and kidneys are deficient, a lack of true yin results in dryness. Similarly, a bland mouth can arise after great labor, severe diarrhea, excessive sweating, or serious illness, which certainly does not mean it is solely due to stomach fire, does it? Therefore, when encountering such cases, one should examine whether there are no other heat syndromes or heat pulses, and it would be inappropriate to hastily assume internal heat caused by overexertion and recklessly use cold treatments.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Foul Breath</strong></p>
<p>Although bad breath is caused by stomach heat, there are also non-heat variations. The foul smell from stomach heat is indeed filthy and often accompanies symptoms like dry mouth and heat in the mouth, as well as other signs of Yangming fire. However, if there are no signs of fire and the smell resembles that of rotten food or sourness, with symptoms like sourness in the stomach and tongue, or food stagnation with belching, it indicates the stench of dampness retaining filth, which is different from the heat-related foulness. This suggests issues related to failure of thoughts and a weakened spleen unable to transform food. Thus, we have one case of Yang syndrome that should clear stomach heat, and another of Yin syndrome that should nourish the heart and spleen. It is incorrect to assume that all foulness must be heat-related, as this could lead to other illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Presence or Absence of Heat</strong></p>
<p>Diseases of the mouth and tongue can manifest as sores, foulness, dryness, thirst, or a variety of bitter and sour tastes. While many classical texts categorize oral diseases as heat-related, there are also conditions resembling heat but not truly heat-related, as well as fatigue without fire, which cannot all be classified as heat-related.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Mouth Ulcers</p>
<p>Mouth and tongue sores are mostly caused by heat in the upper burner, and treatment should focus on clearing heat. However, if there is excessive fatigue due to alcohol consumption, accompanied by a weak pulse and insufficient central qi, then cold and cooling methods will not be effective. Therefore, after prolonged use of cooling methods without results, one should investigate the underlying causes. An approach may involve tonifying the heart and spleen, nourishing kidney water, using Li Zhong Decoction, or employing honey and prepared Aconite; only then can one achieve complete recovery. This illustrates the need to distinguish between cold and heat.</p>
<p>Treatment Method</p>
<p>For mouth ulcers with a bitter taste, and for symptoms of heat in the three burners, sweet dew drink or Xi Xin drink should be used. In cases of severe heat, Cool the Diaphragm Powder or Yuan Shen Powder should be employed. If there is excess stomach fire, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction or San Huang Pill. For heart and liver fire, use Xie Xin Decoction or Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction. In cases of damp heat from alcohol leading to oral ulcers, Da Duan Qing Drink, Da Fen Qing Drink, or Wu Ling Powder should be prescribed. If there’s damage to the heart and spleen with accompanying fire, Er Yin Decoction or Qing Xin Lotus Seed Drink may be used. If one’s thoughts and plans are frustrated leading to liver and gallbladder deficiency with bitterness in the mouth, Qi Fu Drink, Li Yin Decoction, or Wu Jun Zi Decoction may be administered. If there is excessive fire, herbs like Huang Qin and Long Dan Cao should be added as needed.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>For cases of mouth sores with six pulses weak, or those that don&#39;t improve after long use of cold remedies, it is essential to address the underlying rootless heat. One should consider treatments like Yin decoctions or the Principle Middle Soup. Using cassia to chew and swallow is also acceptable. </p>
<p>For external treatment of mouth sores, options include Yin-Yang Powder, Green Cloud Powder, Xixin and Huangbo Powder, and White Silkworm and Huangbo Powder. It can also be effective to hold Sichuan Huangbo in the mouth overnight. If there are sores and ulcers on the tongue, Ice Jade Powder should be administered. For decay due to improper diet, Ice White Powder is recommended. If bad breath is due to stomach heat, treatments like Stomach Clearing Decoction, Shengma and Huanglian Pill, or Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction with fragrance should be used; or the Thousand Gold Bad Breath Formula can help clear the heat internally. Furthermore, options like Clove Pill, Holy Benefit Tooth Formula, and Fujian Fragrant Tea Cakes can temporarily alleviate the foulness.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mouth Sores</strong></p>
<p>Mouth and tongue sores arise from the accumulation of heart fire. Take three qian of Huanglian and one qian of Changpu, decoct in water and take as a single dose to achieve cure; this is a marvelous formula. The uniqueness of this remedy lies not in Huanglian but in Changpu. Changpu is a medicine that leads to the heart channel. Although Huanglian also enters the heart channel, it inevitably involves the liver and spleen, whereas Changpu solely targets the heart. Furthermore, without being mixed with medicines from other channels, it acts decisively; thus, there is no doubt of its efficacy. This is why it works so effectively. If one does not understand the subtleties of using these herbs and mixes them with liver and spleen medicines, although they may still work, they will ultimately not be as swift as a beating drum. This is yet another method for treating heat. When sores appear on the mouth or tongue, light and clear substances should be used, applying them sparingly will yield immediate effects, similar to the formula of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. However, many do not understand the balance in this formula; I will refine it further, so it may serve as a lasting model.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>Take one dram of Chai Hu, one dram of Huang Qin, one dram of Ban Xia, five cents of Chen Pi, and one dram of Gan Cao. This is Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. I further add five cents of Ren Shen and two drams of Fu Ling to make it even more extraordinary. When qi is sufficient, evil can easily be expelled, and sweating can easily occur. People in the world see the use of Ren Shen and feel faint, not only do physicians hesitate to use it, but even patients are afraid to take it, leading to a situation where many remain incurable. How can we spread the word to all the doctors in the world to carefully investigate the source of illness and use it wisely?</p>
<p>For those with sores in the mouth, it is due to heat in the heart channel. It is advisable to use cooling herbs like Huang Lian and Huang Qin to disperse the heat, and they will heal naturally. However, currently, there is none used. Use one dram of Huang Bo, one dram of Jiang Can, five cents of scorched Zhi Ke, five cents of honey-fried Gan Cao powder, five cents of mint powder, three grains of Bing Pian, and five cents of Shan Dou Gen, all powdered finely. Soak this mixture, apply three times a day. By the first day, there will be quick relief; by the next day, full recovery. This is a miraculous formula. The above is a method for treating serious conditions.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Cleft Lip</strong></p>
<p>When a person experiences extreme heat, their tongue feels like a thorn, and their lips and mouth crack, leading to intense thirst and a call for drink. Although this condition is not caused by a fever, anyone suffering from this illness, even without a fever, will not survive for long. Bai Hu Tang can also provide relief; however, if it is too cold, it may harm the stomach&#39;s energy, often resulting in a reduction of heat that leads to further complications, ultimately resulting in demise. Therefore, Bai Hu Tang should not be used lightly. </p>
<p>I have a remedy called Qing Liang San: two taels of Yuanshen, one tael of Maidong, five qian each of Chamomile and Qinghao, three qian each of White Mustard Seed, Shengdi, and Cheqianzi, all boiled in water for consumption. The brilliance of this formula lies in the fact that Yuanshen serves as the monarch to relieve the fires of the upper jiao; Maidong acts as the minister to resolve the heat in the lungs. Chamomile and Qinghao serve as assistants to eliminate the fire in the stomach. Particularly remarkable are Cheqianzi, White Mustard Seed, and Shengdi as emissaries, either transforming phlegm or cooling the blood, all of which help expel the great heat from below the bladder. This way, the balance between the upper and lower parts of the body remains cool, dispelling heat without harming the stomach. Thus, it can support the critically ill without causing complications.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Mouth Ulcer Formulas</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: The Emperor asked: If someone suffers from a bitter mouth, one should use Yanglingquan. What is the name of this disease? How is it caused? Qibo replied: It is called &quot;dampness of the gallbladder.&quot; The liver is the strategist within the body. It depends on the gallbladder, and the throat serves as its conduit. Such a person often contemplates but cannot resolve decisions. Hence, the gallbladder is weak, causing qi to overflow upward, resulting in a bitter mouth. Treat it with gallbladder acupoint GB34. </p>
<p>For a dry throat and a hot feeling in the mouth like glue, one should use the foot little yin point. The &quot;Lingshu Classic&quot; states: In febrile diseases, the body first becomes dry, feels hot, and has vexation; with dry lips and mouth, use the skin, applying the first needle at the point number fifty-nine. If there is skin swelling, dry mouth, cold sweat, and the pulse at the heart cannot be felt, examine the kidneys. </p>

<p>Foaming at the mouth and convulsions can be treated with the point SI 3. If there is deviation and difficulty in closing the mouth, use the point SJ 5. For paralysis, incapacitated arms and wrists, and inability to close the lips, use the point LI 4.

<p>In syncope, with deviation and loss of consciousness, pain in the lower teeth, cheek swelling, chills, inability to close the mouth, and the tongue unable to speak or chew, use the point ST 9. If there is deviation and a lack of consciousness, inability to open the mouth, use the point GB 20.

<p>The &quot;Ten Books of Dongyuan&quot; states: For any mouth sores, regardless of whether they are new or old, at night sleep with two pills and massage them gently with your hands back and forth 30 to 50 times. When sleeping, do this several times, and it will be alleviated.</p>
<p>The &quot;Essentials for Preserving Life&quot; states: For dry mouth guiding techniques, rub the soles of both feet 36 times, and synchronize with breathing. When saliva returns, swallow it. This should be practiced six times, along with subsequent exercises. Use your tongue to press against the palate at the Yongchuan point, allowing a flow of cool water, gradually lifting it to your throat. </p>
<p>Another method: Visualize a pool of cool water beneath your throat and mentally lift it into your mouth. You may either press your tongue against the palate or the underside of the palate, allowing saliva to form, or raise either kidney water or Yongchuan water.</p>
<p>If there is heat in the diaphragm causing a dry mouth, push it open at the heart level, visualize kidney water rising to cleanse the heart area without making a sound; or think of the back tongue pressing against the palate, and saliva will naturally form. If you cannot speak, first open the lung meridian, connect the kidney water to wash the heart and lungs, then press on the side of the tongue, allowing the lungs to act like a canopy over the heart. If unable to speak, it is due to an overactive fire causing the lungs to dry out; only kidney water can moisten them.</p>
<p>For tongue poisoning, clear the lung meridian by pressing the tongue against the palate and visualize water washing over the tongue, then exhale the heart&#39;s fire.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Family Guidelines&quot; states: A man has been suffering from mouth sores for several years, experiencing pain in his mouth, throat, and stomach. He dares not eat hot food; every time he vomits, has diarrhea, or sweats, he feels weakened. After taking Huanglian Jiedu (a herbal remedy), he began to recover in less than ten days.</p>
<p>Zhao Ping’s family had a man in his twenties suffering from an extremely foul odor coming from his mouth, so much so that relatives would not speak to him. An expert said: “The Metal element of the lungs is responsible for odors, and when Metal is refined by Fire, it leads to a burnt, foul smell. Over time, this can result in decay, which pertains to the Kidneys. When this heat is extreme, it also affects the water metabolism. The disease is in the upper part of the body and should be treated with emetics. First, a tea should be used to prepare to induce vomiting and release seventy percent of the condition. At night, take Zhouche Pills and Jun Chuan Powder to move the bowels five to seven times, and by morning, the foul odor will cease. Alas! Those who suffer from bad breath throughout their lives are mistakenly thought to have a connection between the lungs and stomach, resulting in the odor. This is a fallacious theory.”<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>The &quot;Hygiene Treasure&quot; states: Liang Jimin, who indulged in rich food and excessive drinking, suffered from overthinking, causing harm to the lung&#39;s metal, resulting in foul breath, thick and sticky mucus, discomfort in the throat, and a bitter, dry mouth. This calls for the prescription of the modified Xie Bai San. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: the heart governs the five odors, and when entering the lungs, it results in a fishy scent, which is one aspect of it. This is due to the damage caused by excessive heat from consuming large amounts of fluid, which results in heart fire burning the lung metal. Therefore, mulberry bark and earth bone bark, which are slightly bitter and cool, are used to suppress the lurking fire in the lungs, while supplements for Qi are considered primary. Huang Qin and Zhi Mu, which are bitter and cold, treat the fishy odor and clear lung Qi, becoming secondary in function. To help the lungs consolidate, sour foods should be consumed to draw it in, while Shí Wèi Zi, being sour and warm, also helps to consolidate lung Qi. Mai Men Dong, being bitter and cold, treats thick and sticky mucus and a dry, bitter mouth, serving as an assistant. Jie Geng, which is acrid and warm but light and floating, treats phlegm rebellion and benefits the throat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: The prefect Liu Kexin suffered from chapped lips that occasionally bled, accompanied by internal heat, dry mouth, and thinness, showing signs of kidney deficiency. After using Ji Yin Di Huang Wan for about a year, he recovered.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar, who fell ill from labor in the heat, developed sores on his lips. Some used Si Wu decoction with Huang Lian and Zhi Mu and recovered. However, the condition recurred, and the same medicine was used again, worsening the symptoms with a cold sensation in the abdomen. I then prescribed Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang with additional Fu Ling and Ban Xia, which successfully treated him.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>Confucian scholar Yang Guohua became swollen and painful in the lips and ears due to anger, experiencing chills and fever.

<p>A man who was prone to anger suffered from swollen lips and, when taking digestive and anti-fire medications, experienced bleeding. He was thin and emaciated. I prescribed a restorative formula (Buzhong Yiqi Tang) with Banxia, Fuling, and Jiegeng added. After a month, the swelling gradually subsided, and his vitality improved. I then adjusted the formula with Siwu decoction, adding Chaihu, fried Shan Zhi, Danpi, Shengma, and licorice in several doses. Finally, I removed the Shan Zhi and added Ren Shen and Bai Zhu, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>A woman who was emotionally repressed for a long time developed chapped lips. She had mixed treatments that dispelled food and reduced fire, but all signs of deficiency were evident, and she experienced profuse sweating like rain, a condition of Qi and blood deficiency combined with heat. I prescribed the Danggui Liu Huang Decoction, incorporating Huangqin, Lian, and banxiao, cooked black; after two doses, her sweating abruptly stopped. I then gave her Gui Pi Tang and Ba Zhen San together for a gradual recovery of her vitality. Further, I alternated with Xiao Yao San and Gui Pi Tang, taking over a hundred doses until her lips healed.</p>
<p>Another woman, also emotionally troubled for a long time, sometimes experienced stomach discomfort, chest congestion, irregular menstrual cycles, diminished strength and appetite, daily fevers, weariness, and had swollen lips for over a year. I prescribed Gui Pi Tang with fried Huanglian, Shan Zhi added along with a touch of Wuzhuyu; the discomfort and bloating quickly disappeared, but her intake was still low. Then I removed Huanglian and added Beimu and Yuan Zhi, which alleviated her chest congestion, allowing her to eat normally. I further adjusted with an improved version of Xiao Yao San and Gui Pi Tang, alternating over a hundred doses, and after a month her menstrual cycle normalized, and her lips finally healed.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>A woman suffered from a cleft lip and internal heat for two years. Whenever symptoms arose, she took cold and cooling medicines, which caused bleeding and worsened her other symptoms. I treated her with an upgraded version of the Qingwei Powder, and she recovered. Later, after an outburst of anger, her lips swelled, accompanied by cold and heat, and vomiting occurred. I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with gardenia fruit, poria, and platycodon, and all her symptoms quickly improved. I then used an enhanced version of the Xiaoyao Powder, resulting in her full recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman, prone to anger, had slight swelling of her lower lip and experienced internal heat and fatigue. I gave her phlegm-dissolving medicine, but she had a reduced appetite, experienced vomiting, and had ineffective bowel movements, with bleeding from her lips. I treated her to regulate qi and eliminate chest stagnation, but she still had dizziness, lip swelling, and irregular menstruation. I then used Qingwei to move blood, which eased her fatigue, reduced fever and restlessness, and caused excessive salivation. I noted that her emotional distress had harmed her liver and spleen, yielding wrong treatment through attack. Therefore, I prescribed Jisheng Guipi Decoction to improve appetite and bowel movements, followed by an enhanced Xiaoyao Powder to relieve swelling and reduce heat. I then used Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction to strengthen her spleen and stop salivation. </p>
<p>Subsequently, due to another angry episode, she developed chills, ear pain, chest fullness, and severe lip swelling, suggesting her anger had ignited liver fire, damaging yin and blood. I prescribed the Four Substances Decoction combined with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction and added gardenia fruit, which quickly alleviated her condition. After another fit of anger, her hypochondriac area and breasts felt swollen, her abdomen hurt, and she had sour vomiting, with no intake of food and difficulty urinating. This indicated anger affecting the liver wood, disrupting the spleen earth. I treated her with Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction, adding chuanxiong and peony, which led to her recovery. However, from overexertion and anger, her appetite waned, she experienced fever and shortness of breath, felt fatigued, had severe blood loss akin to a collapse, and pronounced lip swelling. This reflected liver heat unable to retain blood, and spleen qi deficiency unable to contain blood. I treated her with Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction, enhanced with roasted black gardenia, peony, and moutan, leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>A man experienced internal heat leading to thirst, coughing up phlegm, and had hard and dry bowel movements.

Disbelieving, he took herbs like Erchen and Qinian instead. The next year, his lower lip gradually swelled, and his urination became red and painful. Clinging to the previous medication, his lips bled, his bowel movements became black and blocky, and his urination was dribbling. He asked me to treat him. I said: The black dry stool and dribbling urination indicate liver and kidney failure. The swelling and whiteness of the lips signify spleen deficiency. He refused further treatment and eventually passed away.</p>

I prescribed the Four Substance with stir-fried gardenia and stir-fried gentian as one formula, and further used the modified Xiao Yao San to help her recover.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>In autumn, Master Zhao of the officials reported sores in the mouth, fatigue from exertion, fever, and aversion to cold. This is a sign of internal injury to the qi and blood; treating it with Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction plus Five-Flavor and Mai Dong resulted in recovery.</p>
<p>Scholar Liu Huafu had sores in the mouth, a severe heat in the morning, and a rapid yet strong pulse. He was slightly improved with the Qing Xin Lian Zi Decoction. Further treatment with Shi Wu Er Lian Decoction led to full recovery. Later, due to labor, he experienced evening fevers and a rapid yet weak pulse, treated with Shi Wu Decoction plus Ren Shen, Bai Zhu, and Chai Hu to slightly alleviate symptoms. However, he remained fatigued and dry in the mouth; thus, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Decoction was used again to restore his health.</p>
<p>Master Liu from the armory had mouth sores and thirst for soup, indicating insufficient stomach qi unable to generate fluids, treated with the Qi Wei Bai Zhu Powder for recovery.</p>
<p>Court reviewer Qu Ru had a condition where the inside of the mouth appeared skinless, and he experienced throat pain, with a preference for hot food and drinks. This indicates true cold in the middle and false heat externally. He was treated with the modified Ba Wei Pills and recovered.</p>
<p>Scholar Fei Huaide had a fever with a mouth condition resembling a lack of skin. He was treated with cooling and fire-reducing medicine, displaying a red face and experiencing fever, nausea, and reduced appetite with phlegm. This was due to a deficiency of the spleen and stomach&#39;s cold injury. Treatment with Fu Zi Li Zhong Decoction was given to warm and nourish the spleen and stomach, with the Ba Wei Pills supporting the mingmen fire leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another scholar experienced a bitter and spicy mouth, indicating lung and liver fire. Initially, treatment with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction plus Shan Zhi, Dan Cao, Fu Ling, and Sang Pi gradually improved his condition. Continued treatment with Liu Jun Zi Decoction augmented with Shan Zhi and Shao Yao led to full recovery. If experiencing a bitter mouth, rib distension, and dripping urination, it indicates a liver channel issue, treated with Liu Wei Pills to nourish and cleanse the source of digestion.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>A man has bad breath, his gums are inflamed and rotten, and his knees are weak and soft. Medications such as Huangbo may aggravate the condition. Occasionally, he experiences a salty taste in his mouth, indicating deficient heat in the kidney meridian; using Liuwei Dihuang Wan can cure it completely.</p>
<p>A woman suffers from a bitter taste in her mouth and a distended side. Treatment with Xiao Chaihu, Shan Zhi, and Huang Lian results in slight improvement. Further treatment with Sijunzi Tang, adding Shaoyao and Danggui, leads to recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman, whenever she gets angry, experiences bitterness in her mouth and a feeling of heat, especially in the evening. Treatment with Xiao Chaihu combined with Sihua results in two doses. Subsequent treatment with Sihua plus Chaihu, Baizhu, Fuling, and Danpi brings about recovery.</p>
<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states that Xuanwen Bing has incessant drooling, enjoys laughing, and has a dull pulse. Using Lian, Qin, Bo, Zhi, Baizhu, Banxia, bamboo juice, and ginger juice results in the cessation of drooling and laughter within five days.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; mentions that Yan Wen Jing, aged over seventy, has not ceased sexual relations. He daily consumes countless warming and nourishing medicines. Additionally, he makes congee with ginseng and soup with Cistanchus, leading to hot stomach, oral ulcers, loose teeth, and foul breath, making it nearly unbearable to approach him. Multiple attempts to use cold, cooling medicines for the stomach have been ineffective. There is a desire to use ginger and cinnamon as adjuncts. Please provide a resolution. I say: Using them will definitely result in serious issues. The main treatment should be an adjusted version of Ganlu Drink in eight doses to restore balance.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　茧唇者，此证生于嘴唇也，其形似蚕茧，故名之。《内经》云：脾气开于口，又云：脾之荣在唇。但燥则干，热则裂，风则瞤，寒则揭。若肿起白皮皱裂如蚕茧，故定名曰茧唇也。始起一小瘤，如豆大；或再生之，渐渐肿大，合而为一，约有寸厚；或翻花如杨梅，如疙瘩，如灵芝，如菌，形状不一，皆由六气七情相感而成。或心思太过忧虑过深，则心火焦炽，传授脾经；或食酽酒厚味，积热伤脾，而肾水枯竭以致之。须审其病证之因，惟补肾水，生脾血，则燥自润，火自除，风自息，肿自消矣。此亦异证，所生者少，人亦难晓。若久不愈者，急用金银烙铁在艾火内烧红荡之，内服归脾养荣汤，庶易愈矣。若外用追蚀恶毒线结之法，反为所伤，慎哉慎哉！若妇人患此，阴血衰少故也。宜用四物逍遥散治之。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>　　　　指迷论 【宋　钱乙】</p>

<p>　　日疮糜烂者，口糜散主之。盖口糜本于湿热，湿热不去，必至疳蚀，寒可以胜热，苦可以坚肤，故用黄连、黄蘗、雄黄之悍，杀虫而利气；冰脑之窜，杀虫而入腠；没药之苦，散血而愈疮。　　孙真人《千金方》云：蔷薇根，口疮之神药，人不知之。故其口齿一门，用蔷薇根者，盖多方焉。今尝其药气平而味苦。《内经》曰：气薄，为阳中之阴，又曰：味厚则泄。如此言之，固清气泄热之药也。　　气厥论曰：膀胱移热于小肠，膈肠不便，上为口糜。柴胡地骨皮汤主之。盖膀胱者，水道之所出，小肠者清浊泌别之区也。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>膀胱移热于小肠，则清浊不能泌别，湿热不去，势必上蒸，故令口中糜烂而疮，乃灶底燃薪笼中肉糜之象也。是方也，柴胡辛温，所以升其清阳；地骨皮苦寒，所以降其浊阴。清浊既判，则干清坤宁，膈肠利而口糜愈矣。实者加大黄、(石卜)硝。谓大便秘濇，邪气自实。二阴皆秘，地道不通。故用大黄苦寒以泻实，(石卜)硝咸寒以软坚，乃灶底抽薪之法也。　　谋虑不决，肝胆气虚，口苦舌疮者，益胆汤主之。盖肝主谋虑，胆主决断，劳于谋虑决断，故令气虚。咽门为胆之使，胆汁上溢于咽，故令口苦。木能生火，故令舌疮。是方也，人参、甘草，所以补其气虚；苦参、黄芩，所以清其气热。经曰：主明则下安。故用茯神、远志以养心。又曰：微者正治，甚者从治。故用官桂之辛热。<a id="orig-22p" href="#trans-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>　　　　证治准绳 【明　王肯堂】</p>

<p>　　　　　渴干之病</p>
<p>　　口渴口干，大有不同，而人多不能辨。盖渴因火燥有余，干因津液不足。火有余者，当以实热论；津液不足者，当以阴虚论。二者不分，反同冰炭矣。然渴虽云火而亦有数种当辨者：如实热之渴，火有余也；亡阴之渴，水不足也。故凡于大泻之后，大汗之后，大劳之后，大病之后，新产失血之后，痈疽大溃之后，过食咸味之后，皆能作渴。凡此数者，悉由亡阴亡液，水亏枯涸而然，本非热证，不得误认为火。总之，渴而喜冷，脉实便结者，固火证也。其有冷饮入腹，则滞沃不行，或口虽作渴，而但喜热饮及脉弱便溏者，皆非火证。矧复有口虽干苦而全然不欲茶汤者，此干也，非渴也。尤属阴虚之候，若作渴治，能无误乎？故治此之法，凡火盛于上者，宜清肺清胃；水亏于下者，宜补脾补肾。若阳虚而阴无以生，气虚而精无以化者，使非水火并济，则何益之有哉！<a id="orig-31p" href="#trans-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>　　　　　苦酸之味</p>
<p>　　口苦口酸等证，在《原病式》则皆指为热，谓肝热则口酸，心热则口苦，脾热则口甘，肺热则口辛，肾热则口咸。或口淡者，亦胃热也。若据此说，则凡以口中之有五味者，悉属火证而绝无虚寒之病矣，岂不谬哉！如口苦者，未必悉由心火；口淡者，未必尽因胃热。盖以思虑劳倦，色欲过度者，多有口苦舌燥，饮食无味之证。此其咎不在心脾，则在肝肾。心脾虚则肝胆邪溢而为苦，肝肾虚则真阴不足而为燥。即如口淡一证，凡大劳、大泻、大汗、大病之后，皆能令人口淡无味，亦岂皆胃火使然耶？故凡临此者，但察其别无火证火脉，则不宜以劳伤作内热而妄用寒凉也。<a id="orig-32p" href="#trans-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>　　　　　臭气</p>

<p><strong>Lips and Mouth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi’s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treatise on the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>The center is yellow, connected to the spleen, opening at the mouth, and storing essence in the spleen.  [Note: The center is the position of earth, the spleen is the earth organ, and its qi is interconnected. Yellow is the color of earth, and the mouth is the orifice of the spleen.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Correspondence of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>The center generates dampness, dampness produces earth, earth generates sweetness, sweetness nourishes the spleen, the spleen generates flesh, flesh generates the lungs, and the spleen connects to the mouth, which is the orifice.  [Note: The qi of the spleen is connected to the mouth, and when the spleen is harmonious, it can discern the flavors of grains, hence the spleen governs the mouth. The spleen serves to welcome nourishment, which is why its orifice is at the mouth.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Six Energetic Organs</strong></p>
<p>The spleen, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, three burners, and bladder are the foundation of the granary and the residence of nourishment, referred to as vessels. Their manifestation can be seen in the white flesh of the four corners of the lips.  [Note: The spleen receives food and water as a transport official, the intestines receive and transmit food and water, the three burners regulate the water pathways, the bladder is the organ of water essence, thus they are the foundation of the granary. The spleen houses nourishment, thus it is called the residence of nourishment. The spleen possesses the qi of raising, lowering, entering, and exiting, hence it is termed a vessel. The four whites refer to the white flesh at the four edges of the lips. The mouth is the orifice of the spleen and governs the flesh, hence the manifestation is found in the white flesh of the lips.]<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The Yangming channel indicates the end, with movements of the mouth and eyes, leading to excessive surprise and vain talk, and a yellow complexion. If there is a lack of benevolence above and below, it is the end.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Heat</h3>
<p>In five days, the Shaoyin suffers. The Shaoyin pulse connects to the kidney, branches to the lung, and is linked at the base of the tongue, causing dryness in the mouth and tongue and thirst. On the eleventh day, the Shaoyin disease weakens, thirst ceases, there is no fullness, and the tongue is dry followed by sneezing. </p>
<p>The six energies interact; though they enter into the yin within, they all manifest as heat symptoms, hence the dryness and thirst. As the pathogenic qi gradually weakens, the righteous qi begins to recover, thus thirst ceases. Those affected by cold on both sides suffer; if it lasts one day, both the Juyin and Shaoyin are affected, resulting in headaches, dry mouth, and fullness.</p>
<p>This also discusses the dual effects of yin and yang in disease. The Taiyang and Shaoyin interact as exterior and interior; if both are afflicted simultaneously, it results in Taiyang headaches and Shaoyin&#39;s fullness and dry mouth.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Qi Blocking</h3>
<p>Heat from the bladder moves to the small intestine, causing hindered bowel movements, resulting in oral ulcers. </p>
<p>The pulse of the small intestine connects to the heart, following the throat down to the bladder, as it pertains to the small intestine. The lower part of the small intestine is called the “gate of the ileum,” which separates and filters fluids, seeping into the bladder. Heat transferred back from the bladder to the small intestine causes the intestines to fail to descend. The damp heat qi adversely reverses along the channel, leading to ulceration of the mouth.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Wind</h3>
<p>The injuries caused by wind, particularly in summer, lead to what is called &quot;heart wind.&quot; The symptoms of heart wind include excessive sweating, aversion to wind, dryness and burning sensations, propensity for anger and fright, and a red complexion. In severe cases, speech becomes difficult. Diagnosis reveals a red color in the mouth. <strong>[Note: The heart is associated with the fire organ; when wind is excessive, fire becomes intense, resulting in dry and cracked lips with a deficiency of moisture. Wind transforms wood, and the conflict of wood and fire leads to easy anger and fear. The heart governs the tongue; if the condition worsens, the tongue becomes strong but speech becomes difficult. When the heart is harmonious, the tongue can discern the five flavors, hence the diagnosis involves the mouth.]</strong></p>
<p>When wind enters the interior for a long time, it causes intestinal wind leading to diarrhea. If it affects the skin&#39;s surface, it results in &quot;leakage wind.&quot; The symptoms of leakage wind include heavy sweating, with sweat soaking through clothing, and dryness in the mouth. When the wind pools above, it impedes effort, and if the body is in pain, it is accompanied by coldness. <strong>[Note: The qi of the spleen and stomach governs the muscles externally and the abdomen internally. If the wind pathogen remains in the muscles and enters the interior, it injures the qi of the spleen and stomach, resulting in intestinal wind and diarrhea. The large and small intestines both belong to the stomach. If it remains long in the exterior muscles, the yang qi disperses outward, leading to leakage wind. Leakage wind occurs when the skin opens and the qi is harmed, which causes excessive sweating. Sweat leaking onto clothing gradually soaks through, signifying that the source is not closed. The loss of fluids leads to dryness in the mouth. When the wind accumulates above, affecting the upper body, the interplay of wind and dampness harms the yang qi, leading to inability to exert oneself. If one tends to labor excessively, the body will be in pain and feel cold.]</strong><a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Atrophy</strong></p>
<p>When the liver qi is hot, it leads to bile leakage, a bitter mouth, and dryness in the sinews and membranes. When the sinews and membranes are dry, the muscles become tense and spasm, resulting in muscular atrophy. [Note: The gallbladder is an organ that stores essence and corresponds to the sinews. The sinews throughout the body are nourished by the essence contained in the gallbladder. When the gallbladder is attached to the liver, if the liver qi is hot, bile leaks out causing a bitter mouth; when bile leaks, the sinews and membranes lack nourishment and become dry, leading to tension and spasm that result in atrophy.]</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Syncope</strong></p>
<p>When there is syncope in the lesser yin, it results in dry mouth, red urine, abdominal distension, and heart pain. [Note: The foot lesser yin pulse belongs to the kidneys, connects with the bladder, passes through the liver diaphragm, enters the lungs, exits to connect with the heart, travels through the throat, and underlies the root of the tongue. When the meridians are reversed, the yin fluids cannot ascend, hence the dry mouth and heart pain. The lung metal cannot regulate the lower part, leading to red urine. When the energies of water and fire, yin and yang do not interact, it results in abdominal distension.]</p>

The fluid in the spleen causes the mouth to taste sweet. This is produced by rich and fatty foods. Such a person must often consume sweet and rich food, which leads to internal heat, and the sweetness causes fullness, resulting in an overflow of qi that transforms into thirst. Treat it with orchids to eliminate the accumulated old qi.</p>
<p>[Note: The five qi refers to earth qi, which is central; in number it is five, in flavor it is sweet, in odor it is fragrant, in organ it is the spleen, and in orifice it is the mouth. Eating too much sweet and rich food leaves foul odors in the spleen, causing the spleen qi to overflow and manifest externally. Rich flavors generate internal heat, and sweetness tends to linger. The spleen is responsible for transporting fluid from the stomach. When the five flavors are consumed, the fluids each follow their path; sweetness reaches the spleen first, and consuming rich sweet food often leads to internal heat retention. Fluids cannot be distributed among the five organs and remain isolated in the spleen. When spleen qi overflows, it causes the mouth to taste sweet. Treat it with orchids to eliminate the accumulated old qi.]</p>

<p>The chronicle of preparation for transformation is centered around the mouth.<br>(Note: Preparation for transformation refers to the earth&#39;s governance; earth corresponds to the spleen, and the spleen opens to the mouth.) The wind of the extreme yin descends from the heavens; the energy of the spleen rises, as the earth flourishes and yellow sprouts. When water becomes obstructed, the earth must undergo transformation, experiencing heaviness while the muscles atrophy and the appetite diminishes, leading to a dry mouth.<br>(Note: The chronicle of earth concerns matters related to earth itself, its organ is the spleen, and its color is yellow. The flourishing earth indicates that the earth&#39;s essence is abundant below. The yellow sprouting refers to the earth’s energy rising to the heavens. Since earth transforms under the influence of wood, it is subjected to its overcoming power, resulting in the earth changing and causing spleen ailments characterized by heaviness and decreased appetite.)</p>

<p>(Note: The Stomach is the sea of food and drink and governs the generation of nutritive blood. Therefore, it governs blood-related diseases, leading to conditions like mania and intermittent fever with sweating due to the heat of stomach qi evaporating fluids. Nasal bleeding is due to the heat in the meridians. Crooked mouth and swollen lips indicate diseases of the Yangming channel.)</p>
<p>If the Qi of the Foot Taiyin is exhausted, the pulse will not nourish the muscles. The shoulder and tongue are foundational to the muscles. If the pulse does not nourish, the muscles will be weak; if the muscles are weak, they will atrophy, leading to fullness in the Ren Zhong point. If the Ren Zhong point is full, the lips will invert; if the lips invert, it means the flesh has begun to perish. If the first of the wood element (Yin) is strong and the second of the earth element (Yang) is weak, wood prevails over earth.</p>
<p>(Note: The Qi of the Foot Taiyin originates in the Spleen. The Spleen stores the nourishing essence and externally governs muscle. Thus, if the Taiyin Qi is exhausted, the pulse will not nourish the muscles. The Spleen opens to the mouth and governs the reception of food, making the lips and tongue fundamental to muscle. If the pulse does not nourish, the tongue will wither and the lips will invert, indicating that the vital substance of Taiyin has exhausted externally.

<p><strong>The Heat Illness Poem</strong></p>
<p>In the case of heat illness lasting seven or eight days, if the pulse is weak and small, the patient shows blood in urine and dryness in the mouth. They may die in a day and a half; if the pulse is absent, death occurs in a day. </p>
<p><em>Note: Additionally, if the heat does not resolve and it transmits to the lesser yin, it becomes a sign of death. The six meridians circulate; if the illness recurs on the seventh day and does not resolve by the eighth, it is termed a relapse. A weak pulse indicates the lesser yin meridian. The superior to the lesser yin is governed by the sovereign fire. The presence of blood in urine indicates a disease of the lesser yin&#39;s water organ. Dryness in the mouth indicates an issue with the hand&#39;s lesser yin sovereign fire. A person who dies after a day and a half has succumbed within one or two days, marking the end of the interplay of yin and yang water and fire. The pulse originates in the kidney and is governed by the heart; if the pulse is absent, it signifies a cessation below, resulting in death within a day.</em></p>
<p>Heat illness may not reveal where it hurts; the patient may suffer from deafness and cannot recover, with dryness in the mouth. If yang heat is severe while yin has considerable cold, heat resides in the marrow—death is beyond remedy.</p>
<p><em>Note: If the pain of heat illness cannot be located, it indicates external heat has penetrated within. Deafness from inability to recover and dryness in the mouth indicates that kidney heat has risen. Severe yang heat combined with considerable yin cold signifies a struggle between internal heat and external factors. Heat in the marrow indicates internal struggles with external heat.

<p>Cold-induced fevers, when the mouth resembles a fish&#39;s mouth and cannot close, if there is excessive exhalation and no inhalation, it is fatal. If the patient&#39;s mouth is open, they will die within three days.<br><strong>(From &quot;Essentials of the Gold Coffer&quot; by Zhang Ji, Han Dynasty)</strong></p>
<h3>Dry Mouth</h3>
<p>In cases of lung wind, the mouth is dry and wheezing occurs, the body feels heavy and swollen. If the abdomen is full and the mouth and tongue are dry, there is water and gas in the intestines; use Jiāo Lì Huáng Yuán as treatment. If there is thirst for water, dry mouth and tongue, prescribe Bai Hu Jia Ren Shen Tang. In cases of jaundice, with fever, irritability, and chest fullness, dry mouth occurs due to fire damaging the sweat during the onset of the disease, resulting in heat. However, jaundice acquired from dampness leads to full-body heating with a yellow face and fever in the abdomen, the heat is interior, and purging is necessary. If the patient experiences fullness in the chest, with parched lips and a bluish tongue, a dry mouth desiring rinse rather than swallowing, without signs of cold or heat, with a slow and weak pulse, and the abdomen is not full, the patient may complain of fullness due to stagnant blood. If the patient exhibits feverish symptoms, fullness, dry mouth and thirst, yet the pulse shows no heat, this indicates hidden yin, which is stagnant blood and should be purged.<br><strong>(From &quot;Pulse Techniques&quot; by Wang Shuhe, Jin Dynasty)</strong></p>
<h3>Diagnostic Methods</h3>
<p>Left cun pulse is rapid and forceful, indicating heart heat with a bitter mouth. Right cun pulse is floating and rapid, indicating lung heat with a spicy mouth. Left guan pulse is string-like and rapid, suggesting gallbladder deficiency with a bitter mouth; if it is strong, then liver heat with a sour mouth. Right guan pulse that is sinking and solid indicates spleen heat with a sweet mouth; if rapid, it suggests oral ulcers.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Canker Lips</strong></p>
<p>Canker lips refer to a condition that occurs on the lips, resembling a silkworm cocoon, hence the name. The Inner Canon states: &quot;The spleen&#39;s energy opens at the mouth,&quot; and it also says: &quot;The spleen&#39;s nourishment resides in the lips.&quot; However, dryness leads to cracking, heat causes splits, wind results in tremors, and cold may cause peeling. If there is swelling with a white skin that wrinkles and cracks like a cocoon, it is thus named canker lips. It often begins as a small lump, approximately the size of a bean; or it may regenerate, gradually swelling into a larger mass of about an inch thick; or it may develop into various forms like flowers, waxberries, lumps, lingzhi mushrooms, or fungi, with no fixed shape, all arising from the interaction of the six external pathogens and seven emotions. If one&#39;s anxieties and worries are excessive, heart fire can become intense, affecting the spleen channel; or consuming rich wine and heavy flavors can accumulate heat, harming the spleen, leading to the depletion of kidney water. One must carefully assess the causes of the symptoms. Only by replenishing kidney water and nourishing spleen blood will the dryness become moist, the fire diminish, the wind cease, and the swelling resolve. This is a distinct condition, seldom seen, and hard to recognize. If it does not heal after a long time, urgently use heated metal to cauterize it in moxa flames, and internally take the Gui Pi Tang to nourish and restore. This may facilitate healing. However, if one uses external methods to aggressively dissolve the toxins, it may lead to further harm; caution is important! If a woman suffers from this, it is due to a deficiency of Yin blood. It is advisable to treat it with the Si Wu Xiao Yao San.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Diagnosis of Illness</strong></p>
<p>If the spleen and lungs are ill for a long time, they become deficient, leading to pale lips. The spleen is the mother of the lungs; both being deficient cannot nourish each other, hence the term &quot;timid.&quot; The lungs govern the lips; lips that are pale and lustrous indicate good health, while those that are white like withered bones indicate death. If the blood and qi are deficient and timid, and cold invades, the lips may appear blue; a dark forehead and blue lips indicate coldness.</p>

<h3>Differentiating Between Food, Drink, Labor, and Injury</h3>
<p>If injury arises from food, drink, or labor, the symptoms will be evident in the mouth: loss of taste, abdominal discomfort, unwillingness to speak; even when forced to respond, the voice will be weak. There will be excessive saliva in the mouth and clear nasal discharge, which may be intermittent; this indicates a Yin condition. The mouth corresponds to the Earth element; the spleen&#39;s energy connects to it. If food intake is irregular, and injury arises from labor, the mouth cannot discern flavors, nor can it recognize the five tastes. It can also be said that harmful food is evidently the cause of the issue.  </p>
<h3>Oral Ulcer</h3>
<p>The classic states: Heat from the bladder moves to the small intestine, causing discomfort in the diaphragm and intestines, leading to oral ulcers.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Mouth Ulcers</strong></p>
<p>For mouth ulcers that do not heal with cold medicine, it is due to the deficiency of the middle jiao and difficulty in eating, with the fire of the yang rising unrestrained. Use the Li Zhong Decoction. Ginseng, white atractylodes, and licorice can replenish the deficiency of the earth; dry ginger can disperse the fire. If severe, add aconite. It is also effective to suck on fragrant cassia; or grind alum into powder and apply it; or hold it in the mouth and rinse with water repeatedly; for severe cases, drink watermelon juice slowly. In winter, if watermelon is unavailable, use burnt watermelon rind ash; or boil huanglian with good wine and sip it for immediate relief. All mouth and tongue sores arise from heat accumulation in the upper jiao. It is advisable to use Sheng Tang; or sweet tangerine soup with a money of yellow qin, and still combine it with willow flower powder.</p>
<p><strong>Variations in Mouth Tastes: Sour, Bitter, Odorous, Spicy, Salty</strong></p>
<p>Heat in the liver causes a sour taste in the mouth, as wood overcomes the spleen, making the mouth also sour. For this, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction is appropriate, adding gentian root and green peel; if severe, consider Danggui Longhui Pills. Heat in the heart causes bitterness or ulcers in the mouth; for this, use Liangge San or Xiexin Decoction. If heat from the liver transfers to the gallbladder, the mouth will also taste bitter. Use Xiao Chai Hu Decoction, adding stem of wheat, sour jujube seed, root of dilong, and yuan zhi. If sputum is purulent and blood-streaked like a lung abscess, with foul breath, and other treatments are ineffective, use the Xiaofeng San; mix into gray millet with clear rice drink for relief, two doses can clear it. </p>
<p>If heat is in the lungs, the mouth will taste spicy; use sweet tangerine soup or Xie Bai San. If heat is in the kidneys, the mouth will taste salty; use Zhi Shen Wan or Zi Yin Da Bu Wan. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Discussion on Oral Lesions</h3>
<p>According to the theory of reversed conditions: Heat from the bladder transfers to the small intestine, causing discomfort in the diaphragm and intestines, resulting in oral lesions. When the heart and stomach are blocked by heat, food and water do not circulate properly and are transmitted down to the small intestine. The Dan Zhi San disperses heat from the small intestine, while the Wu Ling San drains heat from the bladder; thus, the Dan Zhi San is used in conjunction with the Wu Ling San.<br>— Effective Formulas from Contemporary Physicians [Yuan Dynasty, Wei Yilin]</p>
<h3>When Qi of the Viscera is Deficient, It Reflects in the Mouth</h3>
<p>The taste perceived in the mouth is affected by dominant heat (which presents as bitterness) or dominant cold (which presents as saltiness). Accumulated food leads to sourness, irritability leads to dryness, deficiency presents as blandness, abscesses as sweetness, exhaustion causes bad breath, and stagnation results in sores. The saliva of the mouth connects to the five organs; when the Qi of the organs is dominant, the corresponding tastes manifest in the mouth.<br>— Remarkable Effective Formulas [Ming Dynasty, Fang Xian]</p>
<h3>General Discussion</h3>
<p>The mouth is the channel of the Taiyin meridian, governed by the spleen, and is where the five flavors enter. When flavors are ingested, they are stored in the stomach and spleen, transforming into fluids to nourish the five types of Qi, which correspond to the five organs. When the balance of the five Qi is disrupted, various illnesses arise. For instance, saltiness is associated with cold, sourness with stagnation, dryness with irritability, blandness with deficiency, and heat is related to both bitterness and sweetness. Bad breath indicates dryness and decay in the viscera. Heat accumulates between the chest and diaphragm, resulting in oral manifestations. Oral sores arise from stagnation of spleen Qi, exacerbated by wind and heat. Treatment methods should be adapted according to their causes.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>General Discussion on Oral Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Heat in the spleen leads to a sweet or foul taste in the mouth, and treatment should be with Huang San or San Huang Decoction. If there is heat in the stomach, the mouth may taste sweet; if the stomach is weak, the taste may be bland. Heat in the liver results in a sour taste, and when wood invades the spleen, the mouth also tastes sour. For this, Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with Cao Long Dan and Qing Pi is advisable; in severe cases, Dang Gui Long Hui Pill should be used. Heat in the lungs causes a spicy taste, so Gan Ju Decoction or Xie Bai San is recommended. Heat in the kidneys results in a salty taste, for which Zhi Shen Wan or Zhi Yin Da Bu Wan is suitable. Bad breath indicates stomach heat, where deficiency fire accumulates within the chest, leading to halitosis; in this case, use Xiong Zhi Gao. If the stomach’s yang is injured, the mouth will be tasteless; if the kidney’s yin is deficient, a taste will remain in the mouth.</p>

It is advisable to use salt water for nourishing the Zheng Dan or He Yan Dan. Also, soak the feet in hot water before bed and pan-fry a small pinch of Wu Zhu Yu.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Examination of Medical Formulas</strong> 【Ming Dynasty, Wu Kun】</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Oral Diseases</strong></p>
<p>For sores and ulcers in the mouth, &quot;Kou Mi San&quot; is the primary treatment. Mouth ulcers stem from damp-heat; if damp-heat does not dissipate, it will inevitably lead to decay. Cold can counteract heat, and bitter substances can strengthen the skin. Therefore, we use the powerful properties of Coptis chinensis, Huangbai, and realgar to kill pests and promote circulation; the cooling effects of ice brain deter pests and penetrate the pores; and the bitterness of myrrh disperses blood and heals wounds. </p>
<p>Master Sun, in the &quot;Thousand Gold Formulas,&quot; says: &quot;The root of wild rose is a divine medicine for mouth sores, which people do not know.&quot; Thus, for those with oral issues, using wild rose root is quite common. Now, I have tasted its medicinal aroma, which is harmonious yet bitter. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; states: &quot;Thin qi is the yin within yang,&quot; and further states, &quot;A strong flavor causes leakage.&quot; This clearly indicates that it is a medicine to clear qi and dissipate heat.</p>
<p>According to the theory of qi convulsion: heat from the bladder is transferred to the small intestine, causing discomfort in the diaphragm and leading to mouth ulcers. The decoction of Bupleurum and Rehmannia is prescribed for this. The bladder is the outlet for water, while the small intestine is the region where clear and turbid substances are separated.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the bladder transfers heat to the small intestine, the distinctions between clear and turbid cannot be made, and damp heat cannot be eliminated. This inevitably leads to an upward steaming, causing ulceration and sores in the mouth, resembling meat stew being boiled in a pot. In this formula, Chai Hu is pungent and warm, hence it elevates the clear yang; Di Gu Pi is bitter and cold, therefore it lowers the turbid yin. Once the clear and turbid are delineated, the dry clear and nourishing earth will restore the middle and allow bowel movements to be smooth, healing the mouth&#39;s sores. </p>
<p>For those with solid conditions, add Da Huang and (Shi Bu) Niao. This refers to constipation, where the pathogenic qi is solid. Both yin are obstructed, and the pathway is not open. Thus, Da Huang, being bitter and cold, is used to purge the solid condition, while (Shi Bu) Niao, being salty and cold, softens the hard masses, like drawing out the fire from the stove.</p>
<p>For indecision and weakness in the liver and gallbladder, leading to bitter taste and tongue sores, Yi Dan Tang is indicated. The liver governs deliberation, and the gallbladder governs decision-making. Being overburdened with thoughts leads to qi deficiency. The throat is linked to the gallbladder, and gallbladder bile overflowing into the throat results in a bitter mouth. The wood element can generate fire, leading to tongue sores. </p>
<p>In this formula, Ren Shen and Gan Cao are included to replenish the qi deficiency; Ku Shen and Huang Qin help clear the heat from the qi. The classic states: &quot;When the ruler is clear, the lower will be peaceful.&quot; Therefore, Fu Shen and Yuan Zhi are used to nourish the heart. It also states: &quot;In minor cases treat directly, in severe cases treat indirectly.&quot; Hence, Gui Zhi&#39;s pungent warmth is utilized.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment 【Ming Dynasty, Wang Kentang】</h3>
<h4>Pertaining to the Lips</h4>
<p>The lips belong to the foot Taiyin spleen meridian.<br><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;The Spleen is the root of the granaries, the residence of nourishment; its manifestation is in the lips.&quot; (from the &quot;Suwen&quot;)<br>&quot;The Spleen governs defense, guiding the reception of food, and observing the state of the lips and tongue to discern fortune.&quot; (from the &quot;Lingshu&quot;)<br>Thus, when the lips are well-proportioned, the spleen is balanced; when the lips are unevenly positioned, the spleen is unsteady; if the lips are retracted, the spleen is elevated; if the lower lips are enlarged, the spleen is deficient; firm lips indicate a strong spleen, while large and soft lips suggest a fragile spleen. In cases of spleen disease, the lips turn yellow; in severe spleen dysfunction, the lips swell on all sides. Additionally, &quot;The lips and tongue are the basis of muscle. When the foot Taiyin qi is depleted, the pulse does not nourish the muscles; when the pulse does not nourish, the muscles soften. If the muscles are soft, the tongue atrophies, and the area between the lips fills out; when this area fills, the lips retract, indicating that the flesh is failing. The first element is Wood prevailing over Earth.&quot; </p>
<p>They also belong to the foot Yangming stomach meridian.<br><strong>Note:</strong> &quot;Diseases arising from the foot Yangming manifest as swollen lips.&quot; (from the &quot;Lingshu&quot;) The swelling referred to as &quot;swelling&quot; is blood-related. &quot;Swelling&quot; is an ancient term for lip ulcer.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Qian Zhongyang said: The lungs govern the color white; if the lips are white and moist, it is auspicious, but if they are as pale as withered bones, it indicates death. White lips should be treated by nourishing the spleen and lungs, as the spleen is the mother of the lungs. If both mother and child are deficient and cannot nourish each other, this condition is called &quot;timidity,&quot; thus they should be supplemented. If the color is deep red, then it is necessary to disperse the lung&#39;s excessive heat.</p>
<p>The lips are governed by the Chong and Ren meridians. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;Lingshu&quot; says that the Chong and Ren meridians both originate in the uterus, follow the back, and are the seas of the meridians. The superficial paths circulate around the abdomen, ascending to meet at the throat, branching off to connect with the lips and mouth. Therefore, when vital energy and blood are abundant, the skin and flesh are warm and firm; when blood alone is abundant, it lightly penetrates the skin and produces fine hair. Women experiencing blood loss have excess energy but insufficient blood, leading to the Chong and Ren meridians not nourishing the lips, hence they appear thin. </p>
<p>The upper lip is associated with the Hand Yangming Large Intestine Meridian.<br>The lower lip is associated with the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian.</p>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is governed by the spleen and is interlinked with the stomach and large intestine meridians. </p>
<p><strong>The classics say:</strong> The center is yellow; it connects to the spleen, opens at the mouth, and stores essence in the spleen. Further, it states that the spleen governs the mouth; as an organ, it is the spleen, and as an orifice, it is the mouth. Again, the classic states that the spleen&#39;s energy connects to the mouth; when the spleen is harmonious, the mouth can discern the five flavors. This is how the spleen governs the mouth. Additionally, the classics say that the Stomach&#39;s Foot Yangming Meridian connects below the mouth and meets at the Chengjiang point. And, the Large Intestine&#39;s Hand Yangming Meridian connects at the mouth, meeting at the Renzhong point. This illustrates how the Stomach and Large Intestine meridians intersect at the mouth.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Treatment Methods for Various Symptoms</h3>
<p>When dry, it becomes parched; when hot, it cracks; when windy, it trembles; when cold, it peels. If the lips swell and turn white, and the skin is wrinkled and cracked like a silkworm cocoon, this is termed &quot;cocoon lips.&quot; Some cases have lips swollen like a cocoon, while others have a fine root larger than a cocoon or a lump. This can be caused by emotional disturbances igniting fire and damaging blood, by heart fire affecting the spleen channel, or by excessive flavors accumulating heat and harming the spleen. </p>
<p>The essential point is to assess the primary condition and consider any accompanying issues. Nourishing spleen qi to generate spleen blood will lead to moisture returning and fire being extinguished, causing wind to dissipate and swelling to subside. If the patient neglects this or if the practitioner fails to recognize the situation, recklessly using clearing heat and detoxifying medications, or improperly applying treatment, could lead to exacerbation of symptoms.</p>
<p>For kidney deficiency causing lip cocoons, with occasional bleeding and internal heat leading to dry mouth, phlegm, and weight loss, &quot;Jiyi Yin Dihuang Wan&quot; should be used. </p>
<p>For liver channel heat due to anger, with wind heat affecting the spleen causing swelling and cracking of the lips, &quot;Chai Hu Qing Gan San&quot; should be indicated. </p>
<p>For stomach fire leading to blood dryness, resulting in cracking lips and painful gum ulcers, &quot;Qing Wei San&quot; is appropriate, possibly adding Paeonia and Angelica or Chai Hu to address heat in the spleen, stomach, liver, and gallbladder channels. </p>
<p>If wind heat spreads to the spleen, causing trembling and wrinkling of the lips, along with dizziness or swelling of the limbs resembling wind, &quot;Qiang Huo San&quot; is recommended. </p>
<p>For wind heat stagnating in the spleen channel leading to dry and cracked lips without color, &quot;Xie Huang Yin Zi&quot; should be used. </p>
<p>In cases of damaged central qi causing sores on the lips and mouth, chills and fever, along with a feeling of fatigue, &quot;Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang&quot; is advised. </p>
<p>If worry and overthinking harm the spleen, depleting blood and causing wrinkled lips, &quot;Gui Pi Tang&quot; is appropriate.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mouth Ulcers</p>
<p>Mouth ulcers, also known as heat. The classics state: when the lesser yang governs the heavens, fire energy descends, and lung energy ascends, this leads to mouth ulcers. The second type is cold. The classics say: when the yearly metal does not suffice, the fiery heat progresses, subsequently cold rain violently arrives, the yin is blocked, and the yang rises, resulting in the disease of mouth ulcers.</p>
<p>Someone may ask how mouth ulcers are caused. It is said: the classics explain that the bladder transfers heat to the small intestine, causing the diaphragm and intestines to be obstructed, leading to oral sores. The small intestine is the organ related to the heart; this situation arises due to the influence of evil heat. The heart is associated with the sovereign fire, the main organ among the five viscera and six bowels. Thus, all the heat from the classics corresponds to the heart; the heart&#39;s channels are distributed to the tongue. If heart fire rises excessively and vaporizes in the mouth, it causes sores on the tongue. The spleen&#39;s channels are distributed beneath the tongue; if spleen heat generates phlegm, and heated saliva interacts, rising from the fire, ulcers can also occur, often in greater numbers. </p>
<p>For both conditions, all cold and cool agents can treat them, but if there is saliva, it is necessary to also address the saliva. What then if someone uses a middle-of-the-road decoction with added aconite to treat it? It is said: fire has both deficiency and excess. When there is originally heat in the channels, but it moves excessively, this is called excess; when it moves without heat, this is called deficiency. For excess, the correct treatment is with cold and cool agents; for deficiency, the treatment should be with warmth. The middle-of-the-road decoction is used when the stomach is deficient and the grain is sparse, thereby opposing the counteracting kidney water energy, turning into cold internally.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When the spleen and stomach are weak and their fire is forced to rise, resulting in mouth sores, ginseng, Atractylodes, and licorice are used to nourish the earth, while ginger and Aconite are used to dispel the cold, allowing the fire to receive assistance and retreat. In the &quot;Sheng Ji Zong Lu,&quot; it is said that for a cold deficiency of the original organs that leads to mouth sores, one should use a powder of Ba Jiu, Bai Zhi, and Gao Liang Jiang, along with cooked pig kidney. There are also methods using clove, pepper, pine resin, powdered Xixin, and Su Mu decoction to apply to the sores. For those who cannot eat, angelica, Aconite, and white honey should be sucked and swallowed; some apply fresh Aconite to the soles of the feet, or use powdered Wu Zhu Yu boiled with vinegar to create a paste, mixed with fresh Dihong to apply to the soles of both feet. These methods are all for treating the fire of the dragon. It is due to cold water pressing up that the yang of the heart and lungs cannot descend, hence warm and hot remedies are utilized, either dispersing upward or downward, or benefiting from the yin following the yang.</p>
<p>If there is heat in the stomach and the pulse is strong and large, it is advisable to take Liang Ge San, Gan Ju Tang with three Supplement Pills of Huang Qin, Jin Hua Wan, rinse with Huang Lian Sheng Ma Tang, and apply Lv Pao San or Mi Bo San. Dan Xi recommends slowly drinking watermelon juice; if there is nothing to burn the skin to powder, apply powdered Xixin and Huang Lian mixed into it externally.</p>
<p>According to the Hu family&#39;s prescription, finely grind a weevil and apply it, which is effective immediately. This is deemed the correct remedy for transferring heat from the bladder to the small intestine. The weevil specifically travels to the small intestine and bladder, opening the pathways; it has a potent and strong energy, which may lead to sores from yin deficiency and upward-ascending energy, thus should be avoided unless there is substantial heat in the upper jiao.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

<p>Mouth ulcers can be categorized into deficient fire and excess fire, as well as pale color and red color. Deficient fire appears pale with white spots and fine dots; in severe cases, it shows crack-like patterns resembling turtle shells, with a weak pulse and no thirst. This is caused by excessive worry, with more wakefulness than sleep, leading to the eruption of deficient fire. It is treated with Si Wu Decoction combined with Lian Qiao, Zhimu, Dan Pi, and Rougui to guide the treatment. Externally, it is treated by applying willow flower powder. Excess fire, on the other hand, appears red with deep ulcers in the mouth, and in severe cases, the cheeks and tongue swell, the pulse is full, and there is dry mouth. This is caused by rich foods, thick flavors, and strong alcoholic beverages that provoke the heart fire. It is advisable to use Liangge Powder, and externally apply Fuyan Powder; expelling saliva will lead to improvement.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Complete Book of Jingyue</strong> (Ming, Zhang Jiebin)</p>
<p><strong>The Disease of Thirst and Dryness</strong></p>
<p>There is a significant difference between thirst and dryness, but many people cannot discern this. Thirst arises from an excess of fire and dryness from insufficient fluids. An excess of fire should be treated as real heat; insufficient fluids should be treated as a deficiency of yin. If these two conditions are not distinguished, it is akin to mixing ice and fire. However, although thirst is related to fire, there are several types that should be recognized: for instance, thirst from real heat, which indicates excess fire; and thirst from lacking yin, which indicates insufficient water. Therefore, following a significant loss of fluids due to severe diarrhea, heavy sweating, great exertion, major illness, postpartum blood loss, major boils, and after overeating salty foods, all can lead to thirst. All these cases stem from loss of yin and fluids, resulting in diminished water and dryness, and are not a manifestation of heat, so they should not be misinterpreted as fire symptoms. In summary, if one feels thirsty and likes cold drinks, with a strong pulse that feels bound, this is indeed a sign of fire. If cold drinks lead to stagnation and they prefer hot drinks while having a weak pulse and loose stool, this is not a fire symptom. Furthermore, those with dry mouths may experience bitterness but have no desire for tea or soup; this indicates dryness, not thirst. This particularly pertains to signs of yin deficiency; if one treats this condition as thirst, how can it be without error? Therefore, the method of treatment should focus on clearing heat from the lungs and stomach if fire is prevalent above; and if water is deficient below, one should replenish the spleen and kidneys. If yang is deficient and there is no means for yin to generate, and if qi is deficient and essence cannot transform, then without a harmonious balance of water and fire, what benefit could there be?<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Taste of Bitterness and Sourness</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of a bitter or sour mouth are all attributed to heat in the &quot;Yuan Bing Shi.&quot; It states that liver heat leads to a sour mouth, heart heat to a bitter mouth, spleen heat to a sweet mouth, lung heat to a spicy mouth, and kidney heat to a salty mouth. If the mouth is bland, it is also due to stomach heat. According to this reasoning, all instances of the five tastes in the mouth would belong to heat syndromes, with no possibility of deficiency or cold diseases—could this not be erroneous? For instance, a bitter mouth does not necessarily come solely from heart fire; a bland mouth is not solely caused by stomach heat. In fact, excessive thinking and fatigue, as well as excessive desires, often lead to symptoms of a bitter mouth and dry tongue, with a lack of taste in food. Such issues do not stem from the heart or spleen, but rather from the liver and kidneys. If the heart and spleen are deficient, the liver and gallbladder can overflow with evil and cause bitterness; if the liver and kidneys are deficient, a lack of true yin results in dryness. Similarly, a bland mouth can arise after great labor, severe diarrhea, excessive sweating, or serious illness, which certainly does not mean it is solely due to stomach fire, does it? Therefore, when encountering such cases, one should examine whether there are no other heat syndromes or heat pulses, and it would be inappropriate to hastily assume internal heat caused by overexertion and recklessly use cold treatments.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Foul Breath</strong></p>
<p>Although bad breath is caused by stomach heat, there are also non-heat variations. The foul smell from stomach heat is indeed filthy and often accompanies symptoms like dry mouth and heat in the mouth, as well as other signs of Yangming fire. However, if there are no signs of fire and the smell resembles that of rotten food or sourness, with symptoms like sourness in the stomach and tongue, or food stagnation with belching, it indicates the stench of dampness retaining filth, which is different from the heat-related foulness. This suggests issues related to failure of thoughts and a weakened spleen unable to transform food. Thus, we have one case of Yang syndrome that should clear stomach heat, and another of Yin syndrome that should nourish the heart and spleen. It is incorrect to assume that all foulness must be heat-related, as this could lead to other illnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Presence or Absence of Heat</strong></p>
<p>Diseases of the mouth and tongue can manifest as sores, foulness, dryness, thirst, or a variety of bitter and sour tastes. While many classical texts categorize oral diseases as heat-related, there are also conditions resembling heat but not truly heat-related, as well as fatigue without fire, which cannot all be classified as heat-related.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Mouth Ulcers</p>
<p>Mouth and tongue sores are mostly caused by heat in the upper burner, and treatment should focus on clearing heat. However, if there is excessive fatigue due to alcohol consumption, accompanied by a weak pulse and insufficient central qi, then cold and cooling methods will not be effective. Therefore, after prolonged use of cooling methods without results, one should investigate the underlying causes. An approach may involve tonifying the heart and spleen, nourishing kidney water, using Li Zhong Decoction, or employing honey and prepared Aconite; only then can one achieve complete recovery. This illustrates the need to distinguish between cold and heat.</p>
<p>Treatment Method</p>
<p>For mouth ulcers with a bitter taste, and for symptoms of heat in the three burners, sweet dew drink or Xi Xin drink should be used. In cases of severe heat, Cool the Diaphragm Powder or Yuan Shen Powder should be employed. If there is excess stomach fire, use Bamboo Leaf and Gypsum Decoction or San Huang Pill. For heart and liver fire, use Xie Xin Decoction or Long Dan Xie Gan Decoction. In cases of damp heat from alcohol leading to oral ulcers, Da Duan Qing Drink, Da Fen Qing Drink, or Wu Ling Powder should be prescribed. If there’s damage to the heart and spleen with accompanying fire, Er Yin Decoction or Qing Xin Lotus Seed Drink may be used. If one’s thoughts and plans are frustrated leading to liver and gallbladder deficiency with bitterness in the mouth, Qi Fu Drink, Li Yin Decoction, or Wu Jun Zi Decoction may be administered. If there is excessive fire, herbs like Huang Qin and Long Dan Cao should be added as needed.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mouth Sores</strong></p>
<p>Mouth and tongue sores arise from the accumulation of heart fire. Take three qian of Huanglian and one qian of Changpu, decoct in water and take as a single dose to achieve cure; this is a marvelous formula. The uniqueness of this remedy lies not in Huanglian but in Changpu. Changpu is a medicine that leads to the heart channel. Although Huanglian also enters the heart channel, it inevitably involves the liver and spleen, whereas Changpu solely targets the heart. Furthermore, without being mixed with medicines from other channels, it acts decisively; thus, there is no doubt of its efficacy. This is why it works so effectively. If one does not understand the subtleties of using these herbs and mixes them with liver and spleen medicines, although they may still work, they will ultimately not be as swift as a beating drum. This is yet another method for treating heat. When sores appear on the mouth or tongue, light and clear substances should be used, applying them sparingly will yield immediate effects, similar to the formula of Xiao Chai Hu Decoction. However, many do not understand the balance in this formula; I will refine it further, so it may serve as a lasting model.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

I further add five cents of Ren Shen and two drams of Fu Ling to make it even more extraordinary. When qi is sufficient, evil can easily be expelled, and sweating can easily occur. People in the world see the use of Ren Shen and feel faint, not only do physicians hesitate to use it, but even patients are afraid to take it, leading to a situation where many remain incurable. How can we spread the word to all the doctors in the world to carefully investigate the source of illness and use it wisely?</p>
<p>For those with sores in the mouth, it is due to heat in the heart channel. It is advisable to use cooling herbs like Huang Lian and Huang Qin to disperse the heat, and they will heal naturally. However, currently, there is none used. Use one dram of Huang Bo, one dram of Jiang Can, five cents of scorched Zhi Ke, five cents of honey-fried Gan Cao powder, five cents of mint powder, three grains of Bing Pian, and five cents of Shan Dou Gen, all powdered finely. Soak this mixture, apply three times a day. By the first day, there will be quick relief; by the next day, full recovery. This is a miraculous formula.

<p>When a person experiences extreme heat, their tongue feels like a thorn, and their lips and mouth crack, leading to intense thirst and a call for drink. Although this condition is not caused by a fever, anyone suffering from this illness, even without a fever, will not survive for long. Bai Hu Tang can also provide relief; however, if it is too cold, it may harm the stomach&#39;s energy, often resulting in a reduction of heat that leads to further complications, ultimately resulting in demise. Therefore, Bai Hu Tang should not be used lightly. </p>
<p>I have a remedy called Qing Liang San: two taels of Yuanshen, one tael of Maidong, five qian each of Chamomile and Qinghao, three qian each of White Mustard Seed, Shengdi, and Cheqianzi, all boiled in water for consumption. The brilliance of this formula lies in the fact that Yuanshen serves as the monarch to relieve the fires of the upper jiao; Maidong acts as the minister to resolve the heat in the lungs. Chamomile and Qinghao serve as assistants to eliminate the fire in the stomach. Particularly remarkable are Cheqianzi, White Mustard Seed, and Shengdi as emissaries, either transforming phlegm or cooling the blood, all of which help expel the great heat from below the bladder. This way, the balance between the upper and lower parts of the body remains cool, dispelling heat without harming the stomach. Thus, it can support the critically ill without causing complications.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p>The &quot;Essentials for Preserving Life&quot; states: For dry mouth guiding techniques, rub the soles of both feet 36 times, and synchronize with breathing. When saliva returns, swallow it. This should be practiced six times, along with subsequent exercises. Use your tongue to press against the palate at the Yongchuan point, allowing a flow of cool water, gradually lifting it to your throat. </p>
<p>Another method: Visualize a pool of cool water beneath your throat and mentally lift it into your mouth. You may either press your tongue against the palate or the underside of the palate, allowing saliva to form, or raise either kidney water or Yongchuan water.</p>
<p>If there is heat in the diaphragm causing a dry mouth, push it open at the heart level, visualize kidney water rising to cleanse the heart area without making a sound; or think of the back tongue pressing against the palate, and saliva will naturally form. If you cannot speak, first open the lung meridian, connect the kidney water to wash the heart and lungs, then press on the side of the tongue, allowing the lungs to act like a canopy over the heart. If unable to speak, it is due to an overactive fire causing the lungs to dry out; only kidney water can moisten them.</p>
<p>For tongue poisoning, clear the lung meridian by pressing the tongue against the palate and visualize water washing over the tongue, then exhale the heart&#39;s fire.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Case</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Confucian Family Guidelines&quot; states: A man has been suffering from mouth sores for several years, experiencing pain in his mouth, throat, and stomach. He dares not eat hot food; every time he vomits, has diarrhea, or sweats, he feels weakened. After taking Huanglian Jiedu (a herbal remedy), he began to recover in less than ten days.</p>
<p>Zhao Ping’s family had a man in his twenties suffering from an extremely foul odor coming from his mouth, so much so that relatives would not speak to him. An expert said: “The Metal element of the lungs is responsible for odors, and when Metal is refined by Fire, it leads to a burnt, foul smell. Over time, this can result in decay, which pertains to the Kidneys. When this heat is extreme, it also affects the water metabolism. The disease is in the upper part of the body and should be treated with emetics. First, a tea should be used to prepare to induce vomiting and release seventy percent of the condition. At night, take Zhouche Pills and Jun Chuan Powder to move the bowels five to seven times, and by morning, the foul odor will cease. Alas! Those who suffer from bad breath throughout their lives are mistakenly thought to have a connection between the lungs and stomach, resulting in the odor. This is a fallacious theory.”<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Hygiene Treasure&quot; states: Liang Jimin, who indulged in rich food and excessive drinking, suffered from overthinking, causing harm to the lung&#39;s metal, resulting in foul breath, thick and sticky mucus, discomfort in the throat, and a bitter, dry mouth. This calls for the prescription of the modified Xie Bai San. The &quot;Nanjing&quot; states: the heart governs the five odors, and when entering the lungs, it results in a fishy scent, which is one aspect of it. This is due to the damage caused by excessive heat from consuming large amounts of fluid, which results in heart fire burning the lung metal. Therefore, mulberry bark and earth bone bark, which are slightly bitter and cool, are used to suppress the lurking fire in the lungs, while supplements for Qi are considered primary. Huang Qin and Zhi Mu, which are bitter and cold, treat the fishy odor and clear lung Qi, becoming secondary in function. To help the lungs consolidate, sour foods should be consumed to draw it in, while Shí Wèi Zi, being sour and warm, also helps to consolidate lung Qi. Mai Men Dong, being bitter and cold, treats thick and sticky mucus and a dry, bitter mouth, serving as an assistant. Jie Geng, which is acrid and warm but light and floating, treats phlegm rebellion and benefits the throat.</p>
<p>The &quot;Xue Ji Medical Case&quot; states: The prefect Liu Kexin suffered from chapped lips that occasionally bled, accompanied by internal heat, dry mouth, and thinness, showing signs of kidney deficiency. After using Ji Yin Di Huang Wan for about a year, he recovered.</p>
<p>A Confucian scholar, who fell ill from labor in the heat, developed sores on his lips. Some used Si Wu decoction with Huang Lian and Zhi Mu and recovered.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Confucian scholar Yang Guohua became swollen and painful in the lips and ears due to anger, experiencing chills and fever. I diagnosed the anger as generating heat, which in turn produced wind, and treated him with Chaihu and Shan Zhi powder. After several doses, he recovered.</p>
<p>A man who was prone to anger suffered from swollen lips and, when taking digestive and anti-fire medications, experienced bleeding. He was thin and emaciated. I prescribed a restorative formula (Buzhong Yiqi Tang) with Banxia, Fuling, and Jiegeng added. After a month, the swelling gradually subsided, and his vitality improved. I then adjusted the formula with Siwu decoction, adding Chaihu, fried Shan Zhi, Danpi, Shengma, and licorice in several doses. Finally, I removed the Shan Zhi and added Ren Shen and Bai Zhu, leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>A woman who was emotionally repressed for a long time developed chapped lips. She had mixed treatments that dispelled food and reduced fire, but all signs of deficiency were evident, and she experienced profuse sweating like rain, a condition of Qi and blood deficiency combined with heat. I prescribed the Danggui Liu Huang Decoction, incorporating Huangqin, Lian, and banxiao, cooked black; after two doses, her sweating abruptly stopped. I then gave her Gui Pi Tang and Ba Zhen San together for a gradual recovery of her vitality. Further, I alternated with Xiao Yao San and Gui Pi Tang, taking over a hundred doses until her lips healed.</p>
<p>Another woman, also emotionally troubled for a long time, sometimes experienced stomach discomfort, chest congestion, irregular menstrual cycles, diminished strength and appetite, daily fevers, weariness, and had swollen lips for over a year. I prescribed Gui Pi Tang with fried Huanglian, Shan Zhi added along with a touch of Wuzhuyu; the discomfort and bloating quickly disappeared, but her intake was still low. Then I removed Huanglian and added Beimu and Yuan Zhi, which alleviated her chest congestion, allowing her to eat normally. I further adjusted with an improved version of Xiao Yao San and Gui Pi Tang, alternating over a hundred doses, and after a month her menstrual cycle normalized, and her lips finally healed.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman suffered from a cleft lip and internal heat for two years. Whenever symptoms arose, she took cold and cooling medicines, which caused bleeding and worsened her other symptoms. I treated her with an upgraded version of the Qingwei Powder, and she recovered. Later, after an outburst of anger, her lips swelled, accompanied by cold and heat, and vomiting occurred. I prescribed Xiao Chai Hu Decoction with gardenia fruit, poria, and platycodon, and all her symptoms quickly improved. I then used an enhanced version of the Xiaoyao Powder, resulting in her full recovery.</p>
<p>Another woman, prone to anger, had slight swelling of her lower lip and experienced internal heat and fatigue. I gave her phlegm-dissolving medicine, but she had a reduced appetite, experienced vomiting, and had ineffective bowel movements, with bleeding from her lips. I treated her to regulate qi and eliminate chest stagnation, but she still had dizziness, lip swelling, and irregular menstruation. I then used Qingwei to move blood, which eased her fatigue, reduced fever and restlessness, and caused excessive salivation. I noted that her emotional distress had harmed her liver and spleen, yielding wrong treatment through attack. Therefore, I prescribed Jisheng Guipi Decoction to improve appetite and bowel movements, followed by an enhanced Xiaoyao Powder to relieve swelling and reduce heat. I then used Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction to strengthen her spleen and stop salivation. </p>
<p>Subsequently, due to another angry episode, she developed chills, ear pain, chest fullness, and severe lip swelling, suggesting her anger had ignited liver fire, damaging yin and blood. I prescribed the Four Substances Decoction combined with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction and added gardenia fruit, which quickly alleviated her condition. After another fit of anger, her hypochondriac area and breasts felt swollen, her abdomen hurt, and she had sour vomiting, with no intake of food and difficulty urinating. This indicated anger affecting the liver wood, disrupting the spleen earth. I treated her with Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction, adding chuanxiong and peony, which led to her recovery. However, from overexertion and anger, her appetite waned, she experienced fever and shortness of breath, felt fatigued, had severe blood loss akin to a collapse, and pronounced lip swelling. This reflected liver heat unable to retain blood, and spleen qi deficiency unable to contain blood. I treated her with Zhongyi Yiqi Decoction, enhanced with roasted black gardenia, peony, and moutan, leading to her recovery.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

He was pleased with his strong physique and sought treatment from me. I said: This is a condition of kidney and spleen yin deficiency with excess yang; you need to strengthen the water element. Disbelieving, he took herbs like Erchen and Qinian instead. The next year, his lower lip gradually swelled, and his urination became red and painful. Clinging to the previous medication, his lips bled, his bowel movements became black and blocky, and his urination was dribbling. He asked me to treat him. I said: The black dry stool and dribbling urination indicate liver and kidney failure. The swelling and whiteness of the lips signify spleen deficiency. He refused further treatment and eventually passed away.</p>
<p>A woman had irregular menstruation and hot feet. After a year, her body felt hot, and when tired, her legs ached. After another year, her lips swelled, cracked, and hurt.

<p>Scholar Fei Huaide had a fever with a mouth condition resembling a lack of skin. He was treated with cooling and fire-reducing medicine, displaying a red face and experiencing fever, nausea, and reduced appetite with phlegm. This was due to a deficiency of the spleen and stomach&#39;s cold injury. Treatment with Fu Zi Li Zhong Decoction was given to warm and nourish the spleen and stomach, with the Ba Wei Pills supporting the mingmen fire leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Another scholar experienced a bitter and spicy mouth, indicating lung and liver fire. Initially, treatment with Xiao Chai Hu Decoction plus Shan Zhi, Dan Cao, Fu Ling, and Sang Pi gradually improved his condition. Continued treatment with Liu Jun Zi Decoction augmented with Shan Zhi and Shao Yao led to full recovery.

Occasionally, he experiences a salty taste in his mouth, indicating deficient heat in the kidney meridian; using Liuwei Dihuang Wan can cure it completely.</p>

<p>The &quot;Medical Essentials&quot; states that Xuanwen Bing has incessant drooling, enjoys laughing, and has a dull pulse. Using Lian, Qin, Bo, Zhi, Baizhu, Banxia, bamboo juice, and ginger juice results in the cessation of drooling and laughter within five days.</p>
<p>The &quot;Principles of Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; mentions that Yan Wen Jing, aged over seventy, has not ceased sexual relations. He daily consumes countless warming and nourishing medicines. Additionally, he makes congee with ginseng and soup with Cistanchus, leading to hot stomach, oral ulcers, loose teeth, and foul breath, making it nearly unbearable to approach him. Multiple attempts to use cold, cooling medicines for the stomach have been ineffective. There is a desire to use ginger and cinnamon as adjuncts. Please provide a resolution. I say: Using them will definitely result in serious issues. The main treatment should be an adjusted version of Ganlu Drink in eight doses to restore balance.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a></p></div>
