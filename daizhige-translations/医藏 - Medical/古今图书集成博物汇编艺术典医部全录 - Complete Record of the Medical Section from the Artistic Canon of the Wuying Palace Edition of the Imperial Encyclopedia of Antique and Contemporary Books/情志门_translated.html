<p><strong>On Emotions and Will</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang Correspondences</strong></p>
<p>The heart expresses joy through laughter, reacts to change with worry, and embodies will with happiness. Excessive joy harms the heart, while fear overcomes joy. [Note: Joy from the heart leads to laughter. When the heart is unimpeded, it reacts to change with will; when heart energy converges in the lungs, it causes worry. Happiness embodies harmony and joy in the heart. Excessive joy can injure the heart’s will. When fear overcomes joy, it refers to the will of the kidneys, as water overcomes fire.] The liver expresses anger through shouting, reacts to change with grasping, and embodies will with fury. Anger harms the liver, while sorrow overcomes anger. [Note: The liver, as the general&#39;s office, is thus associated with anger, expressed through shouting. Anger injures the liver when will becomes excessive, harming the body in turn. Sorrow overcomes anger because sorrow relates to the lungs, illustrating emotion overcoming emotion.] The spleen expresses thoughts through singing, reacts to change with hiccups, and embodies will with contemplation. Contemplation harms the spleen, while anger overcomes contemplation.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>The spleen governs movement, thus its intention is in thought, and its expression is as song. Excessive thinking harms the spleen; using intention can then harm qi, and if qi is harmed, the organs are also affected. Anger is related to the liver&#39;s intention, hence it can overcome thought.</p>
<p>The lungs express sound as crying, move as coughing, and their intention is worry. Worry harms the lungs, while joy overcomes worry. The intention of the lungs is sorrow, therefore its expression is crying. When lung qi moves, it reaches the throat and causes coughing. When essence and qi unify in the lungs, it leads to worry. Worry harms the lungs; excessive worry causes damage. Joy disperses qi, thus it can overcome worry.</p>
<p>The kidneys express sound as moaning, move as shivering, and their intention is fear. Fear harms the kidneys, while thought overcomes fear. Kidney qi is deep, thus the sound emerges as a deep sigh or moan. The kidneys store intention and act as a strong official, hence they often harbor fears concerning matters. Fear harms the kidneys; if one is fearful and unable to resolve it, it can damage the essence. Deep thought allows for detailed action, which can therefore overcome fear.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p>
<h3>Secret Classic of Linglan</h3>
<p>The center of the chest (Xuan Zhong) is the official representing the minister; joy and happiness are emitted from there.<br>[Note: The center of the chest is the palace of the heart. The heart encompasses and is situated in the center of the chest, serving the emperor by issuing commands, thus it is the official representing the minister. When the heart is joyful, it acts on behalf of the emperor, hence joy and happiness are emitted from there.]</p>
<h3>True Essence of the Jade Mechanism</h3>
<p>Therefore, if joy is excessive, the kidney energy is activated; if angry, the liver energy is activated; if sad, the lung energy is activated; if fearful, the spleen energy is activated; if worried, the heart energy is activated; this is its principle. Thus, there are five diseases, and five times five equals twenty-five transformations. When they transmit and transform, this is called the transmission of energy.<br>[Note: If joy is excessive, heart energy is depleted, and kidney energy acts on the heart; if angry, liver energy is harmed and lung energy acts on the liver; if pondering, spleen energy is harmed, and liver energy acts on the spleen; if fearful, kidney energy is harmed, and spleen energy acts on the kidney; if worried, lung energy is harmed, and heart energy acts on the lung. If one organ is depleted and receives transmission, it affects the five organs, which have five transformations, thus five times five equals twenty-five transformations. If joy is excessive and kidney energy acts on the heart, the heart transmits to the lung, lung transmits to the liver, liver transmits to the spleen, and spleen transmits to the kidney; this is the transmission and transformation of the five organs, with each overcoming its corresponding counterpart. Therefore, it is said that transmission is the name for the act of riding upon.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Pain</strong></p>
<p>All illnesses arise from emotions. When angry, qi rises; when joyful, qi softens; when sad, qi dissipates; when fearful, qi descends; when cold, qi contracts; when hot, qi leaks; when startled, qi becomes chaotic; when overworked, qi is diminished; when overly contemplative, qi becomes stagnant. Anger causes qi to reverse, and if severe, it can lead to vomiting blood and diarrhea, thus qi rises. Joy harmonizes qi and enhances spirit, leading to a relaxed state, hence qi softens. Sadness causes the heart to be anxious, the lungs to lift, and the upper jiao to be obstructed, preventing the dispersal of nutrients and resulting in stagnant heat within, hence qi dissipates. Fear causes essence to retreat, which can close off the upper jiao, causing qi to revert and the lower jiao to bloat, thus qi does not circulate. Cold closes the pores, leading to stagnation, hence qi contracts. Heat opens the pores, allowing for smooth circulation, resulting in significant sweating, thus qi leaks. Startle leads to a mind without support and a spirit without resting place, causing worries to be unsettled, hence qi becomes chaotic. Overexertion leads to panting and sweating, with both external and internal flow disrupted, thus qi is diminished. Contemplation causes the heart to latch onto thoughts and the spirit to have a resting point, retaining upright qi which does not circulate, hence qi becomes stagnant.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>Note:</strong> Anger pertains to the liver, which stores blood; when angry, the liver qi rises, which can lead to vomiting blood. The wood element affects the spleen, resulting in diarrhea. The spleen is located in the central region, while the liver is situated below; thus, both vomiting blood and diarrhea are manifestations of upward qi. Joy brings harmony and openness to the mind, allowing the qi to flow smoothly and gently. When the heart qi merges with the lungs, it leads to sadness; if heart sadness intensifies, the heart becomes anxious, causing the upper body&#39;s qi to become obstructed and the defensive qi to fail in dispersing. When qi is stagnant internally, it generates heat, and if the middle qi does not circulate, it leads to hidden consumption. Fear damages the kidneys, causing the essence and qi to retreat and fail to ascend. The zhongdan (chest area) serves as the sea of qi, rising from the lungs to control respiration, yet originally derives from the lower region; thus, if essence and qi retreat, the upper region closes, leading to an upward qi being redirected downward, causing distention in the lower area. With no exchange of qi between upper and lower, qi becomes stagnant. When cold qi invades the pores, the pores close and qi does not flow, resulting in internal retention. When heat opens the pores, excessive sweating occurs, causing yang qi to leak outward. Surprise scatters the heart qi, making it feel unanchored; the spirit becomes unsettled with nowhere to return, and thoughts become chaotic, leading to disarray in qi. Overexertion damages kidney qi, causing internal panting, while yang qi expands and sweating occurs externally, leading to imbalance between internal and external forces and dispersing qi. Excessive thinking retains the heart spirit within, causing righteous qi to stagnate and preventing its movement, thus resulting in qi stagnation.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br><strong>On Regulating Menstruation</strong></p>
<p>When the spirit is abundant, laughter is unending; when the spirit is deficient, sadness arises.<br>[Note: Joy is associated with the heart’s will, reflecting as laughter when abundant, while deficiency can lead to excessive metal energy resulting in sadness.] Blood in abundance leads to anger; insufficient blood results in fear.<br>[Note: Anger is associated with the liver’s will; therefore, when blood is abundant, liver energy is strong, causing anger. The will of the kidneys relates to fear; thus, when blood is insufficient, the maternal energy weakens and is shared with the spleen, resulting in fear.] Blood accumulating upward causes distress, while energy accumulating downward leads to increased anger.<br>[Note: Blood accumulating upward makes the pulse strong and the heart distressed; energy&#39;s accumulation downward prevents smooth flow, resulting in excessive anger.]</p>
<p><strong>On Great Oddities</strong></p>
<p>A pulse that feels like flower petals makes one prone to fear; one does not wish to sit, lie down, walk, or stand, and is always listening—this signifies a deficiency in the small intestine’s energy, leading to death in late autumn.<br>[Note: A pulse that feels like flower petals indicates delicacy. The small intestine, as a subsidiary of the heart, belongs to the fire element; its pulse should be robust, but if it feels like flower petals, it means energy is deficient. If the energy of the viscera is insufficient, the energy of the organs is also weak, leaving the spirit vulnerable and fearful, resulting in restlessness. The small intestine&#39;s pulse connects to the ear, which belongs to the sense of hearing; when one always hears sounds like cicadas or bells, it is a sign of deficiency. Death can occur at the time when metal and water flourish.]<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The Yangming (Greater Yang) speaks of severe conditions leading to Qi collapse. The malevolent, akin to fire, upon hearing the sound of wood, startles and trembles. This is because Yang energy and Yin energy are weakened against each other, causing an adverse relation between water and fire, hence the disturbance and fear. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When Yangming Qi collapses, it indicates a disease of the Yangming pulse; evil people relate to fire, and the fear caused by the sound of wood signifies disturbance and alarm.</p>
<p>The Shaoyang (Lesser Yang) refers to insufficient Qi leading to a propensity for anger. When Yang energy is not rectified, it cannot be released. The liver Qi needs to be treated but has not been; thus, it leads to anger. This propensity for anger is referred to as &quot;boiling Qi collapse.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Shaoyang governs Qi. In autumn, as Yang energy decreases and is not expressed outwardly, Shaoyang energy cannot be released, leading to insufficient Qi. The liver Qi connects with the lesser and greater Yang; when Shaoyang energy is not released, liver Qi must be treated but remains unaddressed. The internal stagnation of liver Qi results in anger. &quot;Boiling Qi collapse&quot; represents deep frustration and reversal.</p>
<p>As for the concept of fear, it is akin to being hunted. In autumn, as the Qi diminishes but has not completely vanished, with insufficient Yin and incoming Yang, there is weakened interaction between Yin and Yang, leading to fear.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although Yang energy enters during autumn, Yin energy remains scant, so while all things decline, they have not entirely disappeared. Even with insufficient Yin, it is about to emerge, but when in conflict with the incoming Yang, both Shaoyang and Jueyin energies are harmed, leading to a deficiency in liver Qi and resulting in fear. In gallbladder ailments, the person feels a vague discomfort beneath the heart, as if being hunted.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>On the Seasonal Needle Techniques and Their Reversals</strong></p>
<p>In summer, needling the muscles causes the blood and qi to retreat inward, making one prone to fear.<br>[Note: The summer energy affects the sinews, causing them to swell within the muscles, leading to a deficiency of blood and qi inside. When the Yangming pulse is weak, fear arises, as if one were about to be captured.] </p>
<p>In summer, needling the bones causes the blood and qi to rise inversely, making one prone to anger.<br>[Note: The summer energy is abundant and upward, and its reversal leads to stagnation of qi, making one easily angered.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Meridians</strong></p>
<p>Fear can lead to a downward spiral, causing wheezing related to the liver, while excessive emotional energy damages the spleen. Shock leads to fear, causing wheezing related to the lungs, and excessive emotional energy harms the heart. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Injury leads to damage in the tendons, with the liver governing the tendons, which is why wheezing is associated with the liver. Wood overcomes earth, and thus excessive emotional energy harms the spleen. Shock causes chaotic energy, leading to wheezing from the lungs. The lungs cover the heart, hence excessive emotional energy harms the heart. </p>
<p>When one experiences fear due to running rapidly, sweat emerges from the liver. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Fatigue injures the tendons, thus sweat emerges from the liver.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Energies</strong></p>
<p>The stomach experiences reversed qi, leading to belching and fear. The gallbladder is associated with anger. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The stomach is affected by the cold qi of the lungs, causing a desire for it to be expelled, leading to belching. When the stomach&#39;s reversed qi descends to the kidneys, it results in fear. This is because the kidneys integrate with the stomach&#39;s energies. The gallbladder serves as the central authority, characterized by decisiveness; when ill, its qi becomes stagnated, resulting in anger. </p>
<p>The five essences combine: when essence and qi converge in the heart, it leads to joy; in the lungs, to sadness; in the liver, to worry; in the spleen, to fear; and in the kidneys, to terror, known as the five combinations, which are empty yet interrelated. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The heart is a yang organ; its essence is yin, which causes joy. When the lungs are deficient and the liver energy combines with the lungs, it causes sadness; when the liver is weak and the spleen energy combines with the liver, it leads to worry; when the spleen is deficient and the kidney energy combines with the spleen, it results in fear. A deficiency of yin leads to the influx of yang into yin, causing a weakening of the balance and thus fear. </p>
<p>When yang enters yin, there is tranquility; when yin emerges, there is anger.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>The text discusses the relationship between the &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; aspects of illness in traditional Chinese medicine. It explains that when the evil from the yang enters the yin, the patient becomes tranquil, as an excess of yin leads to stillness. Conversely, when the evil from the yin exits the yang, the patient becomes easily angered, as an excess of yang causes anger.</p>
<p>It describes the five types of evils: spring gaining autumn&#39;s pulse, summer gaining winter&#39;s pulse, late summer gaining spring&#39;s pulse, autumn gaining summer&#39;s pulse, and winter gaining late summer&#39;s pulse. This condition is referred to as &quot;yang emerging from yin,&quot; leading to anger that is hard to treat, indicating an alignment of all five evils and resulting in fatality if untreated.</p>
<p>The text also notes that the characteristics of the seasons—spring representing strings, summer representing hooks, autumn representing fur, and winter representing stones—correspond to the proper qi of the five organs in yin and yang. When the pulse reflects the overcoming of the proper state, it indicates that the evil has become dominant. This imbalance leads to disturbances in the internal organ qi, reflecting on the pulse, thus being named &quot;yang emerging from yin.&quot; When the evil exits through the pulse, it shows an excess of blood, aligning with the saying that &quot;an excess of blood leads to anger.&quot; This imbalance is characterized by the proper qi being overwhelmed by the evil qi, marking it as a condition that is difficult to remedy. The idea of &quot;untreatable&quot; signifies that the pulses indicate a dominance of the evil. If the qi of the five organs is also overtaken by the evil, thus indicating opposing pulses according to the seasons, it indicates a situation that is fatal and untreatable.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Wind</strong></p>
<p>The condition of the heart wind often features excessive sweating and sensitivity to drafts, leading to a scorched feeling, quick to anger and fear, with a reddish color; when the illness is severe, the speech becomes hesitant. Diagnosis occurs in the mouth, where the color appears red. 【Note: The heart is a fire organ; when wind is excessive, the fire becomes rampant, resulting in scorched lips and a lack of bodily fluids. The wind congeals with wood, and the fire in wood becomes intense, which explains the quickness to anger and fright. The heart governs the tongue, so when ill, the tongue appears strong but speech becomes hesitant.】 </p>
<p>The condition of the liver wind often features excessive sweating and sensitivity to drafts, a tendency to weep, and a slightly pale color; the throat is dry and quick to anger, with a periodic dislike for women. Diagnosis occurs under the eyes, where the color appears bluish. 【Note: The liver opens to the eyes and governs weeping, hence the tendency to weep. When wind and wood align as a disturbance, the fire becomes overly intense, which leads to throat dryness and anger due to liver qi illness.】 </p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Illness</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor asked: For someone suffering from anger and madness, where does this illness arise? 【Note: Though the liver transmits smoothly to the heart, it does not receive the right energies to produce life-force, instead succumbing to the cold evils of the liver, which suppress the heart fire, resulting in anger and madness.】 Qi Bo replied: It arises from yang. The Emperor asked: How does yang cause madness? Qi Bo answered: Yang energy, when violently stifled and difficult to release, leads to a propensity for anger; this condition is termed &#39;yang collapse.&#39; 【Note: When liver qi rises against the flow, the yang energy is violently stifled, making it hard to circulate, thus liver qi is also unable to be treated, which results in the propensity for anger.】<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>On the Method of Treating Internal Disorders</strong></p>
<p>For those with liver ailments, pain beneath both ribs radiates to the lower abdomen, leading to irritability. If deficient, one may see nothing with the eyes and hear nothing with the ears, and be filled with fear, as if being hunted. <em>[Note: Deficiency occurs when vital energy is drained. The Shaoyang channel enters the ears, hence the inability to hear. In liver disease, there is a feeling of lightness below the heart, as if being hunted.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On Obstructions</strong></p>
<p>Indulgent emotions and worries cause blockages in the heart. <em>[Note: Indulgent emotions and worries prevent the heart&#39;s energy from consolidating, leading to blockages in the heart.]</em></p>
<p><strong>On Essential Methods of Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>In spring, if acupuncture is applied, at the Autumn Equinox, muscle spasms and reverse qi cause coughing. If the illness does not improve, it leads to bouts of shock and crying. <em>[Note: The disease resides in the liver, which in turn affects the lungs, causing muscle spasms. Blood and qi flow in reverse, causing coughing. Troubled spirits lead to crying.]</em> </p>
<p>In summer, acupuncture during the Winter Solstice does not improve the illness, leading to diminished energy and episodes of anger. <em>[Note: In summer, the yang energy emerges, but it reverses and hides during the Winter Solstice, thus not only does the illness remain, but it also diminishes energy and increases irritability.]</em><a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on the Changes of Qi</h3>
<p>In a year when earth is excessive, rain becomes abundant and causes dampness to flow, the kidney&#39;s water is affected by evils, leading to the people feeling unhappy. (Note: The kidney stores will; if will is not at ease, then unhappiness arises.)<br>In a year when wood is excessive, the result is suddenly heightened anger. (Note: Anger is a disease of the liver&#39;s will.)<br>In a year when earth is insufficient, the people develop a tendency towards anger. (Note: This is a disease caused by wind and wood.)</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Great Principles of Governance</h3>
<p>In the epoch of emergence, the sickness manifests as anger. (Note: Anger is due to excessive liver qi.)<br>In the era of hidden brightness, the sickness manifests as confusion, bewilderment, and sorrow, stemming from the transformation of water. (Note: This indicates insufficient heart spirit.)<br>When the sun governs the heavens, the fire&#39;s qi is elevated, resulting in joy and sorrow. (Note: The heat of fire refines metal.)</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Essential Truths</h3>
<p>When the sun governs the heavens, the people suffer from excessive sorrow. (Note: This is evidence of extreme yang heat within.)<br>In the resurgence of the sun, there is a tendency towards sorrow; if excessive, it penetrates the heart, leading to forgetfulness and heightened sorrow. (Note: This indicates a decline in the energies of wood and fire.)<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p>
<h3>On the Elucidation of Subtlety</h3>
<p>Sadness leads to tears, with tears being the source of moisture. The essence of water is accumulation; it is the ultimate yin. The ultimate yin is the essence of the kidneys. The reason the essence of water does not flow is that it is retained. Wrapped and contained, thus the water does not circulate. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Sadness stirs the heart and will, causing tears to flow, which is the source of water. The essence of water refers to the gathering of the channels, the path of the upper fluid. The essence of the kidney-water, gathered through the channels, rises to connect with the heart externally and flows to the eyes, hence the eyes are where the channels converge. If the will is not sad, then the essence remains below, wrapped and contained, and the water essence does not emerge from the channels, thus it does not flow upward.]</strong></p>
<p>The essence of water is the will, and the essence of fire is the spirit. When water and fire interact, both spirit and will are saddened, hence the moisture in the eyes is produced. Therefore, the saying goes: when the heart is sad, it is called a sad will, as the spirit and essence of the heart converge in the eyes. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The focus of the heart is referred to as the will; it is the unity of heart and will. The heart is the specialized essence of the five organs, thus the essence of water and that of the heart coalesce in the eyes to produce tears.]</strong></p>
<p>Thus, when both are sad, the spirit energy transmits to the heart, but the essence does not ascend to the will, so the will is exclusively sad, resulting in tears being shed. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The essence does not ascend to the will, so the will is exclusively sad, hence tears are shed.]</strong></p>
<p>Tears and weeping relate to the brain. The brain is associated with yin: &quot;Tai Su&quot; (Great Origin) Vol. 29, on water, states it as &quot;yang.&quot; The marrow is the filling of the bones.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>The brain&#39;s seepage manifests as tears. The will (or longing) is the master of the bones; thus, as water flows, tears follow suit, echoing their nature. </p>
<p>The essence of the bones is contained in the marrow, which rises from the bone cavity to connect with the brain; hence, the brain&#39;s seepage results in tears. The will, as the master of the bones, allows for the flow of water, thus tears emerge alongside it. The actions of will and sorrow closely resemble one another, as the essence from the kidneys spills from the eyes to create weeping.</p>
<p>Tears and weeping are akin to brothers; in times of urgency, they both perish, and in times of life, they both thrive together. If one&#39;s will is filled with early sorrow, both tears and weeping emerge and flow together. </p>
<p>When tears and weeping emerge together, it is due to their belonging to the same category associated with the kidneys. </p>
<p>If there are no tears, it signifies that the cry lacks sorrow. When one does not weep, the spirit lacks compassion. Without compassion, the will cannot express sorrow; when Yin and Yang hold each other in balance, how can tears come alone? When the will is sorrowful, the overwhelming emotion pushes against the Yin, which disturbs the will and thus drains the spirit. If the spirit does not guard the essence, it departs from the eyes, leading to the release of tears and weeping.</p>
<p>The balance of Yin and Yang refers to the harmonious interplay of the spirit and will internalized, preventing the essence from leaking out. The overwhelming emotion refers to the will rising to the brain. The eyes are connected to the brain, thus when the will rises and pushes against the Yin, it causes the will to flee toward the eyes; if the will is lost, the spirit cannot guard its essence, leading to a release from the eyes, resulting in weeping.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>Six Principles and the Great Discussion</strong></p>

<p>Thus, anxiety and overthinking injure the spirit; when the spirit is hurt, fear and indulgence become uncontrollable, and deep sorrow leads to exhaustion and loss of life. Joy and happiness cause the spirit to scatter and not settle. Worry and sorrow lead to stagnation and impede the flow of energy. Intense anger results in confusion and inability to manage emotions. Fear causes the spirit to drift and become unsettled.</p>
<p>Anxiety and overthinking harm the heart&#39;s spirit. When the spirit is injured, fear leads to self-loss; it disrupts bodily coherence, causing the hair to dull and complexion to pale, resulting in death in winter.</p>

Cold damages the heart&#39;s fire, while heat damages the yin of the kidneys, making recovery difficult, thus the conditions cannot cease.

When qi rises to the heart, it becomes anxious; when anxious, the lungs rise, which serve as the covering for the heart.

<p><strong>Classic of Internal Medicine</strong> by Hua Tuo (Han Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Desires Lead to Qi Stagnation</strong></p>
<p>Qi stagnation arises from excessive sorrow, joy, anger, and thoughts, resulting in the qi becoming blocked above. If it persists, it harms the lungs; when the lungs are damaged, the vital qi gradually diminishes, allowing the pathogenic qi to dominate. If it remains above, it causes fullness in the chest and abdomen, leading to an inability to eat; if it descends, it results in heaviness in the waist and feet, making movement difficult. If it attacks the left, the left side won&#39;t comply; if it strikes the right, there is numbness on the right; if it pierces the tongue, one cannot speak; if it affects the intestines, one cannot urinate. If it becomes congested and doesn&#39;t disperse, it causes pain; if it flows but does not gather, it causes numbness. When the genuine qi is depleted, treatment becomes difficult. If the pathogenic qi is not overpowering, recovery is easier. The pulse manifests as a deep, slow, and slippery right wrist. It is advisable to moderate worries to nurture qi, exercise caution in anger to preserve the genuine, which is the best approach.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>Fear of Death Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>When the liver is exhausted, sweat flows like water, accompanied by terror and unease; lying down with an ashen face and staring eyes, death occurs within eight days, sometimes referred to as immediate death.

<p><strong>Pulsation Method</strong></p>
<p>The song of the liver states: Against time, it generates anger, while following the pulse, it is long and taut. Tears flow as its liquid; the call is from its homeland. When all three positions feel taut, there is excess in the liver, and there is pain and discomfort in the eyes. Anger fills the chest, always wanting to shout; the vision is dim, and tears flow like pearls.<br><strong>Thousand Golden Prescriptions</strong> (Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao)  </p>
<p><strong>Evil Heat Injuring the Kidneys</strong></p>
<p>A person with a gentle voice may be prone to anger, forgetting joy; in a daze, they may have thoughts. This indicates earth overpowering water, yang striking yin, with yin energy submissive and yang energy rising. When it rises, it causes heat; heat creates fullness, fullness provokes anger, and anger leads to forgetfulness. Hearing becomes unresponsive, the limbs are anxious, urine is red and yellow, the speech moves but does not come forth, one laughs but looks at others; this indicates evil heat injuring the kidneys, and in severe cases, it may be untreatable. If the face appears black and yellow, and the ears do not respond, it can still be treated.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br><strong>On the Origin of Laughter</strong></p>
<p>Laughter is abundant, fresh, and virtuous, flourishing and becoming apparent; it is a transformation of fire, thus it is a manifestation of the heart&#39;s fiery intent. When joy reaches its peak, laughter emerges, akin to a burning flame. The sound of joy is also the symbol of laughter. Therefore, those who laugh due to illness harbor excessive fire. Some may not truly feel joy in their hearts but laugh due to mockery or jest; this is commonly referred to as a cold laugh. When one laughs against their own heart&#39;s sincerity, transgressing moral boundaries, it leads to a sense of shame and loss of resolve. </p>
<p>Moreover, when one lightly touches another&#39;s neck, armpits, abdomen, sides, thighs, calves, or feet, causing them to itch and laugh, this is a disturbance of fiery energy. The transformation of calm, tranquil waters is disrupted, and the skin, which represents fire, visibly reacts. The delicate and hidden aspects pertain to water; if fire disrupts the water&#39;s essence, the person gradually loses their resolve and feels itching, leading them to laugh, as water weakens and fire surges.</p>
<p>If one disturbs themselves but does not laugh, it is due to the absence of shame or itching. Yet, when one feels both ashamed and itchy, it signifies a transformation of the heart&#39;s fire. When a person loses their confidence and feels ashamed, it is because water diminishes and fire intensifies. The relationship between will and confidence relates to the transformation of kidney water. However, those who are itchy but not ashamed, or ashamed but not itchy, cannot laugh, as their subtle transformation is incapable of movement.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p>
<h3>The Origin of Sorrow and Illness</h3>
<p>Sorrow arises from the spirit of the metal element, and metal and wood can cause dryness, transforming into fire. The fire of the heart pertains to heat and joy in pain, hence when one experiences sorrow and anguish, the heart and spirit become disturbed and agitated, rather than clear and tranquil, leading to weeping. When the five bodily fluids are all released, it is due to an extreme excess of fiery heat, which is also countered by the transformation and regulation of water. The five organs are the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, and their corresponding emotions are anger, joy, sorrow (or worry), thought, and fear. When any emotion is excessive, it can injure the corresponding organ. All injuries from the five emotions result in heat. The six desires are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind; the seven emotions are joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, aversion, and desire. When the liver is affected, it relates to fiery heat. The saying goes: the yang is active while yin is still, hence when the form and spirit are overworked, they become restless and agitated; when at peace, they are clear and harmonious. Thus, the highest goodness is like water, while the greatest folly is like fire. The ancient sages said: the six desires and seven emotions are a concern for the Way, and they pertain to fire. Just as a stroke can lead to unevenness and withering, when the heart fire becomes excessively violent and water cannot rein it in, the fire can control metal, and metal cannot control wood, causing the liver wood to become excessive and combined with fiery heat, which can lead to sudden collapse and paralysis, often due to the overindulgence in the five emotions and seven feelings. Similarly, intoxication leads to heat, causing the five emotions and seven feelings to stir up, hence the classics say: tremors, confusion, sorrowful laughter, delirium, singing, and cursing madness are all caused by heat. Therefore, those with extreme heat and madness all bear this symptom.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Rituals of Filial Piety</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty - Zhang Congzheng)</strong>  </p>
<p>The nine atmospheres influence illness and treat each other in succession.</p>
<p>Heaven is illuminated by its essence, and the earth is sustained by its atmosphere. All things flourish between heaven and earth, all born of this essence. When illness arises, it is also derived from this atmosphere. The essence of wind is gentle, opening yet subtle; the essence of heat is warm and comforting; the essence of fire brings extreme heat and encourages action; the essence of moisture is heavy and suffocating; the essence of dryness is clear and harsh; the essence of cold brings winter chill and leads to concealment. These six essences are the regular transformations of nature. When they change, the wind essence may become turbulent and restore great coolness; the heat essence may become overly warm and reverse to cold; the fire essence may bring fierce gales and return frost; the moisture essence may bring sudden thunderstorms and result in violent winds; the dry essence may disperse and create wetness; the cold essence may bring snow, frost, and hail and result in white dust. This is the transformation of the six essences. Therefore, if heaven is persistently cold, one regulates it with warmth; if heaven is persistently cool, one regulates it with heat; if heaven is persistently dark, one regulates it with light; if heaven is persistently clear, one regulates it with rain. The essences of heaven and earth remain stable in normalcy but become illnesses in change. Furthermore, humans receive the essences of heaven and earth, with the five movements repeatedly invading from outside and the seven emotions battling within; thus, the wise cherish the essence as one would a precious treasure, while the foolish exploit material things and inadvertently harm harmony.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>This text discusses how all pains and diseases arise from &quot;qi&quot; (vital energy), leading to the theory of nine different types of qi. While qi is fundamentally one, it becomes nine due to various influences. The nine types refer to anger, joy, grief, fear, cold, heat, shock, contemplation, and labor.</p>
<p>It states: when angry, qi reverses; if severe, it can lead to vomiting blood and diarrhea, hence qi rises. Wang Taifu said that anger causes yang qi to rise and liver wood to overtake the spleen, explaining the severe symptoms. Joy harmonizes qi and enables the spirit, allowing for smooth circulation of protective qi, thus making qi gentle. Grief causes the heart to become urgent, leading to lung dysfunction and blockage in the upper section, where heat accumulates, causing qi to decrease. Fear results in the retention of essence, closing the upper section and leading to stagnation and swelling in the lower section, preventing qi from flowing. Wang Taifu noted that fear can harm essence, making it unable to descend, and the lower section&#39;s yin qi can also become stagnant, causing swelling. The upper section remains blocked, and the lower section’s qi returns, thus qi does not flow.</p>
<p>The text states: &quot;not flowing&quot; should be interpreted as &quot;descending.&quot; Cold causes the pores to close, leading qi to descend and thus accumulate. Wang Taifu explained that if the body feels cold, the protective qi condenses, resulting in the pores and drainage points tightly closing, preventing qi from circulating, and protective qi gathering internally without dispersing. When it is hot, the pores open, allowing the protective and nourishing qi to circulate freely, leading to substantial sweating and hence the release of qi.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Wang Taifu said: When people are in the sun, they feel comfort; when in the shade, they feel sadness. Therefore, when it is hot, the skin pores open, the nutrients and defenses flow freely, and fluids and sweat are expelled in large quantities. When startled, the heart has no support, the spirit has no place to return, and thoughts are unsettled; thus, the vital energy becomes chaotic. When overworked, there is shortness of breath and sweating, with both internal and external states becoming excessive; thus, the vital energy is depleted. Wang Taifu said: When fatigued and laboring, the vital energy runs swiftly, causing breathlessness; when the vital energy rushes, it manifests externally, leading to sweating; both internal and external exceed their normal limits, thus depleting the energy. When thinking, the heart has something to hold onto, the spirit has a place to return, and正气 (upright energy) remains and does not disperse, hence the energy becomes stagnant. Wang Taifu said: When the heart is focused and not scattered, the energy also remains stationary. This discussion in the &quot;Suwen&quot; on the nine types of qi is very detailed, and its principles are very clear. However, the discussion of diseases caused by the nine types of qi is brief; it only mentions vomiting blood and diarrhea, leaving out the rest. Only the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; discusses illnesses caused by excessive thoughts, sadness, joy, and other emotions, stating: A wise person who nurtures life must follow the four seasons, adapt to cold and heat, harmonize joy and anger, and settle in appropriate places, balancing yin and yang and harmonizing rigidity and softness; thus, evils do not approach, and longevity is achieved. Therefore, excessive anxiety and worry harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear arises and this results in unchecked desires. Because of sorrow, the energetic center becomes depleted, leading to loss of life.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Joyful individuals disperse their spirit and do not conceal it. Those burdened with worry have their energy blocked and do not flow. Those filled with intense anger confuse their spirit and do not heal. Those in fear have their spirit shaken and do not gather. Overthinking and anxiety harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear arises, leading to physical ailments that manifest in deterioration and a faded complexion, resulting in death during winter. </p>
<p>If the spleen is worried and cannot find relief, it damages the will; when the will is harmed, it causes confusion, resulting in weakened limbs, a faded complexion, and death in spring. When the liver feels sorrow, it harms the soul; when the soul is damaged, it leads to wild forgetfulness and lack of clarity. This lack of clarity causes contraction and tightness in the body, leading to weakened limbs, a faded complexion, and death in autumn. </p>
<p>When the lungs experience endless joy, they harm the ethereal soul; when the soul is harmed, it causes madness, leading to a loss of self-awareness, resulting in dry skin, a faded complexion, and death in summer. When the kidneys are filled with anger and do not cease, they harm the will; when the will is damaged, joy turns into forgetfulness of promises, causing the back to become rigid and the body to lose flexibility, resulting in a faded complexion and death in late summer.</p>
<p>Unresolved fear harms the essence; when the essence is damaged, it leads to bone pain and weakness. Thus, the five organs are responsible for storing essence and must not be harmed. If they are harmed, it leads to a loss of balance, causing deficiency; in deficiency, there is no energy, and without energy, there is death. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; discusses the illnesses governed by the spirit, will, soul, essence, and consciousness. However, without the influences of cold, heat, shock, or exhaustion, the conclusions can be inferred and broadened.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>When anger arises, it leads to vomiting blood, diarrhea, convulsions, light-headedness, sunken qi, fullness in the chest with pain in the sides, food causes qi to rebel and not descend, shortness of breath and thirst causing distress, consumption of fluids, obesity, sudden blindness, sudden hearing loss, muscles tense and feel released on the outside, and festering sores. </p>
<p>When joy arises, it leads to endless laughter, hair becoming frizzy, internal illness, inability to retain yang qi, and in severe cases, madness.</p>
<p>When sorrow arises, it leads to contraction of the yin, muscle spasms, paralysis of the muscles, weak pulse, in men it causes blood in urine, in women it causes excess menstrual bleeding, sour nasal sensation, blurred vision, insufficient breath support to sigh, and when crying, arm numbness.</p>
<p>When fear arises, it leads to skin peeling off, aching bones and weakness, sudden green diarrhea, heat and urgency in the face, impotence, and fear causing dislocation of the jaw.</p>
<p>When shock arises, it leads to excessive saliva, unfocused eyes, inability to speak, seizures, loss of consciousness, rigidity and collapsing, and if prolonged, it leads to painful numbness.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>When the energy is disturbed, it can lead to conditions such as choking, shortness of breath, coughing up blood,腰痛, bone atrophy, lung wheezing, bone decay, impotence, spitting blood, dim vision, ear blockage, reduced male vitality, and irregular menstruation in women. If it becomes severe, it can lead to a collapse akin to a ruined city, flowing uncontrollably. When the mind is disturbed, it can cause insomnia, excessive sleepiness, dizziness, obstruction in the three burning spaces (upper, middle, and lower), throat discomfort, gallbladder stagnation with bitter vomiting, weakness in the muscles, excessive sexual fluid, and when gas becomes stagnant, it can feel light and fleeting. Additionally, it can cause an aversion to food. When cold energy disrupts, it leads to clear and cold bodily fluids being excreted from above and below, diarrhea with clear water, vomiting of foul substances, loss of appetite, and severe abdominal distention with urgent pain and congestion, as well as various lumps, hernias, and difficulty in bending or stretching, with symptoms of cold extremities and rigidity. When heat energy disrupts, it causes shortness of breath, acidic vomiting, immediate pressure below, muscle cramps, cloudy urine, a swollen abdomen that makes sounds like a drum, sores, ulcers, and various skin eruptions, as well as vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, swelling in the nose, bleeding, excessive heat or chills in the body, and in severe cases, disorientation, dim vision, ringing or deafness in the ears, anxiety and madness, exclamations of shock, as if one has lost their mind, with energy in reverse rising up, spitting foul fluids, loss of appetite, painful and swollen areas, sudden onset of serious illness, and death. </p>
<p>All nine of these conditions can be treated as per the principles outlined in the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; specifically by applying the methods of the five elements in a mutually restraining approach. Anger damages the liver which belongs to wood; when one is angry, the energy congregates in the liver, and the spleen, associated with earth, becomes affected; if wood becomes excessive, the liver will also suffer.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>Joy harms the heart, while the heart is associated with fire. When joy is excessive, the qi converges in the heart, causing the lungs (metal) to suffer from affliction; if fire is too strong, the heart will also be ill. Grief harms the lungs, which are associated with metal. When grief is excessive, the qi converges in the lungs, causing the liver (wood) to suffer from affliction; if metal is too strong, the lungs will also be ill. Fear harms the kidneys, which are associated with water. When fear is excessive, the qi converges in the kidneys, causing the heart (fire) to suffer from affliction; if water is too strong, the kidneys will also be ill. Thinking harms the spleen, which is associated with earth. When thought is excessive, the qi converges in the spleen, causing the kidneys (water) to suffer from affliction; if earth is too strong, the spleen will also be ill. Cold harms the body, which is associated with yin. When cold overcomes heat, yang suffers illness; if cold is too strong, yin will also be ill. Heat harms the qi, which is associated with yang. When heat overcomes cold, yin suffers illness; if heat is too strong, yang will also be ill.</p>
<p>All of these seven factors affect each other. Therefore, grief can remedy anger by moving it with words of compassion and distress; joy can remedy grief by entertaining it with playful and frivolous words; fear can remedy joy by daunting it with urgent words of impending death; anger can remedy thought by provoking it with words of insult and deceit; thought can remedy fear by removing it with words that consider the intentions of others. All five of these methods must be devious and peculiar, employing whatever means necessary to move people&#39;s hearts and eyes, making it easier to influence their sight and hearing. However, if a person lacks the tools and resources within them, they cannot employ these five methods.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br>Jiong can treat cold. For cold outside, use a heated needle (fire) to cauterize and induce sweating; for cold inside, balance it with warm food and warming medicines. Cold can also treat jiong. For jiong outside, use a cool room, a chilly bed, and light clothing to induce sweating with cooling medicines; for jiong inside, balance it with cold drinks and cold medicines. Only rest can treat fatigue, as the classics say, fatigue should be warmed, which means to care for and nurture it. Modern doctors have a far-off understanding, treating warmth as simply a warming medicine. Qi Bo said: to balance is to rest as well. Only habituation can treat fright, as the classics say, fright should be balanced, referring to stability. Fright comes unexpectedly, but if one becomes accustomed to seeing and hearing, one will not be startled. These nine principles are from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; inherently rational, yet inept craftsmen abandon them. In the present day, Liu Hejian interprets the five emotions, uniquely grasping the deeper meaning, stating that the five emotions arise from the heart; thus, the signs of joy, anger, sorrow, fear, and thought are all centered on balancing heartfire. Furthermore, fatigue is caused by movement, and movement belongs to yang; fright stems from the heart, and the heart belongs to fire. Both of these are also centered on balancing the heart. Modern doctors do not grasp this intention, leading to misunderstandings about coldness, which proliferate noisily. Scholars and officials are confused by it—when will public opinion solidify?<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>Introduction to Medicine</strong><br><strong>[Ming Dynasty - Li Chan]</strong></p>

Fear is, therefore, the emotional state associated with the kidneys. The discussion regarding other organs in the following sections also links back to the kidneys. The liver stores blood; when blood is insufficient, there is fear. The liver is the child of the kidneys. When water is abundant, the gallbladder is strong; when water is lacking, blood becomes deficient, causing fear. The stomach is also related to fear—the stomach belongs to earth, while the kidneys belong to water. When earth harms water, fear arises. The heart, when troubled by anxiety and thinking, harms the spirit. When the spirit is harmed, fear and loss of composure follow. The heart houses the spirit; when the spirit is hurt, the heart becomes timid, leading to fear and loss of composure, akin to fire being fearful of water. </p>
<p>In examining the classics, fear is associated with the kidneys, liver, heart, and stomach. The liver and gallbladder are linked to the kidneys, sharing the same source; the stomach in relation to the kidneys is something that cannot be surpassed; and the heart in relation to the kidneys is fearful of being overpowered. Hence, the phenomenon of fear is fundamentally tied to the kidneys, while also involving other organs; thus, treatment methods differ accordingly. For kidney injuries, one should adopt nourishing flavors, using herbs like goji berries, polygala root, rehmannia root, cornelian cherry, poria, achyranthes, and eucommia bark. For liver and gallbladder nourishing, one should focus on nourishing yin with herbs such as sour jujube seed, cornelian cherry, peony root, white peony, licorice, and dragon&#39;s teeth. For treating the Yangming system, one needs to boost vitality, using a modified Four Gentlemen Decoction with increased poria. To stabilize the heart, one should calm the spirit with herbs like cinnabar, amber, gold and silver leaf, rhinoceros horn, and dragon&#39;s teeth.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>Medical Laws of the Physician</strong><br><strong>By Yu Chang, Qing Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart as the Master of the Organs</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Essence of the Heart&quot; says: When the heart is anxious and overthinks, it injures the spirit; if the spirit is harmed, fear and confusion arise. The passage on &quot;Evil Qi and Organ Afflictions&quot; states: Worry and fear injure the heart. The &quot;Inquiry on the Mouth&quot; notes: Sadness and worry disturb the heart, which in turn causes all the five viscera and six bowels to be shaken. It is evident that the heart is the great master of the five viscera and six bowels, presiding over the soul and spirit, and encompassing intention and will. Therefore, when worry arises in the heart, the lungs respond; when thoughts arise in the heart, the spleen responds; when anger arises in the heart, the liver responds; when fear arises in the heart, the kidneys respond. This illustrates how the five emotions are directed by the heart. If one can nurture this heart well, dwell in tranquility, remain untroubled by fear or overly joyful, gracefully adapt to circumstances without contention, and change with time without a strong sense of self, then intention and will are harmonious, the spirit is settled, regret and anger do not arise, the soul remains intact, and the five viscera are at peace. Thus, what can evil do to me?<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method for Liver Injury Due to Anger</strong>  </p>
<p>When a person feels gloomy and unhappy, and suddenly suffers from a blockage of energy that prevents them from speaking, if not treated properly, they may die. Gloom has always inflicted harm on the liver; can one injure the liver further? Injuring the liver only exacerbates the gloom, which cannot be alleviated. How then can one save a life in an instant?  </p>
<p>The formula to rescue the liver and open up the gloom consists of:<br>Two taels of White Peony Root,<br>One qian each of Bupleurum and Licorice,<br>Three qians of White Mustard Seed,<br>Five qians each of Atractylodes, Poria, and Angelica,<br>Two qians of Dried Tangerine Peel,<br>Boil with water and take orally.  </p>
<p>One dose will restore the voice, the second will calm the spirit, and the third will completely resolve the stagnant energy. The brilliance of this formula lies in the use of a maximum of two taels of White Peony Root, which directly enters the liver channel to replenish its deficient energy, naturally allowing the blood to be generated and the fire to be extinguished. Additionally, the use of Atractylodes and Angelica nourishes the earth to produce blood, Bupleurum alleviates stagnation, Licorice harmonizes the center, and White Mustard Seed dissolves phlegm obstructing the diaphragm. Furthermore, the heavy use of Poria ensures that stagnant energy and phlegm are entirely absorbed into the bladder and dissipated without a trace.  </p>
<p>If a person has unresolved stagnation and appears wan and emaciated, they must be treated urgently with this formula, lest they undergo unforeseen transformations!<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br><strong>Treatment for Timidity</strong></p>
<p>When a person is timid and dares not face others, it is due to the deficiency of the lesser yang gallbladder meridian. The cause of this deficiency in the lesser yang gallbladder meridian is the weakness of the liver wood. Furthermore, the weakness of the liver wood results from the insufficient water of the kidneys. The treatment should therefore focus on nourishing the kidneys to promote the growth of the liver wood. </p>
<p>For this, use one ounce of cooked rehmannia, four taels of mountain cornel, five taels each of peony, angelica, and poria, and one tael each of bupleurum, white mustard seed, jujube seeds, and cinnamon. Prepare this as a decoction to take. </p>
<p>The effectiveness of this formula lies in its ability to nourish the kidneys while also replenishing the liver. It is particularly ingenious to omit anything that nourishes the heart, ensuring that the heart does not draw blood from the liver and gallbladder. This way, the bile can become abundant and the timidity can be alleviated. Additionally, using cinnamon to enter the liver is brilliant, as it instills courage, making the timid naturally bold. </p>
<p>This treatment has profound principles. Does anyone know of it?<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br><strong>Formula for Heart Supplementation</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: When the liver is weak, the eyes can see nothing, and the ears can hear nothing; one feels great fear, as if one were about to be captured. Treat using the channels of the Jueyin and Shaoyang. When the kidneys are weak, there is pain in the chest and pain in the abdomen, both upper and lower; there is a feeling of emptiness, and one is not happy. Treat using the channels of the Shaoyin and Taiyang to access the blood. The Yangming channel causes pain in the lower back, making it impossible to turn; if one turns, it feels as if there is something visible, leading to a feeling of sorrow. Acupuncture on the Yangming channel at three points before the knee and harmonizing above and below will cause bleeding; in autumn, it does not bleed. The Jie Mai channel causes lower back pain as if pulled by a strap, often in a bent-over posture, leading to great fear. Acupuncture on the Jie Mai at the Xie point will cause blood to flow, shooting out like millet; bleeding will show red blood only. </p>
<p>The Feiyang channel causes lower back pain, with a sensation of heaviness that may lead to sorrow and fear. Acupuncture on the Feiyang channel located five &quot;cuns&quot; above the inner ankle, in front of the Shaoyin and where it meets the Yinwei, is beneficial. If someone experiences a fall, with evil blood retained internally, causing abdominal distention and an inability to move forward or backward, one should first drink a laxative. This affects the upper channel of Jueyin and the lower channel of Shaoyin. Acupuncture below the inner ankle in front of the Yangu will cause blood to flow, and acupuncture on the proximal artery of the foot will require several needles; if not effective, needle three points on the upper foot to encourage blood flow, showing blood immediately. Needle on the left for the right side, and on the right for the left. If one is sorrowful, startled, or unhappy, needle as if aiming to the right. </p>
<p>When evil enters the channels of the foot&#39;s Shaoyin, it causes throat pain and an inability to eat, alongside unreasonable anger with Qi rising to the upper regions. Needle the central meridian below the foot three times each side, totaling six needle points for immediate relief. Needle on the left for the right side, and on the right for the left.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; states: Those suffering from gallbladder illness often sigh deeply, have a bitter taste in the mouth, and may vomit residual juices. They feel a slight discomfort in the heart area, fear being caught by others, and experience a gurgling sensation in the throat with frequent spitting. For issues at the root of the lesser yang, one should also examine the pulse for any sinking sensations and perform moxibustion. For cold and heat, treat at Yanglingquan.</p>
<p>Those who are easily angered and have no desire to eat tend to speak less; treat at the foot of the greater yin. If anger leads to excessive talking, needle the lesser yang on the foot. </p>
<p>The Jueyin relates to closure; if it withdraws, the flow of energy is cut off, leading to feelings of joy and sorrow. For sorrowful feelings, treat the Jueyin while observing any excess or deficiency. If the evil suffers in the heart, it leads to heartache, emotional fluctuations, and periods of dizziness or fainting; assess any excess or deficiency accordingly for treatment.</p>
<p>In cases of head pain and headache pulses, with feelings of sorrow, joy, and tears, treat the overflowing in the head arteries by draining blood, and subsequently adjust the foot at the Jueyin.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes a person to grieve and shed tears? Qibo replied: The heart is the master of the five viscera and six bowels. The eyes are where the primary vessels converge and are the path for ascending fluids. The mouth and nose are the gateways of breath. Therefore, when sad, grieved, or anxious, the heart is moved; when the heart moves, all the five viscera and six bowels are shaken; when shaken, the primary vessels are affected; when affected, the fluid pathways open; thus, tears flow. The fluids are what nourish and moisten the empty orifices, so when the path for ascending fluids is open, tears flow; if tears flow continuously, the fluids become depleted; when the fluids are depleted, essence cannot be nourished; when essence is not nourished, the eyes can see nothing. Hence it is termed the loss of essence, and the treatment involves supplementing the Tianshu channel along the neck.</p>
<p>The &quot;Classic of Difficulties&quot; states: Shortness of breath and heart block, sadness and anger reversing the qi, sudden impulse of anger, are governed by the fish border (the acupoint). </p>
<p>Heart pain associated with sadness, reversed qi, a feeling of the heart hanging as if hungry, a heart fluttering and startled, is governed by Daling and Jianshi points. </p>

<p>Neiting governs frequent joy, frequent yawning, and a dislike of hearing others&#39; voices. </p>

<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: Mr. Dai&#39;s younger son, after taking a wife, became increasingly thin and spoke as if from within a jar. This illness is internal. He often twirled his third finger and lost his smile; this indicated heart fire. After about half a year, he drank ice and snow daily and took cool medicines. Mr. Dai said: &quot;Avoid the cold, and you will get better.&quot; His wife feared it was too cold, and Mr. Dai replied: &quot;I use medicine as one would respond to a drum with a clapper; you, my kin, still dislike cool medicine, thus it is no wonder the world slanders me.&quot; By July, he had grown tired of ice and no longer drank it, and his illness gradually diminished.</p>
<p>A certain person fell ill from excessive joy. Mr. Zhuang felt his pulse and rendered him voiceless, pretending to say: &quot;I will fetch medicine now.&quot; A few days passed without his return, and the patient wept, bidding farewell to friends and family, saying: &quot;I have not long to live.&quot; Mr. Zhuang knew he would recover and comforted him. When inquired, Mr. Zhuang referred to the &quot;Suwen,&quot; stating: &quot;Fear overcomes joy.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Dai, traveling through ancient Bo, encountered a woman who laughed incessantly due to her illness for over half a year. All physicians were at a loss. Mr. Dai said: &quot;This is easy to treat.&quot; He took two taels of salt blocks, heated them until red, cooled them down, and ground them finely. He then used a large bowl of river water to boil it until it bubbled three to five times. After it cooled, he administered it in three doses and probed her throat with a hairpin, causing her to expel five liters of hot phlegm. Next, he prescribed a large dose of Huanglian detoxifying decoction, and within a few days, her laughter settled. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: &quot;When the spirit is excessive, laughter does not cease.&quot; This so-called spirit refers to heart fire. When fire receives wind, it forms flames, hence the symbol of laughter. Among the five elements, only fire is associated with laughter.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>A wealthy woman became overly distressed, unable to sleep for two years, with no medicine to cure her. Her husband sought help from a physician named Dai. Dai examined her and said: &quot;Both pulse points are weak; this is a disorder of the spleen, which governs thought.&quot; He advised her husband to provoke her with anger to draw out her emotions, took a great deal of their wealth, drank for several days, and left without providing any treatment. The woman became very angry, perspired, and that night finally fell into a deep sleep. This continued for eight or nine days without waking, after which she began eating again and her pulse returned to normal.</p>
<p>In Luoyang, Sun Boying was wrongfully imprisoned, and his wife and children were also detained. He escaped to a friend&#39;s house and that night felt pain in his stomach and side, asking his friend for medicine. The friend replied: &quot;There is a famous doctor, Zhang Dai, nearby; I will go with you to see him.&quot; At that time, Dai was still recovering from drinking. The friend urgently called him. Dai, seeing through the window that it was Boying, said: &quot;This person is overtaken by great fear.&quot; The friend asked, &quot;How do you know this?&quot; Dai replied: &quot;His face is pale, drained of color; his gallbladder is stricken with fear.&quot; After receiving a pardon, Boying went to inform Dai.</p>
<p>Huo Xiucai&#39;s twelve-year-old son had swelling on one side of his testicles. Dai examined him and said: &quot;This is caused by fear. When fear manifests as illness, it can lead to vomiting blood if it moves upwards, or cause kidney damage and water retention if it moves downwards.&quot; He administered Amber Decoction to help dispel the condition.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A woman, nineteen years old, with an excess of anger, suddenly yelled out one day and nearly fainted. This was due to phlegm obstructing above and fire rising from below. Initially, she was treated with five qian of xiangfu, three qian of sheng gancao, and seven qian of chuanchong, decocted with the urine of a child and ginger juice; she also took a pill made of qingdai and white xiangfu powder, which provided slight relief but did not eliminate the problem. Later, a thorough vomiting was performed and then she stabilized. After the vomiting, a phlegm-dissolving decoction with stir-fried huanglian, xiangfu, and ginger was given, and the Longhui pill was decocted down, leading to her recovery. </p>
<p>A girl, engaged to be married, had her husband away for business for two years without returning; she stopped eating and lay in a stupor, having no other ailments, choosing to lie facing the wall all day. Her father sought the help of Elder Danxi, who diagnosed the situation. After feeling her pulse, the elder stated, &quot;This is due to repressed feelings leading to stagnation of qi. Medicine alone cannot resolve this; she needs joy to relieve it. Otherwise, it will lead to anger.&quot; He then slapped her face, falsely accusing her of infidelity until she became extremely angry and cried out three times. Upon being calmed down, she immediately asked for food. The reason is that sadness depletes qi whereas anger overcomes repressed feelings. The elder told her father, &quot;Although her illness may seem cured, only happiness can truly resolve it.&quot; He then advised that the husband should return. Eventually, this proved effective, and the illness did not recur.</p>
<p>Another woman fell ill without understanding the cause, and when she slightly regained consciousness, she yelled several times before fainting again. Elder Danxi diagnosed her, finding her liver pulse tense, rapid, and slippery, stating, &quot;This is caused by anger; she must have been angered and then consumed strong liquor.&quot; Upon inquiry, it was revealed that she would drink whenever her husband was not around to soothe her feelings. The elder treated her with a formula to dispel phlegm and lower the fire, adding xiangfu to disperse the liver&#39;s stagnation, which led to her immediate recovery.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>A man from Dongyang, Wu Zifang, was fifty years old, stocky and heavy-set, prone to worries and anger. His pulse was consistently deep and sludgy. Since spring, he suffered from phlegm-qi illness, and the physician deemed it a deficiency of cold, thus usually prescribing warming and aromatic dispersing medicines. By April, his legs became weak, qi surged upwards, and his appetite diminished. I said: this is caused by stagnant heat and a deficient spleen, resulting in symptoms of atrophy and coldness. Although he is corpulent and has a deep pulse, this is not a fatal sign. However, the heat evil is too intense; during this fire&#39;s peak, it is really difficult to seek recovery. I prescribed bamboo sap with white atractylodes paste, totaling two pounds. His qi descended and appetite improved, but a month later he broke into a great sweat and died.</p>
<p>A woman over the age of fifteen was energetic and thick in physique. During the hot months, due to a fit of rage, she experienced hiccups, which caused her to jump and move her entire body, becoming dazed and unaware of her surroundings. Upon inquiry, it was discovered she had a sudden illness. Observing her condition, both her form and qi were strong, so I prescribed a decoction of ginseng and reed. After drinking a bowl, she expelled several bowls of stubborn phlegm, broke out in a large sweat, and fell into a deep sleep for a day before recovering. Ginseng enters the hand taiyin channel, nourishing the yin within the yang, while reed greatly drains the yang of the taiyin. The woman, consumed by anger, had qi rising; the liver governs anger. The texts say that anger causes qi to rebel; due to anger, the qi reverses, and the wood of the liver overcomes the fire, oppressing the lungs, hence the severe hiccups and stupor. Ginseng and reed are good for supporting expulsion; with phlegm expelled and qi descending, the fire diminishes, the metal qi restores to its place, and the stomach&#39;s qi harmonizes, leading to resolution. Ephedra induces sweating, while also moderating excessive perspiration. Grains belong to metal; the nature of bran is hot. Wheat belongs to yang; the nature of chaff is cool. The ancients said everything possesses the ultimate principle (taiji). Shouldn&#39;t scholars engage in a comparative study and broaden their understanding from this?<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>Zhou Benxin was sixty years old, in good health, but became greatly frightened. In the first month, he fell ill, unable to find peace, feeling as if he were being hunted. He could not sleep well at night, and felt a burning sensation at the back of his ears. Although he ate and drank, he could not taste anything, his mouth was dry, and he had no desire to eat. Using ginseng, white atractylodes, and angelica as the main ingredients, with tangerine peel as an adjunct, he added a little salt, stir-fried yellow gentian, and roasted ginseng, then boiled the mixture, which cured him. After a month, he found peace.</p>
<p>The &quot;Treatise on Medicine&quot; states: In the village, there was a woman who wept endlessly for no reason. Some said she was afflicted by a spirit. Despite prayers and rituals, there was no response. I suddenly remembered a passage from the &quot;Classic of the Golden Coffer&quot; that mentioned: when a woman&#39;s internal organs are dry and she feels sorrowful, wanting to cry, resembling the behavior of spirits, if she often stretches and yawns, she should take a decoction of sweet wheat and jujubes. I urgently instructed the preparation of the medicine, and upon taking the full dose, she recovered. The ancients had profound insight into diseases and devised remedies in such remarkable ways.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>&quot;The Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: A woman with weak vital energy often experienced phlegm and qi issues, sometimes feeling discomfort in her throat or chest oppression. I believed this was due to stagnation harming the spleen, so I treated her with a modified Gui Pi Decoction, and she recovered. Later, she encountered anger, and her previous symptoms reappeared. Confused by others&#39; opinions, she assumed it was phlegm and wrongly used expectorants, causing repeated vomiting and diarrhea, leading to various new symptoms and a stupor. I thought her spleen and stomach were injured again, so I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang daily, made a strong rice drink for her to take by the spoonful. After four days, she gradually progressed to eating porridge, then took the previous medicine, alternating with Gui Pi Decoction. Pleased with its nourishing effects, after more than two months, all symptoms disappeared.</p>
<p>Another woman suffered from phlegm syncope due to anger, unable to stretch her left arm, with numb fingers, and drooping mouth and eyes. Her phlegm and qi surged upward, her legs felt hot, and she experienced bone pain. She took Wuyao Shunqi San and similar remedies, but her symptoms worsened, often feeling dizzy, with increased internal heat. I believed this was due to blood deficiency in the liver meridian, causing internal heat to generate wind, while the previous medicines further depleted liver blood, worsening the excessive fire. I first used Chai Hu Zhi Zhi San to nourish the qi and blood of the liver meridian. After several days, I employed Ba Zhen Tang with added Diao Teng Gou San, and her symptoms slightly improved. I then used the modified Ba Wei Wan, adding a small amount of wine-fried Huang Lian and Zhi Mu (black variety), and after several doses her symptoms retreated significantly. Finally, I continued using Ba Zhen Tang and Chai Hu Zhi Zhi San, and after half a year, she was healed. However, after labor, she felt a recurrence approaching, so I advised her to take Chai Hu Zhi Zhi San as needed.&quot;<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>The &quot;Examination of Medical Formulas&quot; states: According to the &quot;Records of Observations,&quot; there was a military governor who fell ill due to sorrow. His son sought the help of He Yuyin for treatment. Yuyin told the son, &quot;The method must be applied when his fear is intense, and then he will recover.&quot; At that time, the overseeing official, Li Songqing, was extremely severe, and the military governor was greatly intimidated by him. Yuyin and his son went to request an audience with Songqing to discuss the governor&#39;s errors. The military governor became anxious and broke into a sweat, which led to his eventual recovery. It is evident that when one is troubled, the energy gets trapped; when frightened, the energy becomes unsettled, and when unsettled, the energy cannot be contained. This illustrates the emotional influence on physical health.</p>
<p>Zhao Zhizhe, a person from Taiyuan, developed a disorder due to excessive joy, which astonished the physicians of the Chao clan. They went to fetch medicine but ultimately did not provide any. A few days later, Zhao mournfully told his family, &quot;My time in this world is short.&quot; Chao, knowing he would recover, sent someone to comfort him. When questioned about the reason for his condition, he referenced the &quot;Suwen,&quot; suggesting that fear could surpass joy in response, showing a deep understanding of the underlying principles.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>The Prime Minister Han fell ill, and when the sky showed no sign of rain, ten doctors were of no help. At last, Zuo Youxin arrived, took his pulse, and using his fingers calculated the heavenly stems and earthly branches, declaring: &quot;It will rain on such and such a day.&quot; He then left. Han doubted, wondering if his illness was such that he could not be cured. Why speak of rain when medication had not worked for me? That evening, it indeed rained, and Han was overjoyed, rising to walk in the courtyard until dawn, feeling as if his illness had vanished. He summoned Zuo and asked him. Zuo replied: &quot;Your illness was caused by worry. You have been thinking of your loyalty and kindness towards the people, and during this prolonged drought, it is understandable to be anxious for them. To worry about the drought means you also hope for rain to cure it. Thus, it is only natural, so why wait for medicine to be healed? This is also what the &#39;Suwen&#39; says: joy overcomes worry.&quot;</p>
<p>In a certain county, a dispatcher caught a criminal and brought him to the county, but midway, the criminal jumped into the river and died. The criminal&#39;s family accused the dispatcher of coercing the man to death through threats. The dispatcher might escape punishment but at the cost of his wealth. Overwhelmed with anger and grief, he fell ill, his mind drifting as if he were drunk, speaking nonsense and losing his senses. The local magistrate, Yan Dai, looked upon him with compassion, and Yan remarked: &quot;This illness has resulted from financial loss and will surely be cured by financial gain.&quot; He then ordered three ingots of tin to be made to resemble silver and placed them in a mud ditch, waiting for the right moment. He tricked the dispatcher into mistakenly dropping the keys into the ditch and commanded him to retrieve them, only to bring out the three tin ingots. The magistrate declared: &quot;This is silver, but I will not use this ill-gotten wealth; it must all be given to you.&quot; The dispatcher held it but could not part with it, and gradually, the illness diminished. This too is the principle that joy overcomes worry.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>A woman was very close to her mother; after marrying, her mother passed away, and she could not stop longing for her. Her spirit diminished, and she fell into a lethargy, rejecting all medicines. Her husband called upon Han Shiliang to treat her. Han said, &quot;This illness arises from longing; it is not easily cured by medicine but should be treated with skill.&quot; He then bribed a witch woman and taught her some secret words. One day, the husband said to his wife, &quot;Your longing for your mother is such that you do not know if she remembers you in the ground as well. I will go somewhere else; why don&#39;t you ask the witch woman to divine?&quot; The wife gladly agreed and summoned the witch. After burning incense and paying respects, her mother’s spirit appeared. In every word and silence, she seemed just like she was in life. The daughter wept greatly. The mother reprimanded her, saying, &quot;Do not weep! Your life has caused my death; I died early because of you. My death is all your fault. Now in the underworld, I desire to take revenge on you, and your illness is indeed due to me. When I was alive, I was with you as mother and child; now that I am dead, I am your enemy.&quot; After speaking, the daughter’s expression shifted to great anger, and she scolded, &quot;I am ill because of my mother, yet my mother wishes me harm. What joy is there in thinking of her?&quot; From that moment on, her illness was cured. This was also a healing through emotion.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>Tan Zhi Su was a cautious speaker and served as an assistant in Shaozhou. One day, while at a banquet with his officials, there was a particularly large radish that drew everyone&#39;s admiration. Tan said, &quot;There are radishes as large as a person.&quot; The crowd laughed, thinking his claim was unbelievable. Tan felt regret and blamed himself, saying, &quot;Since people cannot see such a large one, they are right to dismiss my words as nonsense and laugh.&quot; As a result, he became worried and upset, unable to eat for several days. His son, Huang, who was well-read and knowledgeable about matters, remembered how his father rarely spoke lightly. Feeling ashamed, he fell ill and thought that his father&#39;s words must be genuine for him to be healed. He then sent someone to fetch a radish as large as a person and brought it to the official residence, insisting his father, who was unwell, accompany him. When the wine flowed and the radish was presented at the banquet, everyone was astonished, and his father was very happy. The next morning, his illness was cured. This is also reminiscent of the teaching in &quot;Suwen&quot; about joy overcoming sorrow.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>The &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: Wu Tian&#39;s mother often experienced violent anger, which caused her menstrual cycle to stop. Since autumn, she gradually felt an upward reversal of Qi, as if fearing the rocking of a boat, and would immediately feel unwell, spending long periods lying in bed. It was as if the world was turned upside down, making it impossible for her to rise. Various medical treatments proved ineffective, so she began using three to five fen of ginseng, which offered slight relief for a moment. Eventually, she increased the dosage to five qian per dose, spending several golden coins daily, hoping for a quick stabilization to care for her young child. Her family&#39;s wealth was exhausted, her illness grew more critical, and she experienced intense thirst and pain, as if her head were being sliced by a knife. She ate little and had frequent diarrhea; she had treated her liver, but there were no other hopes left. Upon hearing that I returned to Lou Yan for a diagnosis, she entrusted me with her care, believing that I could save her. I explained that extreme anger causes blood to stagnate upwards, preventing Qi from descending; this is called the &quot;Reversal of Qi at the Vertex.&quot; The term &quot;reversal&quot; signifies an upward direction, while &quot;vertex&quot; denotes a high point. When both Qi and blood surge upwards, dizziness and disturbances occur. Furthermore, with excess above and deficiency below, the cause lies in the lesser Yang. The lesser Yang pertains to the Gallbladder meridian of the foot.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>The gallbladder points are all connected to the brain. When the fire of pent-up anger attacks upwards to the brain and receives a supplement, it intensifies, causing pain akin to splitting, which is the same condition as vertigo.

<p>Thus, the intention from the <em>Inner Canon</em> about the &quot;iron ball sinking&quot; is employed, substituting substances like cinnabar, gentian, aloe, and rhubarb to counteract the rebellious qi. With substances such as Chinese lacquer, peony root, and red peony to circulate the blood in the upper stomach; and with oyster shell, dragon bone, and five flavors to stabilize the wandering spirit. </p>
<p>It is crucial to add two doses of fresh pig bile into each prescription, as the heat of the lesser yang will surely dry the bile. Immediately, similar substances need to be supplemented to support and stabilize the patient. When the patient takes one dose of medicine, it is as if their spirit returns to its place, forgetting the bitter taste, and they can take ten or more doses, consuming over twenty doses of pig bile. The heat subsides, the body cools, appetite increases, diarrhea halts, and they can finally rise and move a few steps. However, they still feel light as a leaf and cannot endure for long.</p>
<p>I feared that the bitterness of the medicine might be excessive and not suitable for prolonged use, so I reduced the pig bile and the other herbs, adding one qian of angelica and three fen of ginseng, using ginger and jujube as a guide, adjusting the formula over several days until they were completely cured.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　心在声为笑，在变动为忧，在志为喜。喜伤心，恐胜喜。　　【注　心志喜，故发声为笑。心独无俞，故变动在志，心气并于肺则忧。在志为喜，此心中和乐也。过于喜则心志自伤。恐胜喜者，恐为肾志，水胜火也。】　　肝在声为呼，在变动为握，在志为怒，怒伤肝，悲胜怒。　　 【注　肝者将军之官，故在志为怒，而发声为叫呼也。怒伤肝者，用志太过，则反伤其体矣。悲胜怒者，悲为肺志，以情胜情也。】　　脾在声为歌，在变动为哕，在志为思。思伤脾，怒胜思。<a id="orig-1p" href="#trans-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>　　 【注　脾主运用，故其志在思，发声为歌也。思伤脾者，用志则伤气，气伤则脏伤也。怒为肝志，故能胜思。】　　肺在声为哭，在变动为咳，在志为忧。忧伤肺，喜胜忧。　　 【注　肺志在悲，故发声为哭。脏气变动，则及于喉而为咳也。若精气并于肺则忧。忧伤肺者，过则损也。喜则气散，故能胜忧。】　　肾在声为呻，在变动为栗，在志为恐。恐伤肾，思胜恐。　　 【注　肾气在下，故声欲太息而呻出之。肾藏志而为作强之官，故虑事而时怀恐怖也。恐伤肾者，恐惧而不解则伤精也。思虑深则处事详，故胜恐。】<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>　　　　　灵兰秘典论</p>
<p>　　膻中者，臣使之官，喜乐出焉。<br>　　 【注　膻中者，心主之宫城。心主包络，位居膻中，而代君行令，故为臣使之官。心志喜，心主代君宣布，故喜乐出焉。】<br>　　　　　玉机真脏论</p>
<p>　　因而喜大虚则肾气乘矣，怒则肝气乘矣，悲则肺气乘矣，恐则脾气乘矣，忧则心气乘矣，此其道也。故病有五，五五二十五变。及其传化，传乘之名也。　　 【注　因而喜大则心气虚而肾气乘于心矣，怒则肝气伤而肺气乘于肝，思则脾气伤而肝气乘于脾，恐则肾气伤而脾气乘于肾，忧则肺气伤而心气乘于肺矣。如一脏虚而受乘，即传之五脏，五脏有五变，则五五二十五变矣。如喜大而肾气乘心，心即传肺，肺传肝，肝传脾，脾传肾，是五脏传化，亦各乘其所胜。故曰，传者乘之名也。】<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>　　　　　举痛论</p>

<p>　　脉至如华者，令人善恐，不欲坐卧行立，常听，是小肠气予不足也，季秋而死。　　 【注　脉至如华者，如华之轻微也。小肠为心之腑而属丙火，其脉当来盛，反如华者，气予不足也。腑气不足则脏气亦虚，神虚则恐惧自失，神志不宁，故坐卧不安也。小肠之脉入耳中，属听宫，常有所听者，如耳作蝉鸣，或如钟磬声，皆虚证也。遇金水生旺之时而死。】<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>　　　　　脉解篇</p>
<p>　　阳明所谓甚则厥，恶人与火，闻木音则惕然而惊者，阳气与阴气相薄，水火相恶，故惕然而惊也。　　【注　阳明气厥，则阳明之脉病，乃恶人与火，闻木音则惕然而惊也。】　　少阳所谓少气善怒者，阳气不治，阳气不治则阳气不得出，肝气当治而未得，故善怒。善怒者，名曰煎厥。　　 【注　少阳主气，秋时阳气下降，而不治于外，则少阳之气亦不得出，故少气也。厥阴肝气与少阳标本相合，少阳之气不得出，则肝气当治而亦未得矣。肝气内郁，故善怒。煎厥者，焦烦颠倒也。】　　所谓恐如人将捕之者，秋气万物未有毕去，阴气少，阳气入，阴阳相薄故恐也。　　 【注　秋时阳气虽入，而阴气尚少，故万物虽衰而未尽去。阴气虽少，当正出之时，而与阳气之入相薄，则少阳厥阴之气皆伤，肝气虚则恐。胆病者心下淡淡，如人将捕之。】<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>　　　　　四时刺逆从论</p>
<p>　　夏刺肌肉，血气内却，令人善恐。<br>　　 【注　夏气在孙络，而使之溢于肌中，则血气虚却于内矣。阳明脉虚则恐，如人将捕之。】　　夏刺筋骨，血气上逆，令人善怒。<br>　　 【注　夏气浮长于上，而反逆之使下，则气郁不疏而使人善怒也。】<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>　　　　　经脉别论</p>
<p>　　有所堕恐，喘出于肝，淫气害脾。有所惊恐，喘出于肺，淫气伤心。　　 【注　堕则伤筋，肝主筋，故喘出于肝。木胜土，故淫气害脾。惊则气乱，故喘出于肺。肺者心之盖，故淫气伤心。】　　疾走恐惧，汗出于肝。<br>　　 【注　疲劳伤筋，故汗出于肝。】<br>　　　　　宣明五气论</p>
<p>　　胃为气逆，为哕，为恐。胆为怒。<br>　　 【注　胃受肺之寒气所逆，而欲复出于胃，故为哕。胃之逆气，下并于肾则为恐。盖肾于胃戊癸相合也。胆为中正之官，性秉刚决，病则气郁而为怒。】　　五精所并：精气并于心则喜，并于肺则悲，并于肝则忧，并于脾则畏，并于肾则恐，是谓五并，虚而相并者也。　　 【注　心为阳脏，阴精并之故喜。肺虚而肝气并于肺则悲，肝虚而脾气并于肝则忧，脾虚而肾气并于脾则畏。阴气少，阳气入阴，阴阳相薄故恐也。】　　阳入之阴则静，阴出之阳则怒。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>　　 【注　阳分之邪入阴，则病者静，盖阴盛则静也。阴分之邪出阳，则病者多怒，盖阳盛则怒也。】　　五邪所见：春得秋脉，夏得冬脉，长夏得春脉，秋得夏脉，冬得长夏脉，名曰阴出之阳，病善怒不治，是为五邪皆同，命死不治。　　 【注　春弦夏钩，秋毛冬石，五脏阴阳之正气也。反得所胜之脉者，邪贼盛而见于脉也。在内所伤之脏气，而外见于脉，故名之曰阴出之阳。邪出于脉则血有余，经曰血有余则怒，此正气为邪气所胜，故为不治。所谓不治者，谓五脉皆为邪胜也。如五脏之气为邪所胜，见四时相克之脉，皆为死不治矣。】<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br>　　　　　风论</p>

<p>　　悲，金肺之志，金木能令燥者火也。心火主于热，喜痛，故悲痛苦恼者，心神烦热躁乱而非清净，所以悲哭。而五液俱出者，火热亢极，而反兼水化制之故也。夫五脏者肝心脾肺肾，五脏之志者怒喜悲【一作忧】 　思恐。若志过度则劳伤本脏。凡五志所伤皆热。六欲者，眼耳鼻舌身意；七情者，喜怒哀乐爱恶欲 【一作好爱恶。】 肝之所伤，则皆属火热。所谓阳动阴静，故形神劳则躁不宁，静则清平。是故上善若水，下愚如火。先圣曰：六欲七情，为道之患，属火故也。如中风偏枯者，由心火暴甚，而水衰不能制之，则火能克金，金不能克木则肝木自甚，而兼于火热，则卒暴僵仆，多因五志七情过度而卒病也。又如酒醉而热，则五志七情竞起，故经曰：战栗惊惑、悲笑谵妄、歌唱骂詈、癫狂皆为热。故热甚癫狂者，皆此证也。<a id="orig-26p" href="#trans-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>　　　　儒门事亲 【元　张从政】</p>

<p><strong>On Emotions and Will</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huangdi&#39;s Suwen</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang Correspondences</strong></p>
<p>The heart expresses joy through laughter, reacts to change with worry, and embodies will with happiness. Excessive joy harms the heart, while fear overcomes joy. [Note: Joy from the heart leads to laughter. When the heart is unimpeded, it reacts to change with will; when heart energy converges in the lungs, it causes worry. Happiness embodies harmony and joy in the heart. Excessive joy can injure the heart’s will. When fear overcomes joy, it refers to the will of the kidneys, as water overcomes fire.] The liver expresses anger through shouting, reacts to change with grasping, and embodies will with fury. Anger harms the liver, while sorrow overcomes anger. [Note: The liver, as the general&#39;s office, is thus associated with anger, expressed through shouting. Anger injures the liver when will becomes excessive, harming the body in turn. Sorrow overcomes anger because sorrow relates to the lungs, illustrating emotion overcoming emotion.] The spleen expresses thoughts through singing, reacts to change with hiccups, and embodies will with contemplation. Contemplation harms the spleen, while anger overcomes contemplation.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The spleen governs movement, thus its intention is in thought, and its expression is as song. Excessive thinking harms the spleen; using intention can then harm qi, and if qi is harmed, the organs are also affected. Anger is related to the liver&#39;s intention, hence it can overcome thought.</p>
<p>The lungs express sound as crying, move as coughing, and their intention is worry. Worry harms the lungs, while joy overcomes worry. The intention of the lungs is sorrow, therefore its expression is crying. When lung qi moves, it reaches the throat and causes coughing. When essence and qi unify in the lungs, it leads to worry. Worry harms the lungs; excessive worry causes damage. Joy disperses qi, thus it can overcome worry.</p>
<p>The kidneys express sound as moaning, move as shivering, and their intention is fear. Fear harms the kidneys, while thought overcomes fear. Kidney qi is deep, thus the sound emerges as a deep sigh or moan. The kidneys store intention and act as a strong official, hence they often harbor fears concerning matters. Fear harms the kidneys; if one is fearful and unable to resolve it, it can damage the essence. Deep thought allows for detailed action, which can therefore overcome fear.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Secret Classic of Linglan</h3>
<p>The center of the chest (Xuan Zhong) is the official representing the minister; joy and happiness are emitted from there.<br>[Note: The center of the chest is the palace of the heart. The heart encompasses and is situated in the center of the chest, serving the emperor by issuing commands, thus it is the official representing the minister. When the heart is joyful, it acts on behalf of the emperor, hence joy and happiness are emitted from there.]</p>
<h3>True Essence of the Jade Mechanism</h3>
<p>Therefore, if joy is excessive, the kidney energy is activated; if angry, the liver energy is activated; if sad, the lung energy is activated; if fearful, the spleen energy is activated; if worried, the heart energy is activated; this is its principle. Thus, there are five diseases, and five times five equals twenty-five transformations. When they transmit and transform, this is called the transmission of energy.<br>[Note: If joy is excessive, heart energy is depleted, and kidney energy acts on the heart; if angry, liver energy is harmed and lung energy acts on the liver; if pondering, spleen energy is harmed, and liver energy acts on the spleen; if fearful, kidney energy is harmed, and spleen energy acts on the kidney; if worried, lung energy is harmed, and heart energy acts on the lung. If one organ is depleted and receives transmission, it affects the five organs, which have five transformations, thus five times five equals twenty-five transformations. If joy is excessive and kidney energy acts on the heart, the heart transmits to the lung, lung transmits to the liver, liver transmits to the spleen, and spleen transmits to the kidney; this is the transmission and transformation of the five organs, with each overcoming its corresponding counterpart. Therefore, it is said that transmission is the name for the act of riding upon.]<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Pain</strong></p>
<p>All illnesses arise from emotions. When angry, qi rises; when joyful, qi softens; when sad, qi dissipates; when fearful, qi descends; when cold, qi contracts; when hot, qi leaks; when startled, qi becomes chaotic; when overworked, qi is diminished; when overly contemplative, qi becomes stagnant. Anger causes qi to reverse, and if severe, it can lead to vomiting blood and diarrhea, thus qi rises. Joy harmonizes qi and enhances spirit, leading to a relaxed state, hence qi softens. Sadness causes the heart to be anxious, the lungs to lift, and the upper jiao to be obstructed, preventing the dispersal of nutrients and resulting in stagnant heat within, hence qi dissipates. Fear causes essence to retreat, which can close off the upper jiao, causing qi to revert and the lower jiao to bloat, thus qi does not circulate. Cold closes the pores, leading to stagnation, hence qi contracts. Heat opens the pores, allowing for smooth circulation, resulting in significant sweating, thus qi leaks. Startle leads to a mind without support and a spirit without resting place, causing worries to be unsettled, hence qi becomes chaotic. Overexertion leads to panting and sweating, with both external and internal flow disrupted, thus qi is diminished. Contemplation causes the heart to latch onto thoughts and the spirit to have a resting point, retaining upright qi which does not circulate, hence qi becomes stagnant.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Anger pertains to the liver, which stores blood; when angry, the liver qi rises, which can lead to vomiting blood. The wood element affects the spleen, resulting in diarrhea. The spleen is located in the central region, while the liver is situated below; thus, both vomiting blood and diarrhea are manifestations of upward qi. Joy brings harmony and openness to the mind, allowing the qi to flow smoothly and gently. When the heart qi merges with the lungs, it leads to sadness; if heart sadness intensifies, the heart becomes anxious, causing the upper body&#39;s qi to become obstructed and the defensive qi to fail in dispersing. When qi is stagnant internally, it generates heat, and if the middle qi does not circulate, it leads to hidden consumption. Fear damages the kidneys, causing the essence and qi to retreat and fail to ascend. The zhongdan (chest area) serves as the sea of qi, rising from the lungs to control respiration, yet originally derives from the lower region; thus, if essence and qi retreat, the upper region closes, leading to an upward qi being redirected downward, causing distention in the lower area. With no exchange of qi between upper and lower, qi becomes stagnant. When cold qi invades the pores, the pores close and qi does not flow, resulting in internal retention. When heat opens the pores, excessive sweating occurs, causing yang qi to leak outward. Surprise scatters the heart qi, making it feel unanchored; the spirit becomes unsettled with nowhere to return, and thoughts become chaotic, leading to disarray in qi. Overexertion damages kidney qi, causing internal panting, while yang qi expands and sweating occurs externally, leading to imbalance between internal and external forces and dispersing qi. Excessive thinking retains the heart spirit within, causing righteous qi to stagnate and preventing its movement, thus resulting in qi stagnation.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Pulse Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The Yangming (Greater Yang) speaks of severe conditions leading to Qi collapse. The malevolent, akin to fire, upon hearing the sound of wood, startles and trembles. This is because Yang energy and Yin energy are weakened against each other, causing an adverse relation between water and fire, hence the disturbance and fear. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When Yangming Qi collapses, it indicates a disease of the Yangming pulse; evil people relate to fire, and the fear caused by the sound of wood signifies disturbance and alarm.</p>
<p>The Shaoyang (Lesser Yang) refers to insufficient Qi leading to a propensity for anger. When Yang energy is not rectified, it cannot be released. The liver Qi needs to be treated but has not been; thus, it leads to anger. This propensity for anger is referred to as &quot;boiling Qi collapse.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Shaoyang governs Qi. In autumn, as Yang energy decreases and is not expressed outwardly, Shaoyang energy cannot be released, leading to insufficient Qi. The liver Qi connects with the lesser and greater Yang; when Shaoyang energy is not released, liver Qi must be treated but remains unaddressed. The internal stagnation of liver Qi results in anger. &quot;Boiling Qi collapse&quot; represents deep frustration and reversal.</p>
<p>As for the concept of fear, it is akin to being hunted. In autumn, as the Qi diminishes but has not completely vanished, with insufficient Yin and incoming Yang, there is weakened interaction between Yin and Yang, leading to fear.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although Yang energy enters during autumn, Yin energy remains scant, so while all things decline, they have not entirely disappeared. Even with insufficient Yin, it is about to emerge, but when in conflict with the incoming Yang, both Shaoyang and Jueyin energies are harmed, leading to a deficiency in liver Qi and resulting in fear. In gallbladder ailments, the person feels a vague discomfort beneath the heart, as if being hunted.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></p></div>

<p>Fear can lead to a downward spiral, causing wheezing related to the liver, while excessive emotional energy damages the spleen. Shock leads to fear, causing wheezing related to the lungs, and excessive emotional energy harms the heart. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Injury leads to damage in the tendons, with the liver governing the tendons, which is why wheezing is associated with the liver. Wood overcomes earth, and thus excessive emotional energy harms the spleen. Shock causes chaotic energy, leading to wheezing from the lungs. The lungs cover the heart, hence excessive emotional energy harms the heart. </p>

<p><strong>Discussion on the Five Energies</strong></p>
<p>The stomach experiences reversed qi, leading to belching and fear. The gallbladder is associated with anger. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The stomach is affected by the cold qi of the lungs, causing a desire for it to be expelled, leading to belching. When the stomach&#39;s reversed qi descends to the kidneys, it results in fear. This is because the kidneys integrate with the stomach&#39;s energies. The gallbladder serves as the central authority, characterized by decisiveness; when ill, its qi becomes stagnated, resulting in anger. </p>
<p>The five essences combine: when essence and qi converge in the heart, it leads to joy; in the lungs, to sadness; in the liver, to worry; in the spleen, to fear; and in the kidneys, to terror, known as the five combinations, which are empty yet interrelated. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The heart is a yang organ; its essence is yin, which causes joy. When the lungs are deficient and the liver energy combines with the lungs, it causes sadness; when the liver is weak and the spleen energy combines with the liver, it leads to worry; when the spleen is deficient and the kidney energy combines with the spleen, it results in fear. A deficiency of yin leads to the influx of yang into yin, causing a weakening of the balance and thus fear. </p>
<p>When yang enters yin, there is tranquility; when yin emerges, there is anger.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The text discusses the relationship between the &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; aspects of illness in traditional Chinese medicine. It explains that when the evil from the yang enters the yin, the patient becomes tranquil, as an excess of yin leads to stillness. Conversely, when the evil from the yin exits the yang, the patient becomes easily angered, as an excess of yang causes anger.</p>
<p>It describes the five types of evils: spring gaining autumn&#39;s pulse, summer gaining winter&#39;s pulse, late summer gaining spring&#39;s pulse, autumn gaining summer&#39;s pulse, and winter gaining late summer&#39;s pulse. This condition is referred to as &quot;yang emerging from yin,&quot; leading to anger that is hard to treat, indicating an alignment of all five evils and resulting in fatality if untreated.</p>
<p>The text also notes that the characteristics of the seasons—spring representing strings, summer representing hooks, autumn representing fur, and winter representing stones—correspond to the proper qi of the five organs in yin and yang. When the pulse reflects the overcoming of the proper state, it indicates that the evil has become dominant. This imbalance leads to disturbances in the internal organ qi, reflecting on the pulse, thus being named &quot;yang emerging from yin.&quot; When the evil exits through the pulse, it shows an excess of blood, aligning with the saying that &quot;an excess of blood leads to anger.&quot; This imbalance is characterized by the proper qi being overwhelmed by the evil qi, marking it as a condition that is difficult to remedy. The idea of &quot;untreatable&quot; signifies that the pulses indicate a dominance of the evil. If the qi of the five organs is also overtaken by the evil, thus indicating opposing pulses according to the seasons, it indicates a situation that is fatal and untreatable.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

Qi Bo answered: Yang energy, when violently stifled and difficult to release, leads to a propensity for anger; this condition is termed &#39;yang collapse.&#39; 【Note: When liver qi rises against the flow, the yang energy is violently stifled, making it hard to circulate, thus liver qi is also unable to be treated, which results in the propensity for anger.】<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>On the Elucidation of Subtlety</h3>
<p>Sadness leads to tears, with tears being the source of moisture. The essence of water is accumulation; it is the ultimate yin. The ultimate yin is the essence of the kidneys. The reason the essence of water does not flow is that it is retained. Wrapped and contained, thus the water does not circulate. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: Sadness stirs the heart and will, causing tears to flow, which is the source of water. The essence of water refers to the gathering of the channels, the path of the upper fluid. The essence of the kidney-water, gathered through the channels, rises to connect with the heart externally and flows to the eyes, hence the eyes are where the channels converge. If the will is not sad, then the essence remains below, wrapped and contained, and the water essence does not emerge from the channels, thus it does not flow upward.]</strong></p>
<p>The essence of water is the will, and the essence of fire is the spirit. When water and fire interact, both spirit and will are saddened, hence the moisture in the eyes is produced. Therefore, the saying goes: when the heart is sad, it is called a sad will, as the spirit and essence of the heart converge in the eyes. </p>
<p><strong>[Note: The focus of the heart is referred to as the will; it is the unity of heart and will. The heart is the specialized essence of the five organs, thus the essence of water and that of the heart coalesce in the eyes to produce tears.]</strong></p>
<p>Thus, when both are sad, the spirit energy transmits to the heart, but the essence does not ascend to the will, so the will is exclusively sad, resulting in tears being shed. </p>

<p>Tears and weeping relate to the brain. The brain is associated with yin: &quot;Tai Su&quot; (Great Origin) Vol. 29, on water, states it as &quot;yang.&quot; The marrow is the filling of the bones.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The brain&#39;s seepage manifests as tears. The will (or longing) is the master of the bones; thus, as water flows, tears follow suit, echoing their nature. </p>
<p>The essence of the bones is contained in the marrow, which rises from the bone cavity to connect with the brain; hence, the brain&#39;s seepage results in tears. The will, as the master of the bones, allows for the flow of water, thus tears emerge alongside it. The actions of will and sorrow closely resemble one another, as the essence from the kidneys spills from the eyes to create weeping.</p>
<p>Tears and weeping are akin to brothers; in times of urgency, they both perish, and in times of life, they both thrive together. If one&#39;s will is filled with early sorrow, both tears and weeping emerge and flow together. </p>
<p>When tears and weeping emerge together, it is due to their belonging to the same category associated with the kidneys. </p>
<p>If there are no tears, it signifies that the cry lacks sorrow. When one does not weep, the spirit lacks compassion. Without compassion, the will cannot express sorrow; when Yin and Yang hold each other in balance, how can tears come alone? When the will is sorrowful, the overwhelming emotion pushes against the Yin, which disturbs the will and thus drains the spirit. If the spirit does not guard the essence, it departs from the eyes, leading to the release of tears and weeping.</p>
<p>The balance of Yin and Yang refers to the harmonious interplay of the spirit and will internalized, preventing the essence from leaking out. The overwhelming emotion refers to the will rising to the brain. The eyes are connected to the brain, thus when the will rises and pushes against the Yin, it causes the will to flee toward the eyes; if the will is lost, the spirit cannot guard its essence, leading to a release from the eyes, resulting in weeping.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a></p></div>

The thighs and legs are affected, causing headaches and restlessness, dizziness, sweating, and long-term symptoms like dim vision. The person experiences sorrow, joy, and fear, suffers shortness of breath and unhappiness; death follows within three years.<br><em>Note: The penetration of wind dampness affects both upper and lower regions, hence the persistence of illness. Cold damages the heart&#39;s fire, while heat damages the yin of the kidneys, making recovery difficult, thus the conditions cannot cease.

<p><strong>Pulse of Terror</strong></p>
<p>Question: What does the pulse of a person suffering from terror look like?<br>Answer: The pulse moves like a tangled thread, and the face is pale and discolored.</p>
<p><strong>Classic of Internal Medicine</strong> by Hua Tuo (Han Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Desires Lead to Qi Stagnation</strong></p>
<p>Qi stagnation arises from excessive sorrow, joy, anger, and thoughts, resulting in the qi becoming blocked above. If it persists, it harms the lungs; when the lungs are damaged, the vital qi gradually diminishes, allowing the pathogenic qi to dominate. If it remains above, it causes fullness in the chest and abdomen, leading to an inability to eat; if it descends, it results in heaviness in the waist and feet, making movement difficult. If it attacks the left, the left side won&#39;t comply; if it strikes the right, there is numbness on the right; if it pierces the tongue, one cannot speak; if it affects the intestines, one cannot urinate. If it becomes congested and doesn&#39;t disperse, it causes pain; if it flows but does not gather, it causes numbness. When the genuine qi is depleted, treatment becomes difficult. If the pathogenic qi is not overpowering, recovery is easier. The pulse manifests as a deep, slow, and slippery right wrist. It is advisable to moderate worries to nurture qi, exercise caution in anger to preserve the genuine, which is the best approach.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Origin of Laughter</strong></p>
<p>Laughter is abundant, fresh, and virtuous, flourishing and becoming apparent; it is a transformation of fire, thus it is a manifestation of the heart&#39;s fiery intent. When joy reaches its peak, laughter emerges, akin to a burning flame. The sound of joy is also the symbol of laughter. Therefore, those who laugh due to illness harbor excessive fire. Some may not truly feel joy in their hearts but laugh due to mockery or jest; this is commonly referred to as a cold laugh. When one laughs against their own heart&#39;s sincerity, transgressing moral boundaries, it leads to a sense of shame and loss of resolve. </p>
<p>Moreover, when one lightly touches another&#39;s neck, armpits, abdomen, sides, thighs, calves, or feet, causing them to itch and laugh, this is a disturbance of fiery energy. The transformation of calm, tranquil waters is disrupted, and the skin, which represents fire, visibly reacts. The delicate and hidden aspects pertain to water; if fire disrupts the water&#39;s essence, the person gradually loses their resolve and feels itching, leading them to laugh, as water weakens and fire surges.</p>
<p>If one disturbs themselves but does not laugh, it is due to the absence of shame or itching. Yet, when one feels both ashamed and itchy, it signifies a transformation of the heart&#39;s fire. When a person loses their confidence and feels ashamed, it is because water diminishes and fire intensifies. The relationship between will and confidence relates to the transformation of kidney water. However, those who are itchy but not ashamed, or ashamed but not itchy, cannot laugh, as their subtle transformation is incapable of movement.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Origin of Sorrow and Illness</h3>
<p>Sorrow arises from the spirit of the metal element, and metal and wood can cause dryness, transforming into fire. The fire of the heart pertains to heat and joy in pain, hence when one experiences sorrow and anguish, the heart and spirit become disturbed and agitated, rather than clear and tranquil, leading to weeping. When the five bodily fluids are all released, it is due to an extreme excess of fiery heat, which is also countered by the transformation and regulation of water. The five organs are the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, and their corresponding emotions are anger, joy, sorrow (or worry), thought, and fear. When any emotion is excessive, it can injure the corresponding organ. All injuries from the five emotions result in heat. The six desires are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind; the seven emotions are joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, aversion, and desire. When the liver is affected, it relates to fiery heat. The saying goes: the yang is active while yin is still, hence when the form and spirit are overworked, they become restless and agitated; when at peace, they are clear and harmonious. Thus, the highest goodness is like water, while the greatest folly is like fire. The ancient sages said: the six desires and seven emotions are a concern for the Way, and they pertain to fire. Just as a stroke can lead to unevenness and withering, when the heart fire becomes excessively violent and water cannot rein it in, the fire can control metal, and metal cannot control wood, causing the liver wood to become excessive and combined with fiery heat, which can lead to sudden collapse and paralysis, often due to the overindulgence in the five emotions and seven feelings. Similarly, intoxication leads to heat, causing the five emotions and seven feelings to stir up, hence the classics say: tremors, confusion, sorrowful laughter, delirium, singing, and cursing madness are all caused by heat. Therefore, those with extreme heat and madness all bear this symptom.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Rituals of Filial Piety</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty - Zhang Congzheng)</strong>  </p>
<p>The nine atmospheres influence illness and treat each other in succession.</p>
<p>Heaven is illuminated by its essence, and the earth is sustained by its atmosphere. All things flourish between heaven and earth, all born of this essence. When illness arises, it is also derived from this atmosphere. The essence of wind is gentle, opening yet subtle; the essence of heat is warm and comforting; the essence of fire brings extreme heat and encourages action; the essence of moisture is heavy and suffocating; the essence of dryness is clear and harsh; the essence of cold brings winter chill and leads to concealment. These six essences are the regular transformations of nature. When they change, the wind essence may become turbulent and restore great coolness; the heat essence may become overly warm and reverse to cold; the fire essence may bring fierce gales and return frost; the moisture essence may bring sudden thunderstorms and result in violent winds; the dry essence may disperse and create wetness; the cold essence may bring snow, frost, and hail and result in white dust. This is the transformation of the six essences. Therefore, if heaven is persistently cold, one regulates it with warmth; if heaven is persistently cool, one regulates it with heat; if heaven is persistently dark, one regulates it with light; if heaven is persistently clear, one regulates it with rain. The essences of heaven and earth remain stable in normalcy but become illnesses in change. Furthermore, humans receive the essences of heaven and earth, with the five movements repeatedly invading from outside and the seven emotions battling within; thus, the wise cherish the essence as one would a precious treasure, while the foolish exploit material things and inadvertently harm harmony.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>This text discusses how all pains and diseases arise from &quot;qi&quot; (vital energy), leading to the theory of nine different types of qi. While qi is fundamentally one, it becomes nine due to various influences. The nine types refer to anger, joy, grief, fear, cold, heat, shock, contemplation, and labor.</p>
<p>It states: when angry, qi reverses; if severe, it can lead to vomiting blood and diarrhea, hence qi rises. Wang Taifu said that anger causes yang qi to rise and liver wood to overtake the spleen, explaining the severe symptoms. Joy harmonizes qi and enables the spirit, allowing for smooth circulation of protective qi, thus making qi gentle. Grief causes the heart to become urgent, leading to lung dysfunction and blockage in the upper section, where heat accumulates, causing qi to decrease. Fear results in the retention of essence, closing the upper section and leading to stagnation and swelling in the lower section, preventing qi from flowing. Wang Taifu noted that fear can harm essence, making it unable to descend, and the lower section&#39;s yin qi can also become stagnant, causing swelling. The upper section remains blocked, and the lower section’s qi returns, thus qi does not flow.</p>
<p>The text states: &quot;not flowing&quot; should be interpreted as &quot;descending.&quot; Cold causes the pores to close, leading qi to descend and thus accumulate. Wang Taifu explained that if the body feels cold, the protective qi condenses, resulting in the pores and drainage points tightly closing, preventing qi from circulating, and protective qi gathering internally without dispersing. When it is hot, the pores open, allowing the protective and nourishing qi to circulate freely, leading to substantial sweating and hence the release of qi.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Wang Taifu said: When people are in the sun, they feel comfort; when in the shade, they feel sadness. Therefore, when it is hot, the skin pores open, the nutrients and defenses flow freely, and fluids and sweat are expelled in large quantities. When startled, the heart has no support, the spirit has no place to return, and thoughts are unsettled; thus, the vital energy becomes chaotic. When overworked, there is shortness of breath and sweating, with both internal and external states becoming excessive; thus, the vital energy is depleted. Wang Taifu said: When fatigued and laboring, the vital energy runs swiftly, causing breathlessness; when the vital energy rushes, it manifests externally, leading to sweating; both internal and external exceed their normal limits, thus depleting the energy. When thinking, the heart has something to hold onto, the spirit has a place to return, and正气 (upright energy) remains and does not disperse, hence the energy becomes stagnant. Wang Taifu said: When the heart is focused and not scattered, the energy also remains stationary. This discussion in the &quot;Suwen&quot; on the nine types of qi is very detailed, and its principles are very clear. However, the discussion of diseases caused by the nine types of qi is brief; it only mentions vomiting blood and diarrhea, leaving out the rest. Only the &quot;Ling Shu&quot; discusses illnesses caused by excessive thoughts, sadness, joy, and other emotions, stating: A wise person who nurtures life must follow the four seasons, adapt to cold and heat, harmonize joy and anger, and settle in appropriate places, balancing yin and yang and harmonizing rigidity and softness; thus, evils do not approach, and longevity is achieved. Therefore, excessive anxiety and worry harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear arises and this results in unchecked desires. Because of sorrow, the energetic center becomes depleted, leading to loss of life.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Joyful individuals disperse their spirit and do not conceal it. Those burdened with worry have their energy blocked and do not flow. Those filled with intense anger confuse their spirit and do not heal. Those in fear have their spirit shaken and do not gather. Overthinking and anxiety harm the spirit; when the spirit is harmed, fear arises, leading to physical ailments that manifest in deterioration and a faded complexion, resulting in death during winter. </p>
<p>If the spleen is worried and cannot find relief, it damages the will; when the will is harmed, it causes confusion, resulting in weakened limbs, a faded complexion, and death in spring. When the liver feels sorrow, it harms the soul; when the soul is damaged, it leads to wild forgetfulness and lack of clarity. This lack of clarity causes contraction and tightness in the body, leading to weakened limbs, a faded complexion, and death in autumn. </p>
<p>When the lungs experience endless joy, they harm the ethereal soul; when the soul is harmed, it causes madness, leading to a loss of self-awareness, resulting in dry skin, a faded complexion, and death in summer. When the kidneys are filled with anger and do not cease, they harm the will; when the will is damaged, joy turns into forgetfulness of promises, causing the back to become rigid and the body to lose flexibility, resulting in a faded complexion and death in late summer.</p>
<p>Unresolved fear harms the essence; when the essence is damaged, it leads to bone pain and weakness. Thus, the five organs are responsible for storing essence and must not be harmed. If they are harmed, it leads to a loss of balance, causing deficiency; in deficiency, there is no energy, and without energy, there is death. The &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; discusses the illnesses governed by the spirit, will, soul, essence, and consciousness.

When the mind is disturbed, it can cause insomnia, excessive sleepiness, dizziness, obstruction in the three burning spaces (upper, middle, and lower), throat discomfort, gallbladder stagnation with bitter vomiting, weakness in the muscles, excessive sexual fluid, and when gas becomes stagnant, it can feel light and fleeting. Additionally, it can cause an aversion to food. When cold energy disrupts, it leads to clear and cold bodily fluids being excreted from above and below, diarrhea with clear water, vomiting of foul substances, loss of appetite, and severe abdominal distention with urgent pain and congestion, as well as various lumps, hernias, and difficulty in bending or stretching, with symptoms of cold extremities and rigidity. When heat energy disrupts, it causes shortness of breath, acidic vomiting, immediate pressure below, muscle cramps, cloudy urine, a swollen abdomen that makes sounds like a drum, sores, ulcers, and various skin eruptions, as well as vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, swelling in the nose, bleeding, excessive heat or chills in the body, and in severe cases, disorientation, dim vision, ringing or deafness in the ears, anxiety and madness, exclamations of shock, as if one has lost their mind, with energy in reverse rising up, spitting foul fluids, loss of appetite, painful and swollen areas, sudden onset of serious illness, and death. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Joy harms the heart, while the heart is associated with fire. When joy is excessive, the qi converges in the heart, causing the lungs (metal) to suffer from affliction; if fire is too strong, the heart will also be ill. Grief harms the lungs, which are associated with metal. When grief is excessive, the qi converges in the lungs, causing the liver (wood) to suffer from affliction; if metal is too strong, the lungs will also be ill. Fear harms the kidneys, which are associated with water. When fear is excessive, the qi converges in the kidneys, causing the heart (fire) to suffer from affliction; if water is too strong, the kidneys will also be ill. Thinking harms the spleen, which is associated with earth. When thought is excessive, the qi converges in the spleen, causing the kidneys (water) to suffer from affliction; if earth is too strong, the spleen will also be ill. Cold harms the body, which is associated with yin. When cold overcomes heat, yang suffers illness; if cold is too strong, yin will also be ill. Heat harms the qi, which is associated with yang.

All five of these methods must be devious and peculiar, employing whatever means necessary to move people&#39;s hearts and eyes, making it easier to influence their sight and hearing.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Jiong can treat cold. For cold outside, use a heated needle (fire) to cauterize and induce sweating; for cold inside, balance it with warm food and warming medicines. Cold can also treat jiong. For jiong outside, use a cool room, a chilly bed, and light clothing to induce sweating with cooling medicines; for jiong inside, balance it with cold drinks and cold medicines. Only rest can treat fatigue, as the classics say, fatigue should be warmed, which means to care for and nurture it. Modern doctors have a far-off understanding, treating warmth as simply a warming medicine. Qi Bo said: to balance is to rest as well. Only habituation can treat fright, as the classics say, fright should be balanced, referring to stability. Fright comes unexpectedly, but if one becomes accustomed to seeing and hearing, one will not be startled. These nine principles are from the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; inherently rational, yet inept craftsmen abandon them. In the present day, Liu Hejian interprets the five emotions, uniquely grasping the deeper meaning, stating that the five emotions arise from the heart; thus, the signs of joy, anger, sorrow, fear, and thought are all centered on balancing heartfire. Furthermore, fatigue is caused by movement, and movement belongs to yang; fright stems from the heart, and the heart belongs to fire. Both of these are also centered on balancing the heart. Modern doctors do not grasp this intention, leading to misunderstandings about coldness, which proliferate noisily.

<p><strong>Methods for Treating Emotional Illnesses</strong></p>
<p>Anger harms the liver, causing qi to rise and leading to vomiting if excessive. Use the Er Chen Tang with Zhi Ke, or the Gan Zhu Zheng Qi Tian Xiang Tang; if there is heat, use Chai Chen Tang. Worry harms the lungs, causing qi to accumulate and leading to wheezing if excessive. Use Su Zi Jiang Qi Tang or Fen Qi Zi Su Yin. For a throat obstruction, temporarily use the Wu Ge Kuan Zhong Yin. Sadness harms the heart and lung systems, causing qi to become urgent, and if excessive can lead to madness. Use Zhi Ke decocted to disperse, or Sheng Yang Shun Qi Tang. Thoughtfulness harms the spleen, causing qi stagnation and leading to fullness if excessive. Use Tui Re Qing Qi Tang, Wen Dan Tang, Mu Xiang Hua Zhi Tang, or Mu Xiang Zhi Shu Wan. These four conditions all lead to the stagnation of evil qi, commonly presenting as excess symptoms. Furthermore, if there is excess, it can cause qi stagnation as well; if mild, movement can relieve it, if severe, use the Ju Pi Yi Wu Tang.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essentials of Medical Tradition</strong> 【Ming - Li Zhongzi】</p>
<p><strong>Fear Associated with the Four Organs</strong></p>
<p>The classics say: In the organs, it is the kidneys; in emotions, it is fear. It also states: When essence and qi converge in the kidneys, there is fear. Fear is, therefore, the emotional state associated with the kidneys. The discussion regarding other organs in the following sections also links back to the kidneys. The liver stores blood; when blood is insufficient, there is fear. The liver is the child of the kidneys. When water is abundant, the gallbladder is strong; when water is lacking, blood becomes deficient, causing fear. The stomach is also related to fear—the stomach belongs to earth, while the kidneys belong to water. When earth harms water, fear arises. The heart, when troubled by anxiety and thinking, harms the spirit. When the spirit is harmed, fear and loss of composure follow. The heart houses the spirit; when the spirit is hurt, the heart becomes timid, leading to fear and loss of composure, akin to fire being fearful of water. </p>
<p>In examining the classics, fear is associated with the kidneys, liver, heart, and stomach. The liver and gallbladder are linked to the kidneys, sharing the same source; the stomach in relation to the kidneys is something that cannot be surpassed; and the heart in relation to the kidneys is fearful of being overpowered. Hence, the phenomenon of fear is fundamentally tied to the kidneys, while also involving other organs; thus, treatment methods differ accordingly. For kidney injuries, one should adopt nourishing flavors, using herbs like goji berries, polygala root, rehmannia root, cornelian cherry, poria, achyranthes, and eucommia bark. For liver and gallbladder nourishing, one should focus on nourishing yin with herbs such as sour jujube seed, cornelian cherry, peony root, white peony, licorice, and dragon&#39;s teeth. For treating the Yangming system, one needs to boost vitality, using a modified Four Gentlemen Decoction with increased poria. To stabilize the heart, one should calm the spirit with herbs like cinnabar, amber, gold and silver leaf, rhinoceros horn, and dragon&#39;s teeth.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Medical Laws of the Physician</strong><br><strong>By Yu Chang, Qing Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart as the Master of the Organs</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Essence of the Heart&quot; says: When the heart is anxious and overthinks, it injures the spirit; if the spirit is harmed, fear and confusion arise. The passage on &quot;Evil Qi and Organ Afflictions&quot; states: Worry and fear injure the heart. The &quot;Inquiry on the Mouth&quot; notes: Sadness and worry disturb the heart, which in turn causes all the five viscera and six bowels to be shaken. It is evident that the heart is the great master of the five viscera and six bowels, presiding over the soul and spirit, and encompassing intention and will. Therefore, when worry arises in the heart, the lungs respond; when thoughts arise in the heart, the spleen responds; when anger arises in the heart, the liver responds; when fear arises in the heart, the kidneys respond. This illustrates how the five emotions are directed by the heart. If one can nurture this heart well, dwell in tranquility, remain untroubled by fear or overly joyful, gracefully adapt to circumstances without contention, and change with time without a strong sense of self, then intention and will are harmonious, the spirit is settled, regret and anger do not arise, the soul remains intact, and the five viscera are at peace. Thus, what can evil do to me?<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Secret Formula of the Stone Chamber</strong><br><strong>[Qing Dynasty - Chen Shiduo]</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Treatment Method for Liver Injury Due to Anger</strong>  </p>
<p>When a person feels gloomy and unhappy, and suddenly suffers from a blockage of energy that prevents them from speaking, if not treated properly, they may die. Gloom has always inflicted harm on the liver; can one injure the liver further? Injuring the liver only exacerbates the gloom, which cannot be alleviated. How then can one save a life in an instant?  </p>
<p>The formula to rescue the liver and open up the gloom consists of:<br>Two taels of White Peony Root,<br>One qian each of Bupleurum and Licorice,<br>Three qians of White Mustard Seed,<br>Five qians each of Atractylodes, Poria, and Angelica,<br>Two qians of Dried Tangerine Peel,<br>Boil with water and take orally.  </p>
<p>One dose will restore the voice, the second will calm the spirit, and the third will completely resolve the stagnant energy. The brilliance of this formula lies in the use of a maximum of two taels of White Peony Root, which directly enters the liver channel to replenish its deficient energy, naturally allowing the blood to be generated and the fire to be extinguished. Additionally, the use of Atractylodes and Angelica nourishes the earth to produce blood, Bupleurum alleviates stagnation, Licorice harmonizes the center, and White Mustard Seed dissolves phlegm obstructing the diaphragm. Furthermore, the heavy use of Poria ensures that stagnant energy and phlegm are entirely absorbed into the bladder and dissipated without a trace.  </p>
<p>If a person has unresolved stagnation and appears wan and emaciated, they must be treated urgently with this formula, lest they undergo unforeseen transformations!<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Treatment for Timidity</strong></p>
<p>When a person is timid and dares not face others, it is due to the deficiency of the lesser yang gallbladder meridian. The cause of this deficiency in the lesser yang gallbladder meridian is the weakness of the liver wood. Furthermore, the weakness of the liver wood results from the insufficient water of the kidneys. The treatment should therefore focus on nourishing the kidneys to promote the growth of the liver wood. </p>
<p>For this, use one ounce of cooked rehmannia, four taels of mountain cornel, five taels each of peony, angelica, and poria, and one tael each of bupleurum, white mustard seed, jujube seeds, and cinnamon. Prepare this as a decoction to take. </p>
<p>The effectiveness of this formula lies in its ability to nourish the kidneys while also replenishing the liver. It is particularly ingenious to omit anything that nourishes the heart, ensuring that the heart does not draw blood from the liver and gallbladder. This way, the bile can become abundant and the timidity can be alleviated. Additionally, using cinnamon to enter the liver is brilliant, as it instills courage, making the timid naturally bold. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yellow Emperor asked Gaoyangfu about the Five Labors. Gaoyangfu replied: &quot;The first is labor of will, the second is labor of thought, the third is labor of the heart, the fourth is labor of worry, and the fifth is labor of fatigue; these are known as the Five Labors.&quot; The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;How can they be treated?&quot; Gaoyangfu said: &quot;The Shiwai Pill is the main remedy for them.&quot;</p>
<p>The ingredients include: Stone Bulrush, Fine Cinnabar, Jian Stone, Distant Wisdom, Poria, Water Plantain, Sweet Flag, Eucommia, Cowherb Seeds, Flesh of Cistanche, Balloon Flower, Tianxiong, Cowslip, Mountain Cornel, Cypress Seed, Rehmannia, Dioscorea—each two taels; and Fangfeng and Red Stone Fat—each three taels. </p>
<p>Grind these nineteen ingredients into a powder, take jujube paste with honey, and form pills the size of walnuts. Take thirty pills with wine, three times a day. You will recover in seven days, and all ailments will be eliminated in twenty days. Long-term use is beneficial.</p>
<p>The Neibu San treats the Five Labors and Six Deficiencies in men. Those with heart injuries are easily startled and prone to sudden anger; those with spleen injuries tend to feel a fullness in the belly, are joyful yet flatulent, want to lie down after eating, and have a sallow complexion. The Six Deficiencies cause people to feel dizzy in the heart, not wanting to speak, and averse to the sound of others.</p>
<p>The ingredients include: Rehmannia, Cuscuta Seed, Mountain Cornel, and Earth Wheat—each five taels; Distant Wisdom and Morinda Root—each half tael; Ophiopogon, Schisandra, Licorice, Ginseng, Cistanche, Dendrobium, Cinnamon Heart, Poria, and Aconite—each one tael.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Su Wen&quot; states: When the liver is weak, the eyes can see nothing, and the ears can hear nothing; one feels great fear, as if one were about to be captured. Treat using the channels of the Jueyin and Shaoyang. When the kidneys are weak, there is pain in the chest and pain in the abdomen, both upper and lower; there is a feeling of emptiness, and one is not happy. Treat using the channels of the Shaoyin and Taiyang to access the blood. The Yangming channel causes pain in the lower back, making it impossible to turn; if one turns, it feels as if there is something visible, leading to a feeling of sorrow. Acupuncture on the Yangming channel at three points before the knee and harmonizing above and below will cause bleeding; in autumn, it does not bleed. The Jie Mai channel causes lower back pain as if pulled by a strap, often in a bent-over posture, leading to great fear. Acupuncture on the Jie Mai at the Xie point will cause blood to flow, shooting out like millet; bleeding will show red blood only. </p>
<p>The Feiyang channel causes lower back pain, with a sensation of heaviness that may lead to sorrow and fear. Acupuncture on the Feiyang channel located five &quot;cuns&quot; above the inner ankle, in front of the Shaoyin and where it meets the Yinwei, is beneficial. If someone experiences a fall, with evil blood retained internally, causing abdominal distention and an inability to move forward or backward, one should first drink a laxative. This affects the upper channel of Jueyin and the lower channel of Shaoyin. Acupuncture below the inner ankle in front of the Yangu will cause blood to flow, and acupuncture on the proximal artery of the foot will require several needles; if not effective, needle three points on the upper foot to encourage blood flow, showing blood immediately. Needle on the left for the right side, and on the right for the left. If one is sorrowful, startled, or unhappy, needle as if aiming to the right. </p>
<p>When evil enters the channels of the foot&#39;s Shaoyin, it causes throat pain and an inability to eat, alongside unreasonable anger with Qi rising to the upper regions. Needle the central meridian below the foot three times each side, totaling six needle points for immediate relief. Needle on the left for the right side, and on the right for the left.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yellow Emperor asked: What causes a person to grieve and shed tears? Qibo replied: The heart is the master of the five viscera and six bowels. The eyes are where the primary vessels converge and are the path for ascending fluids. The mouth and nose are the gateways of breath. Therefore, when sad, grieved, or anxious, the heart is moved; when the heart moves, all the five viscera and six bowels are shaken; when shaken, the primary vessels are affected; when affected, the fluid pathways open; thus, tears flow. The fluids are what nourish and moisten the empty orifices, so when the path for ascending fluids is open, tears flow; if tears flow continuously, the fluids become depleted; when the fluids are depleted, essence cannot be nourished; when essence is not nourished, the eyes can see nothing. Hence it is termed the loss of essence, and the treatment involves supplementing the Tianshu channel along the neck.</p>

<p>The &quot;Rumen Shiqin&quot; states: Mr. Dai&#39;s younger son, after taking a wife, became increasingly thin and spoke as if from within a jar. This illness is internal. He often twirled his third finger and lost his smile; this indicated heart fire. After about half a year, he drank ice and snow daily and took cool medicines. Mr. Dai said: &quot;Avoid the cold, and you will get better.&quot; His wife feared it was too cold, and Mr. Dai replied: &quot;I use medicine as one would respond to a drum with a clapper; you, my kin, still dislike cool medicine, thus it is no wonder the world slanders me.&quot; By July, he had grown tired of ice and no longer drank it, and his illness gradually diminished.</p>
<p>A certain person fell ill from excessive joy. Mr. Zhuang felt his pulse and rendered him voiceless, pretending to say: &quot;I will fetch medicine now.&quot; A few days passed without his return, and the patient wept, bidding farewell to friends and family, saying: &quot;I have not long to live.&quot; Mr. Zhuang knew he would recover and comforted him. When inquired, Mr. Zhuang referred to the &quot;Suwen,&quot; stating: &quot;Fear overcomes joy.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Dai, traveling through ancient Bo, encountered a woman who laughed incessantly due to her illness for over half a year. All physicians were at a loss. Mr. Dai said: &quot;This is easy to treat.&quot; He took two taels of salt blocks, heated them until red, cooled them down, and ground them finely. He then used a large bowl of river water to boil it until it bubbled three to five times. After it cooled, he administered it in three doses and probed her throat with a hairpin, causing her to expel five liters of hot phlegm. Next, he prescribed a large dose of Huanglian detoxifying decoction, and within a few days, her laughter settled. The &quot;Neijing&quot; states: &quot;When the spirit is excessive, laughter does not cease.&quot; This so-called spirit refers to heart fire. When fire receives wind, it forms flames, hence the symbol of laughter. Among the five elements, only fire is associated with laughter.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a></p></div>

Dai examined her and said: &quot;Both pulse points are weak; this is a disorder of the spleen, which governs thought.&quot; He advised her husband to provoke her with anger to draw out her emotions, took a great deal of their wealth, drank for several days, and left without providing any treatment.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Danxi Heart Method&quot; states: A woman, nineteen years old, with an excess of anger, suddenly yelled out one day and nearly fainted. This was due to phlegm obstructing above and fire rising from below. Initially, she was treated with five qian of xiangfu, three qian of sheng gancao, and seven qian of chuanchong, decocted with the urine of a child and ginger juice; she also took a pill made of qingdai and white xiangfu powder, which provided slight relief but did not eliminate the problem. Later, a thorough vomiting was performed and then she stabilized. After the vomiting, a phlegm-dissolving decoction with stir-fried huanglian, xiangfu, and ginger was given, and the Longhui pill was decocted down, leading to her recovery. </p>
<p>A girl, engaged to be married, had her husband away for business for two years without returning; she stopped eating and lay in a stupor, having no other ailments, choosing to lie facing the wall all day. Her father sought the help of Elder Danxi, who diagnosed the situation. After feeling her pulse, the elder stated, &quot;This is due to repressed feelings leading to stagnation of qi. Medicine alone cannot resolve this; she needs joy to relieve it. Otherwise, it will lead to anger.&quot; He then slapped her face, falsely accusing her of infidelity until she became extremely angry and cried out three times. Upon being calmed down, she immediately asked for food. The reason is that sadness depletes qi whereas anger overcomes repressed feelings. The elder told her father, &quot;Although her illness may seem cured, only happiness can truly resolve it.&quot; He then advised that the husband should return. Eventually, this proved effective, and the illness did not recur.</p>
<p>Another woman fell ill without understanding the cause, and when she slightly regained consciousness, she yelled several times before fainting again. Elder Danxi diagnosed her, finding her liver pulse tense, rapid, and slippery, stating, &quot;This is caused by anger; she must have been angered and then consumed strong liquor.&quot; Upon inquiry, it was revealed that she would drink whenever her husband was not around to soothe her feelings. The elder treated her with a formula to dispel phlegm and lower the fire, adding xiangfu to disperse the liver&#39;s stagnation, which led to her immediate recovery.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A man from Dongyang, Wu Zifang, was fifty years old, stocky and heavy-set, prone to worries and anger. His pulse was consistently deep and sludgy. Since spring, he suffered from phlegm-qi illness, and the physician deemed it a deficiency of cold, thus usually prescribing warming and aromatic dispersing medicines. By April, his legs became weak, qi surged upwards, and his appetite diminished. I said: this is caused by stagnant heat and a deficient spleen, resulting in symptoms of atrophy and coldness. Although he is corpulent and has a deep pulse, this is not a fatal sign. However, the heat evil is too intense; during this fire&#39;s peak, it is really difficult to seek recovery. I prescribed bamboo sap with white atractylodes paste, totaling two pounds. His qi descended and appetite improved, but a month later he broke into a great sweat and died.</p>
<p>A woman over the age of fifteen was energetic and thick in physique. During the hot months, due to a fit of rage, she experienced hiccups, which caused her to jump and move her entire body, becoming dazed and unaware of her surroundings. Upon inquiry, it was discovered she had a sudden illness. Observing her condition, both her form and qi were strong, so I prescribed a decoction of ginseng and reed. After drinking a bowl, she expelled several bowls of stubborn phlegm, broke out in a large sweat, and fell into a deep sleep for a day before recovering. Ginseng enters the hand taiyin channel, nourishing the yin within the yang, while reed greatly drains the yang of the taiyin. The woman, consumed by anger, had qi rising; the liver governs anger. The texts say that anger causes qi to rebel; due to anger, the qi reverses, and the wood of the liver overcomes the fire, oppressing the lungs, hence the severe hiccups and stupor. Ginseng and reed are good for supporting expulsion; with phlegm expelled and qi descending, the fire diminishes, the metal qi restores to its place, and the stomach&#39;s qi harmonizes, leading to resolution. Ephedra induces sweating, while also moderating excessive perspiration. Grains belong to metal; the nature of bran is hot. Wheat belongs to yang; the nature of chaff is cool. The ancients said everything possesses the ultimate principle (taiji). Shouldn&#39;t scholars engage in a comparative study and broaden their understanding from this?<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;The Medical Cases of Xue Ji&quot; states: A woman with weak vital energy often experienced phlegm and qi issues, sometimes feeling discomfort in her throat or chest oppression. I believed this was due to stagnation harming the spleen, so I treated her with a modified Gui Pi Decoction, and she recovered. Later, she encountered anger, and her previous symptoms reappeared. Confused by others&#39; opinions, she assumed it was phlegm and wrongly used expectorants, causing repeated vomiting and diarrhea, leading to various new symptoms and a stupor. I thought her spleen and stomach were injured again, so I prescribed Liu Jun Zi Tang daily, made a strong rice drink for her to take by the spoonful. After four days, she gradually progressed to eating porridge, then took the previous medicine, alternating with Gui Pi Decoction. Pleased with its nourishing effects, after more than two months, all symptoms disappeared.</p>

Her phlegm and qi surged upward, her legs felt hot, and she experienced bone pain. She took Wuyao Shunqi San and similar remedies, but her symptoms worsened, often feeling dizzy, with increased internal heat. I believed this was due to blood deficiency in the liver meridian, causing internal heat to generate wind, while the previous medicines further depleted liver blood, worsening the excessive fire. I first used Chai Hu Zhi Zhi San to nourish the qi and blood of the liver meridian. After several days, I employed Ba Zhen Tang with added Diao Teng Gou San, and her symptoms slightly improved. I then used the modified Ba Wei Wan, adding a small amount of wine-fried Huang Lian and Zhi Mu (black variety), and after several doses her symptoms retreated significantly. Finally, I continued using Ba Zhen Tang and Chai Hu Zhi Zhi San, and after half a year, she was healed.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>　　《医方考》曰：按《闻见录》云：州监军病悲思，其子迎赫允治之，允告其子曰：法当甚悸即愈。时通守李宋卿御史严甚，监军内所畏也。允与其子请于宋卿一造，问责其过失。监军惶怖汗出，疾乃愈。盖思则气结，惊怖则气浮，浮则气不结矣。此亦以情相胜也。<br>　　赵知则，太原人，因喜成疾，巢氏医脉之，为之惊异，出取药，竟不与之。数日，赵悲哭辞家人曰：处世不久矣。巢知其将愈，使人慰之。诘其故，引《素问》恐胜喜以对，可谓得玄关者也。<a id="orig-62p" href="#trans-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Examination of Medical Formulas&quot; states: According to the &quot;Records of Observations,&quot; there was a military governor who fell ill due to sorrow. His son sought the help of He Yuyin for treatment. Yuyin told the son, &quot;The method must be applied when his fear is intense, and then he will recover.&quot; At that time, the overseeing official, Li Songqing, was extremely severe, and the military governor was greatly intimidated by him. Yuyin and his son went to request an audience with Songqing to discuss the governor&#39;s errors. The military governor became anxious and broke into a sweat, which led to his eventual recovery. It is evident that when one is troubled, the energy gets trapped; when frightened, the energy becomes unsettled, and when unsettled, the energy cannot be contained. This illustrates the emotional influence on physical health.</p>
<p>Zhao Zhizhe, a person from Taiyuan, developed a disorder due to excessive joy, which astonished the physicians of the Chao clan. They went to fetch medicine but ultimately did not provide any. A few days later, Zhao mournfully told his family, &quot;My time in this world is short.&quot; Chao, knowing he would recover, sent someone to comfort him. When questioned about the reason for his condition, he referenced the &quot;Suwen,&quot; suggesting that fear could surpass joy in response, showing a deep understanding of the underlying principles.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Prime Minister Han fell ill, and when the sky showed no sign of rain, ten doctors were of no help. At last, Zuo Youxin arrived, took his pulse, and using his fingers calculated the heavenly stems and earthly branches, declaring: &quot;It will rain on such and such a day.&quot; He then left. Han doubted, wondering if his illness was such that he could not be cured. Why speak of rain when medication had not worked for me? That evening, it indeed rained, and Han was overjoyed, rising to walk in the courtyard until dawn, feeling as if his illness had vanished. He summoned Zuo and asked him. Zuo replied: &quot;Your illness was caused by worry. You have been thinking of your loyalty and kindness towards the people, and during this prolonged drought, it is understandable to be anxious for them. To worry about the drought means you also hope for rain to cure it. Thus, it is only natural, so why wait for medicine to be healed? This is also what the &#39;Suwen&#39; says: joy overcomes worry.&quot;</p>
<p>In a certain county, a dispatcher caught a criminal and brought him to the county, but midway, the criminal jumped into the river and died. The criminal&#39;s family accused the dispatcher of coercing the man to death through threats. The dispatcher might escape punishment but at the cost of his wealth. Overwhelmed with anger and grief, he fell ill, his mind drifting as if he were drunk, speaking nonsense and losing his senses. The local magistrate, Yan Dai, looked upon him with compassion, and Yan remarked: &quot;This illness has resulted from financial loss and will surely be cured by financial gain.&quot; He then ordered three ingots of tin to be made to resemble silver and placed them in a mud ditch, waiting for the right moment. He tricked the dispatcher into mistakenly dropping the keys into the ditch and commanded him to retrieve them, only to bring out the three tin ingots. The magistrate declared: &quot;This is silver, but I will not use this ill-gotten wealth; it must all be given to you.&quot; The dispatcher held it but could not part with it, and gradually, the illness diminished. This too is the principle that joy overcomes worry.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>A woman was very close to her mother; after marrying, her mother passed away, and she could not stop longing for her. Her spirit diminished, and she fell into a lethargy, rejecting all medicines. Her husband called upon Han Shiliang to treat her. Han said, &quot;This illness arises from longing; it is not easily cured by medicine but should be treated with skill.&quot; He then bribed a witch woman and taught her some secret words. One day, the husband said to his wife, &quot;Your longing for your mother is such that you do not know if she remembers you in the ground as well. I will go somewhere else; why don&#39;t you ask the witch woman to divine?&quot; The wife gladly agreed and summoned the witch. After burning incense and paying respects, her mother’s spirit appeared. In every word and silence, she seemed just like she was in life. The daughter wept greatly. The mother reprimanded her, saying, &quot;Do not weep! Your life has caused my death; I died early because of you. My death is all your fault. Now in the underworld, I desire to take revenge on you, and your illness is indeed due to me. When I was alive, I was with you as mother and child; now that I am dead, I am your enemy.&quot; After speaking, the daughter’s expression shifted to great anger, and she scolded, &quot;I am ill because of my mother, yet my mother wishes me harm. What joy is there in thinking of her?&quot; From that moment on, her illness was cured. This was also a healing through emotion.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Tan Zhi Su was a cautious speaker and served as an assistant in Shaozhou. One day, while at a banquet with his officials, there was a particularly large radish that drew everyone&#39;s admiration. Tan said, &quot;There are radishes as large as a person.&quot; The crowd laughed, thinking his claim was unbelievable. Tan felt regret and blamed himself, saying, &quot;Since people cannot see such a large one, they are right to dismiss my words as nonsense and laugh.&quot; As a result, he became worried and upset, unable to eat for several days. His son, Huang, who was well-read and knowledgeable about matters, remembered how his father rarely spoke lightly. Feeling ashamed, he fell ill and thought that his father&#39;s words must be genuine for him to be healed. He then sent someone to fetch a radish as large as a person and brought it to the official residence, insisting his father, who was unwell, accompany him. When the wine flowed and the radish was presented at the banquet, everyone was astonished, and his father was very happy. The next morning, his illness was cured. This is also reminiscent of the teaching in &quot;Suwen&quot; about joy overcoming sorrow.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Yuyi Cao&quot; states: Wu Tian&#39;s mother often experienced violent anger, which caused her menstrual cycle to stop. Since autumn, she gradually felt an upward reversal of Qi, as if fearing the rocking of a boat, and would immediately feel unwell, spending long periods lying in bed. It was as if the world was turned upside down, making it impossible for her to rise. Various medical treatments proved ineffective, so she began using three to five fen of ginseng, which offered slight relief for a moment. Eventually, she increased the dosage to five qian per dose, spending several golden coins daily, hoping for a quick stabilization to care for her young child. Her family&#39;s wealth was exhausted, her illness grew more critical, and she experienced intense thirst and pain, as if her head were being sliced by a knife. She ate little and had frequent diarrhea; she had treated her liver, but there were no other hopes left. Upon hearing that I returned to Lou Yan for a diagnosis, she entrusted me with her care, believing that I could save her. I explained that extreme anger causes blood to stagnate upwards, preventing Qi from descending; this is called the &quot;Reversal of Qi at the Vertex.&quot; The term &quot;reversal&quot; signifies an upward direction, while &quot;vertex&quot; denotes a high point. When both Qi and blood surge upwards, dizziness and disturbances occur. Furthermore, with excess above and deficiency below, the cause lies in the lesser Yang. The lesser Yang pertains to the Gallbladder meridian of the foot.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The gallbladder points are all connected to the brain. When the fire of pent-up anger attacks upwards to the brain and receives a supplement, it intensifies, causing pain akin to splitting, which is the same condition as vertigo. The wind and fire stir each other, hence causing trembling and heat; the wood and earth conflict, leading to difficulty in eating and excessive diarrhea. </p>
<p>Thus, the intention from the <em>Inner Canon</em> about the &quot;iron ball sinking&quot; is employed, substituting substances like cinnabar, gentian, aloe, and rhubarb to counteract the rebellious qi. With substances such as Chinese lacquer, peony root, and red peony to circulate the blood in the upper stomach; and with oyster shell, dragon bone, and five flavors to stabilize the wandering spirit. </p>
<p>It is crucial to add two doses of fresh pig bile into each prescription, as the heat of the lesser yang will surely dry the bile. Immediately, similar substances need to be supplemented to support and stabilize the patient. When the patient takes one dose of medicine, it is as if their spirit returns to its place, forgetting the bitter taste, and they can take ten or more doses, consuming over twenty doses of pig bile. The heat subsides, the body cools, appetite increases, diarrhea halts, and they can finally rise and move a few steps. However, they still feel light as a leaf and cannot endure for long.</p>
<p>I feared that the bitterness of the medicine might be excessive and not suitable for prolonged use, so I reduced the pig bile and the other herbs, adding one qian of angelica and three fen of ginseng, using ginger and jujube as a guide, adjusting the formula over several days until they were completely cured.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>
