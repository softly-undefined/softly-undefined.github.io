<p><strong>Records</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Chronicles of Emperors&quot;:</strong> Fuxi observed the patterns in the sky and the laws on the earth, studied the markings of birds and beasts along with the suitability of the land, drew from the human body and objects around him. Thus, he created writing characters to replace the primitive practice of knotting ropes for communication, and devised the Eight Trigrams to convey the virtues of the divine and to categorize the emotions of all things. This led to the understanding of the six energies and six cavities, the five organs and five elements, the yin and yang of the four seasons, the rise and fall of water and fire, resulting in the manifestation of images. The principles of all illnesses could then be inferred, and he analyzed a hundred herbs to develop nine needles for the rescue of the ailing.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>In &quot;The History of Roads&quot;: Fuxi observed the six qi, examined yin and yang, and applied them to his own body. Thus, the rise and fall of fire and water through the four seasons were given forms, and the principles behind various illnesses were categorized. He then attempted to create treatments using needles to address the ailments of the people, leading them to greater trust. [Note: In ancient times, needles were used, but later generations used a different method. The mountains of Gao have many such needles.]</p>
<p>Supplement from &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;: Shennong used a red whip to hit plants, beginning to taste all herbs and thus establishing medicine. From &quot;The Chronicles of Emperors&quot;: The Flame Emperor, Shennong, grew by the rivers, teaching the world to cultivate grains for food, saving lives and reducing killings. He tasted herbs to declare their medicinal properties, saving lives from misfortunes, which people used daily without knowing. He authored the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; in four volumes.</p>
<p>From &quot;Records of the Search for Spirits&quot;: Shennong wielded a red whip on countless herbs, comprehending their properties of being balanced, poisonous, cold, or warm, and their scents and flavors. He disseminated all grains and thus was honored as the Divine Farmer Emperor.</p>
<p>From &quot;External Records&quot;: In ancient times, when the people fell ill and were ignorant of remedies, the Flame Emperor began to taste herbs and plants, observed their cold, warm, and balanced properties, and discerned the roles of chief, minister, assistant, and guide. In one day, he encountered seventy poisons and transformed them miraculously. Consequently, he authored texts to treat the maladies of the people, marking the beginning of medicine. He further assessed the sweetness and bitterness of springs, guiding the people on what to avoid and seek. As a result, the populace lived in peace and had strong livelihoods, free from premature death, which was beneficial to all under heaven.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>In the &quot;History of the Road,&quot; Shennong asked the Little Boy of Taiyi: &quot;In ancient times, people lived beyond a hundred years, but later generations do not investigate the years determined by heaven, resulting in the blame of untimely death. What breath or essence accounts for this?&quot; The Little Boy replied: &quot;Heaven has nine gates, with the middle path being the best. Thus, he studied the Great Beginning, examined the jade book, ground the shellfish whip, analyzed colors and odors, and tasted herbs and plants to correct their names. He scrutinized their toxicity, marked their dryness and coldness, observed their fears and aversions, discerned their ministerial uses, clarified and corrected them to nourish life and treat illness. In one day, he dealt with seventy poisons, reaching to the essence of breath. There were four hundred diseases recorded, with three hundred sixty-five medicines noted in the &#39;Herbal Classics,&#39; exceeding which would lead to chaos. He commissioned loans for seasonal management of color and pulse, observed harmony and alignment, applied techniques to benefit the world, and people could maintain their lives.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: Ren Shuyi mentions that in Taiyuan, there is a divine cauldron hill and a cauldron used by Shennong to test medicines. Additionally, within Chengyang Mountain, there is a place where Shennong whips medicinal herbs. Shennong is originally known for his connection to herbs, and there is a Ziyang Temple in the mountain where the emperor distinguished medicines.]</p>
<p>In the &quot;Comprehensive Records,&quot; in the Annals of the Three Sovereigns: At the time of the Flame Emperor Shennong, he experimented with a hundred herbs daily, experiencing life and death a hundred times. He obtained three hundred sixty items to correspond with the number of the celestial cycle, which later generations recorded as a book, calling it the &quot;Herbal Classics of Shennong.&quot; He also composed formulas to treat contemporary diseases.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Chronicles of Emperors&quot;: The Yellow Emperor, of the Xiong clan, commanded Lei Gong and Qi Bo to discuss the meridians, addressing eighty-one inquiries for the &quot;Classic of Difficulties.&quot; He taught the use of nine needles, compiling the &quot;Classics of Internal and External Techniques&quot; in eighteen volumes.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br>In the &quot;History of the Roads&quot;: The Yellow Emperor, of the Bear clan, said: In the life of man, one carries the yin and embraces the yang, consumes flavors and is adorned with colors, swayed by cold and heat from outside, while joy and anger surge from within. Misfortunes and early death alternate between rulers and subjects. Hence, one should explore the extremes above and below, examine the five energies, establish the five movements, penetrate the essence of life, record the yin and yang, consulting deeply the teachings of Qi and Lei to create the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; Careful observation of the timing leads to inscribing it on jade tablets to be stored in the chamber of the spirit of orchids. </p>
<p>He explored grains in the granary and commanded Yu to examine the hall of clarity with Bai Bo to investigate the pulse, observing the timing diligently, ensuring comprehensive safety. He ordered Wu to prepare a prescription for medicinal elixirs, overseeing purification and treatment, allowing people to live to their full years. </p>
<p>(Note in &quot;Dao Ji Jing&quot;: Grains refer to the sage of grains, whose practice continues without rest for longevity. Wang Mang usurped the throne, planting five-colored crops in the palace, positioning them according to color, claiming this was the technique of the Yellow Emperor’s sage of grains. &quot;Ling Shu&quot; also discusses this. The &quot;Yellow Emperor&#39;s Original Genesis Canon&quot; mentions: The blood avoids the timing of yin and yang&#39;s vital energies, in the heavenly central positions, also known as the heavenly thieves, particularly avoiding needle moxibustion. &quot;Su Wen&quot;: By diligently observing the timing, the energies align, allowing combinations of color and pulse, leading to comprehensive safety. There are fifty-nine needling points below the stomach for fevers, detailed in &quot;Su Wen&quot;. The Yellow Emperor further inquired about treating ailments, where he commanded Qi Bo to taste a hundred herbs, overseeing medical practice; thus, the canon and herbal texts all originate from this. Therefore, &quot;Jia Yu&quot; states: The Yellow Emperor tasted the herbs and plants.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Tongzhi&quot; Record of the Three Sovereigns:</strong> The Yellow Emperor of the Xuanyuan clan observed the five movements and six energies, and thus composed the questions to Qibo, which is known as the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; Some say that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; was written by later generations, but is based on the Yellow Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;:</strong> In the twenty-first year of Duke Xiang&#39;s reign, during summer, the ruler of Chu sent Fenzi to be the chief administrator, consulting with Shen Shuyu. Shuyu said: &quot;If a nation is filled with favor and the king is weak, then the nation cannot be sustained.&quot; Thus, he excused himself due to illness. As the summer heat intensified, ice appeared beneath the bed. Wearing dense silk robes, he ate little and slept. The ruler of Chu sent a doctor to examine him, who reported: &quot;He is extremely emaciated, but his blood and qi have not stirred.&quot; He then appointed Zi Nan as the chief administrator.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Guo Yu&quot;:</strong> At the meeting of Wen, the Jin people captured Duke Cheng and returned him to Zhou, where he was poisoned by a doctor. Since he did not die, the doctor was not executed. [Note: Duke Cheng relied on Chu and did not serve Jin, and he also killed his younger brother, Shuwu. His minister, Yuan Zhi, reported this to Jin, leading to Wen Gong capturing him. The poison bird is toxic; drinking its venom leads to instant death. It would be better to pay the doctor to dilute the poison, allowing him to survive. The doctor is not punished, for it conceals private malice in administering poison.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>In the &quot;Muwang&quot; chapter of Liezi, it is said that a man named Huazi from Song suffered from a chronic illness causing him to forget. He would forget in the morning what he learned in the evening, forget what he had in the evening by morning, forget how to walk on the road, and forget how to sit in his house. Now, he did not recognize the past, nor did he recognize the present. His entire household was distressed by this. He consulted historians and tried divination, but it yielded no answers; he sought the help of shamans and prayed, but was met with no respite; he approached doctors and sought treatments, but it was futile.</p>
<p>In Lu, there was a Confucian scholar who claimed he could cure him. Huazi&#39;s wife and children asked him to use half of their estate in exchange for a remedy. The scholar said: &quot;This is not something that can be determined by divination, nor through prayer, nor by medicine. I will try to transform his heart and change his thoughts, hoping for a cure.&quot; Thus, he experimented by exposing Huazi to light when he sought clothes, providing food when he was hungry, and seeking brightness when he was in darkness.</p>
<p>The scholar joyfully told Huazi&#39;s children, &quot;The illness can be cured.&quot; However, I will not inform anyone of my secret method; let us keep it private for seven days. Following this, no one knew what he did. After many years of illness, on one morning, it all vanished. Once Huazi regained his senses, he became extremely angry, dismissed his wife, punished his children, and chased away the scholar. The people of Song caught him and questioned him. Huazi said: &quot;I used to forget, obliviously unaware of the existence or non-existence of heaven and earth. Now I have suddenly grasped the past and can remember losses and gains from decades, the sorrows and joys, all the tangled emotions arise within me. I fear that in the future there will be turmoil from losses and gains, sorrows and joys—my heart is like this. Can the momentary forgetfulness be regained?&quot;</p>
<p>Zi Gong heard this and was amazed, reporting it to Confucius. Confucius said, &quot;This is beyond your understanding, isn&#39;t it?&quot; He then instructed Yan Hui to remember it.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br>&quot;The Disciple Gongsun: Confucius was unwell, and Duke Ai sent a physician to examine him. The physician asked, &#39;How is your living situation and diet?&#39; Confucius replied, &#39;In spring, I stay in a thatched hut; in summer, I live in Miyan; in autumn, there is no wind, and in winter, I do not suffer from heat. My food is not lacking, and I do not indulge in drinking.&#39; The physician said, &#39;This is a good doctor indeed.&#39;&quot;<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Records of the Warring States&quot;:</strong> Duke Ling of Wei had close ties with the eunuch Mi Zi Xia, both of whom held the power to influence the ruler. A spy named Tu Zhen reported to the duke, saying: &quot;In the past, I dreamed of you.&quot; The duke asked: &quot;What kind of dream?&quot; The reply was: &quot;I dreamed of the Kitchen God.&quot; The duke became angry and said: &quot;I have heard that dreaming of a ruler is like dreaming of the sun. If you say you dreamed of the Kitchen God, that could be explained, but without explanation, you die.&quot; The reply was: &quot;The sun illuminates the world; nothing can obscure it. But the kitchen is different; if those before block the view, those after cannot see at all. Thus, I doubt there is someone obstructing you.&quot; The duke said: &quot;Good.&quot; Consequently, he dismissed Mi Zi Xia and appointed Si Kong Xun.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;He Guan Zi&quot;:</strong> The three brothers of Bian Que were all skilled in medicine. Duke Wen of Wei asked: &quot;Which of the three brothers is the best?&quot; The reply was: &quot;The eldest brother observes the color and thus does not leave home; the second brother observes the tiniest details and also does not leave the door; Bian Que uses needles to pierce blood vessels and administers poisons, earning fame among the lords.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Spring and Autumn of Wu and Yue&quot;:</strong> Year fifteen of Gou Jian&#39;s plan to attack Wu, he mourned the dead and inquired about the wounded, expressed sorrow for those who lament, and joy for those who celebrate. He called his father, brothers, and siblings, swearing to them: &quot;If the generals are to be spared, let it be reported to me; let the physicians take care of them.&quot;<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>In the &quot;Strategies of the Warring States&quot;: When Jing Ke arrived at Qin, he presented a map of the region of Duhang. As the map was unfolded, his dagger appeared. He then grasped the sleeve of the Qin king with his left hand and held the dagger with his right hand, preparing to strike. Before he could approach, the Qin king was startled and stood up, causing the sleeve to tear; he drew his sword, which was too long for him to wield properly in his chamber. In his panic, the sword was stuck and couldn&#39;t be drawn easily. Jing Ke pursued the Qin king, who ran around a column. The ministers were astonished, caught off guard, and completely lost their composure. According to Qin law, the ministers who attended the throne were not permitted to carry weapons; those in the inner court held weapons, but they were positioned below the throne and could not act without a decree. In that urgent moment, there was no time to summon soldiers, which allowed Jing Ke to pursue the Qin king without being attacked effectively; instead, they attempted to grab him with their hands. At that time, the physician Xia Wuqie used his medicine pouch to assist Jing Ke. The Qin king was running around the column in a state of panic and didn’t know what to do. Those around him shouted: &quot;The king is unarmed! The king is unarmed!&quot; He then drew his sword and struck Jing Ke, injuring his left thigh. Jing Ke was incapacitated and tried to use his dagger to strike the Qin king, but missed and hit the column instead. The Qin king retaliated, inflicting eight wounds upon Jing Ke. Realizing that his plan had failed, Jing Ke leaned against the column, laughed, and scornfully said: &quot;The reason this mission did not succeed is that I aimed to force a situation and had to agree to a contract in order to reward the crown prince.&quot; As those around him advanced, they executed Jing Ke. The Qin king, feeling dizzy for a long time, eventually awarded titles and rewards to the ministers and those present, with each receiving varying honors, and granted Xia Wuqie two hundred taels of gold, saying: &quot;Wuqie loves me, for he used his medicine pouch to assist Jing Ke.&quot;<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br>In the Records of the Grand Historian, there is a passage about Emperor Gao. When he was faced with a calamity, he was struck by a stray arrow and fell ill while traveling. His illness was severe, and Empress Lu welcomed a skilled physician. When the physician entered to see him, Gao asked about his condition. The physician replied, &quot;The illness can be treated.&quot; Emperor Gao then scornfully berated him, saying, &quot;I, a commoner, took up a three-foot sword to seize the realm; is this not Heaven&#39;s decree? Life and death are in the hands of Heaven; what good is even Bian Que?&quot; He refused to allow treatment and dismissed the physician, bestowing him with fifty pounds of gold.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Kuli Lie Zhuan:</strong> Yi Zong, a man from Hedong, in his youth engaged in banditry with Zhang Cgong. Zong had a sister, who, through her medical skills, gained favor with the Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager asked, &quot;Do you have any sons or brothers in official positions?&quot; The sister replied, &quot;I have a brother who is unworthy, he cannot serve.&quot; The Empress Dowager then informed the emperor, and appointed Yi Zong’s brother Zong as a mid-level official, assigning him to the position of magistrate of Shangdang County.</p>
<p><strong>Wanshi Zhang Shu Lie Zhuan:</strong> The Langzhong Ling, Zhou Wen, whose name was Ren, originally from Rencheng, was recognized for his medical skills. When Emperor Jing was crown prince, he appointed him as a gentleman attendant.</p>
<p><strong>Han Shu Xu Huanghou Zhuan:</strong> Lady Huo, desiring to elevate her youngest daughter, found no way. The following year, when Empress Xu fell ill during her pregnancy, the court physician Chunyu Yan, favored by the Huo family, entered the palace to attend to the empress&#39;s illness. Yan was rewarded and appointed as a palace guard, asked to facilitate a meeting with Lady Huo on behalf of the empress. Yan reported this to Xian. Xian then harbored ulterior motives and addressed Yan, saying, &quot;If you could favor me in this matter, I too wish to repay you, is that acceptable?&quot; Yan replied, &quot;What you say is entirely appropriate.&quot; Xian continued, &quot;The general has always favored my youngest daughter, wanting to elevate her through marriage, I wish to entrust this matter to you.&quot; Yan asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Xian explained, &quot;Once a woman is past nursing, it is a matter of life and death. Now the empress is due to give birth, it would be possible to poison her and have my daughter become the empress instead.&quot;<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br>If we are fortunate to succeed, wealth and honor will be shared with the young lord. Yan said: For medical treatment, one must first taste; how could that be? Xian replied: It is for the young lord to decide. The general commands the world; who would dare to speak? It is a matter of urgency and caution, fearing that the young lord may not be interested. After a long time, Yan said: I wish to do my utmost. He ground the aconite and brought it into the Longding Palace. After the queen&#39;s dismissal, Yan took the aconite and mixed it with the great medicine and large pills to administer to the queen. After a while, she said: My head is dizzy; is there no poison in the medicine? He replied: There is none. However, she became increasingly distressed and collapsed. Yan came out and saw Xian; they inquired about each other but did not dare to express gratitude to Yan heavily. Later, there were reports accusing physicians who attended the sick without propriety, all were arrested and sent to the Zhao prison for admonition. Xian, fearing the urgency of the situation, mentioned this to Guang. He then said: Since the plan has failed, do not let officials pressure Yan. Guang was startled and remained silent. Afterward, a report concluded that Yan should not be questioned.</p>
<p>From the &quot;Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital&quot;: The wife of Huo Guang bequeathed to Yan twenty-four pieces of purple peach brocade and twenty-five pieces of scatter flower silk. The silk came from the family of Chen Baoguang of Julu. The wife of Baoguang passed on the technique; Huo Xian summoned them to make it, using one hundred and twenty tweezers, taking sixty days to produce one piece, each piece worth ten thousand coins. Furthermore, he provided one gem-engraving instrument, one hundred pieces of green silk, one million coins, and one hundred taels of gold to establish a residence, with countless servants. Yan still complained: What good have I done for you to repay me like this?<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Zhongli Yi&#39;s Biography&quot;</strong>: Huang Dang was the governor of Kuaiji. In the fourteenth year of Jianwu, a severe plague struck Wu, and he was appointed as the district officer to oversee postal services. He then concealed himself, without a cap, and personally visited the homes of the infected, providing them with medicine. He prayed and offered sacrifices at the temples for the people, summoning a hundred physicians to combine herbal remedies. Fearing that young or incompetent doctors might harm the people with toxic doses, he first tested the medicines on himself before administering them. He cared for over four thousand patients, all of whom recovered. Later, when the governor went out, the people, suffering from disasters, clung to his carriage in tears, saying: &quot;There is no need for the governor to come out; if we have Officer Zhong, all the people will be saved.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Tongzhi&quot; concerning Xu Yang</strong>: Yang, styled Weijun, was from Pingyu in Runan and had an early interest in numerology. When Wang Mang was in power, he summoned Yang as an attendant and gradually promoted him to command the army at Jiuquan. When Mang usurped the throne, Yang changed his name to become a wizard and physician, fleeing to another region. When Mang was defeated, he returned to his hometown.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Eastern View of Han History&quot;</strong>: Deng Xun was humble and forgiving, treating subordinates without regard for status, welcoming friends as if they were his own children, and correcting faults with encouragement. The court physician Pi Xun, returning from a hunt in the Upper Forest, stayed overnight at the palace gate and suffered from a cold-related illness. At that time, Xun was attending to his duties when he heard Xun&#39;s distress. He got up to inquire. Xun said: &quot;I wish to have fire to warm my back.&quot; Xun went to the main palace gate seeking fire but could not find any; he then breathed on Xun&#39;s back with his mouth. He called others of the same group to join him in this effort, and by morning he had fully recovered.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Records of the Lost&quot;</strong>: Sun He cherished Lady Deng, and often kept her on his lap. Under the moonlight, as he danced with a water jade ruyi, he accidentally injured her cheek, causing blood to stain her clothes, leaving her in great distress. He licked her wound and commanded the court physician to prepare medicine. The physician said, &quot;If you acquire the marrow of a white otter, mixed with jade and amber dust, it will eradicate this mark.&quot; He spent a hundred gold pieces to obtain these, and thus ordered the salve to be made. The physician mistakenly included too much amber, resulting in red spots like vermilion. Upon closer inspection, it only enhanced her beauty.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Book of the Rise of Jin&quot;</strong>: Cheng Ju served as the chief imperial physician. When Emperor Wu initially received Wei Shen, he changed the era name to Taishi, and Ju presented a pheasant-feather cloak. The emperor, seeing it as an unusual craft and attire forbidden by court etiquette, burned it in front of the palace. Cheng, grateful for his medical skills, was allowed to enter and exit the restricted areas. Because of Lady Jia, he prepared a combination of ba dou (kusha) and apricot kernel pills, which harmed the sorrowful Crown Prince, leading to his execution.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Essentials of the Yuan&quot;</strong>: In the winter of the ninth year of Yuan Kang, on the day of Renxu, Jia Shuren killed the Crown Prince. Xu Chuan states the Crown Prince&#39;s name was Yu, and initially, Lady Jia ordered the physician Cheng Ju to prepare the ba dou pills, causing the Crown Prince to take them and die.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Book of Jin&quot;</strong>: The biography of King Jian of Qi, Min Wang Ji: Ji, styled Jingzhi, was the son of King You. He was known for his kindness and generosity, embodying his father&#39;s virtues. When his father fell ill, Emperor Wu did not believe it, sending physicians for diagnosis, all of whom reported no illness. Upon his father&#39;s death, Ji lamented, alleging that his father had been deceived by the physicians, leading to their immediate execution by imperial decree.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br>Yan Han Zhuan: Brother Han fell ill in Jiangning and sought treatment on his own, but died at the physician&#39;s home. His family, upon mourning, found that the mourning banner was entangled around a tree and could not be untied. The mourners stumbled and fell. He, while still speaking, said: &quot;I have not yet fulfilled my lifespan; it was just too much medicine that harmed my internal organs. I am about to be revived, so please do not bury me.&quot; His parents complied, and they opened the coffin. Indeed, he showed signs of life; he scraped the coffin with his hand, and his fingers were all injured, yet his breath was very faint, and life and death were indistinguishable. Nourishment was provided, but even after several months, he could not speak. What he needed for food and drink, he entrusted to dreams. After thirteen years, he ultimately did not rise.</p>
<p>Wang Wei Zhuan in the Book of Song: Wei, styled Jingyuan, was a native of Lingyi in Langya. In his youth, he loved learning and understood everything thoroughly. His younger brother Sengqian fell ill, and Wei personally attended to his treatment. However, Sengqian took medicine in excess and ultimately passed away. Wei felt deep self-blame and fell ill himself, unable to treat again. Grieving for Sengqian, he could not be consoled and wrote to the spirit: &quot;I was just wanting to cultivate the forest and marsh to extend my years. What sin have I committed? Seeing this untimely death by my hand brings me pain and hatred. I have always loved medicine, yet I did not allow my disciple to be whole; furthermore, I did not think thoroughly enough, resulting in wrongful errors. Thinking of this one matter brings me particular grief. What can I do about this pain? What about my guilt?&quot; Four weeks after Sengqian&#39;s death, Wei also passed away.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br>Liu Huaishen&#39;s Biography: The emperor favored Concubine Yin, who passed away. After her burial, he often mourned at her grave along with the officials; he also had the physician Yang Zhi cry for the Yin family, and Zhi wept as well. On another day, someone asked, “How did you come to have such urgent tears, Zhi?” Zhi, who had recently lost his beloved concubine, replied, “I was weeping for my deceased wife.” Zhi was known for his humor and ability to make jokes, which the emperor enjoyed.</p>
<p>The Book of Liang, Ancestral Records: Ancestral Zuo, named Yi, was the seventh son of Gao Ancestral. At birth, he suffered from an eye condition; Gao Ancestral intended to treat it, but as a result, he became blind in one eye.</p>
<p>The Book of Wei, Transmission of the Western Regions: In the country of Yuebian, the True Lord sent envoys for nine years to offer tributes and also sent sorcerers, claiming they could cut people&#39;s throats causing blood to flow, and strike a person&#39;s head causing the bones to cave in, resulting in a loss of blood, whether several liters or a bucket full. They would then use herbal medicine to fill the person&#39;s mouth, instructing them to chew and swallow it, and soon the blood would stop, with wounds healing in a month without scars. Ancestral Zuo, doubting its authenticity, had death row inmates test it, and it was confirmed. They claimed that such herbs existed on all of China’s famous mountains, leading him to bring in practitioners of the technique and treat them well.</p>
<p>The Record of Uncommon Stories: At the end of the Sui dynasty, Gao Kaidao was shot with an arrow that penetrated his bone, and when he ordered a physician to remove it, the physician was unable to do so. Kaidao asked him, who replied, “I fear the king&#39;s pain.” Kaidao then executed him and summoned another physician, who claimed, “I can remove it.” He used a small axe to press down on the wound&#39;s edge, drove a small stick two inches into the bone, and pulled it out with a pair of pliers. Kaidao remained calm while drinking and eating. He awarded the physician with three hundred bolts of silk, but later, he was killed by General Zhang Jinshu.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br>&quot;In the &#39;Record of Conversations&#39;: Han the Assistant Minister Gao was afflicted with a small sore, and he asked the doctor to apply an ointment, but the medicine did not absorb. When the Duke inquired, the doctor replied, &#39;It is cold, and the ointment is hard.&#39;</p>
<p>In the &#39;Casual Talks of the Jade Hall&#39;: During the prosperous days in Chang&#39;an, there was a family selling herbal medicines in the western market. They used only a few common ingredients, did not inquire about illnesses, and simply charged a hundred wen for one dose, which could cure a thousand kinds of ailments upon consumption. They usually had a large pot in a spacious home, grinding and cooking day and night, unable to keep up with the demand. People came from near and far to purchase it, and the market was bustling, as even during the months of summer, there were those who had not yet received their remedies. They profited greatly. </p>
<p>At that time, there was a patient named Tian Lingzi, and he had summoned every doctor in the land, even the royal physician under summons, but no one could ascertain his ailment. Suddenly, a friend advised Tian, saying, &#39;Why not try the herbal medicine from the western market?&#39; Lingzi replied, &#39;Indeed.&#39; He then sent a servant promptly to fetch it. The servant secured the medicine and hurried back, but as he approached the neighborhood, his horse stumbled and fell. The servant, fearing the master’s wrath and unable to return for more, went to a dye shop and begged for a bottle from the dye vat, deceiving the owner. After consuming it, Lingzi&#39;s illness was immediately cured. Tian only knew that he was healed and did not understand where the remedy had come from, thus he compensated the herbalist handsomely, and the reputation of the herbal medicine family rose. There had also been a physician named Zhang from Ye in recent years who, similarly, accumulated a vast stock and became famous, eventually taken back by the foreign king.&quot;<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Records of Imperial Court Submissions&quot;:</strong> Bi Yan, the son of a merchant, advanced through the ranks in the civil service examinations. Du Cong served as the military governor of Huainan and set up his tent there. He initially regulated the salt trade and was well-versed in literature, handling matters without delay. At the Hanlin Academy, he received exceptional favor from the emperor and was allowed to be considered for the prime minister role, which made him deeply resented by the prime minister Linghu Tao. After moving from Binning to Fengtian, Zhao Yi, and the North Gate, all these actions were to slow down Tao’s plans for the prime minister position. Yan attempted to forge a bond with Tao by acquiring a rare beauty at the North Gate, someone not easily found in the mortal world. Decorated in fine clothing, she was sent to be presented to Tao. Upon seeing her, Tao’s heart was stirred and he told his son, &quot;Such a beauty will definitely bring harm.&quot; Yan was not favored by the Taiyuan family; now with this bait, they aim to benefit the clan. After just one meeting, she was sent away. A special envoy was afraid to return, waiting for Yan&#39;s instructions. Yan then poured out his blood in a letter to Tao, but Tao ultimately rejected the proposal and ordered the local officials to trade her. </p>
<p>At the eastern pavilion, Dr. Li Yuanbo, favored by the emperor, was entrusted with seventy thousand cash for his home and then made to serve in the main hall. Within a month, he had won the favor of the emperor, and he was subsequently presented to the emperor. Upon seeing him, the emperor was enchanted, and Li&#39;s favor surpassed that of all the palace&#39;s residents. Yuanbo offered the emperor a concoction of cinnabar to gain favor, which led to the emperor suffering from an illness, all of which was Li Yuanbo&#39;s fault. When Emperor Yi Zong ascended the throne, Li Yuanbo, alongside the hermit Wang Yue and the Taoist Yu Zizhi, were executed in the marketplace.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Book of the Banana&quot;</strong>: During the Tang dynasty, Li Bozhen received a medical prescription stating: &quot;One piece of white gold is prepared for the need of orange-yellow.&quot; Initially, I did not understand its meaning, but upon reading &quot;Continued Sayings of the World,&quot; I found: &quot;The loquat is yellow, and the doctor is busy; the orange is yellow, and the doctor hides.&quot; So I realized it was due to the time.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Supplement to National History&quot;</strong>: Bai Cen once met an unusual person who shared a formula with him, which proved to be fully effective. Cen showcased it for profit but later became a minor general in Huainan. The governor Gao Shi forcibly took his formula, but it did not work very well. Cen eventually went to Jiujiang, where he was eaten by a tiger. The courier found the true prescription in his bag and delivered it, writing it down for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Records of Wild Travels&quot;</strong>: During the Five Dynasties, Zhu Jin served Yang Xingmi and once suffered from a sore. The doctor was fearful upon examining him. Jin said: &quot;Just treat it; I am not one who dies from illness.&quot; When Xu Wen and his son seized power, Jin plotted to eliminate them but was killed instead and buried at the north gate of Guangling. At that time, many people were afflicted by malaria, taking soil from Jin&#39;s grave and mixing it with water to drink, which would instantly cure them. He knew he would not die from illness in life, yet after death, the soil from his grave could still heal others; indeed, he was a remarkable person.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>From &quot;History of Liao,&quot; Biography of Yelü Shucheng: Initially, the Khitan doctors were not well-versed in pulse diagnosis and medicinal prescriptions. The emperor ordered Shucheng to translate books on pulse diagnosis for wide circulation. From this point on, everyone became proficient, and even various clans understood medical practices.</p>
<p>From &quot;History of Song,&quot; Biography of the Second Daughter of Emperor Xiaozong: The Princess of Changjia was granted the title of Shuo Ren in the twenty-fourth year of Shaoxing and promoted to the title of Yongjia District Princess. She passed away in the thirty-second year. The edict designated the medical officials, such as Li Shike and others, to her attendants. During Xiaozong&#39;s time in the Eastern Palace, he reported that his young daughter was frequently ill and that the physicians should not be blamed, thus the matter was put to rest.</p>
<p>From &quot;Records of Talks by the Yan in Mianshui&quot;: During the reign of Xiangfu, some princes, due to illness, sought treatment from doctors with success and requested exemptions from far-off districts. Emperor Zhenzong remarked that having a physician attend to a district was not a matter of good governance but could be rewarded generously. He also instructed the chancellor to convey this intention.</p>
<p>From &quot;Talks Garden&quot;: There is a saying in the capital: &quot;When a death is pronounced by the physician, the edict for burial can ruin a family.&quot; This stems from the sent physicians who say, &quot;I have come under imperial decree; the prescription must be submitted with adjustments in order,&quot; often forcing patients to take medication until death ensues. For families under such edicts, they are required to wash their hands and wear specific cloths; three pieces each in white for individuals, with other items being customary. During the Yuanyou period, Duke Han Kang suffered from an illness, and upon the physician&#39;s observation, he was given a golden liquid pill. Although he could eat and drink for a while, the old duke&#39;s vital energy was diminished, unable to withstand external factors, leading to his death. The court dispatched envoys to inquire about subsequent matters, and due to confusion, an edict for burial was mistakenly promised, which later led to his sons and nephews distancing themselves from it.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>Teng Yuanfa said: A good physician advises to use the white character herbs from the Materia Medica, which have been proven effective. Su Zirong remarked that the black characters are later additions by others.</p>
<p>In &quot;Tan Pu&quot;: Xu Junping, a native of Jinling, personally witnessed Jing Gong&#39;s illness change. He alone slept in the same bed as a physician. Jing Gong suddenly awoke and said: &quot;Just now I dreamed of standing together with Wang Yuyu, both without headgear, on the same platform.&quot; Shortly thereafter, he passed away, which is quite strange.</p>
<p>In &quot;Zhou Mie Lu&quot;: Wang Wengong from the east of the state had a serious illness. The True Temple repeatedly sent physicians to check on him, but they could not find a solution, so they returned after six months like this. One day, the Wang family announced his death, and the physicians said to others: &quot;For half a year, there was an unbreakable bond with a medicine, yet everyone is now separated.&quot;</p>
<p>In &quot;Mengxi Bitan&quot;: Li Yuqing, a professor in the National Academy, was knowledgeable about politics and firm in discarding evils. Malefactors and corrupt officials feared him like a deity. In his later years, he suffered from a severe illness. There were many local physicians known for their malice, and they often feared exposure by Yuqing. Because of his condition, they administered toxic medicines, causing severe leakage, which endangered his life. Yuqing saw through their scheming, had someone support him to sit and handle affairs, then summoned the malicious physician and killed him with a staff. After that, he went back to sleep and died before he could settle on the mat. He was buried on Hengshan. Even to this day, people fear him, and those who pass by his grave must lower themselves. Those suffering from fever would take soil from his grave and place it on their beds, and it would relieve their symptoms, demonstrating the high regard and fear in which he is held.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br>&quot;Records of Escaping Summer&quot;: Su Zizhan delighted in discussing immortals, and later came to admire Yao Danyuan, whom he thought to be a reincarnation of Li Taibai, dedicating dozens of poems to him. Yao was originally the son of the wealthy Wang family in the capital, but was disdained for his lack of virtue and was driven away by his father to serve a Daoist priest at the Jianlong Temple. He was naturally intelligent and read extensively from the Daoist canon, being able to recite it all. He also acquired many formulas and elixirs, largely speaking grandly and crafting poems filled with wild and unconventional phrases, enabling him to gain recognition. He floated through Huainan, often changing his name; at first, Zizhan was unable to distinguish him. Later, he reverted to his surname and named himself Wang Shi. During the Chongning period, when I was in the capital, he had already risen to the position of medical officer through his skills. He frequented the household of Duke Cai Lu, often engaging in strange medical practices. I still recall that he spoke with Duke Lu about Zizhan&#39;s matters, claiming that he could describe the palaces of the immortals on the sea, making them visible in the sky. Duke Cai also trusted him. When arranging matters in Chuzhou, Liang Shicheng sought Zizhan&#39;s letters and recommended his skills. At the end of the Xuān Hé period, he again became a Daoist priest, named Yuancheng. He vehemently attacked Lin Lingsu, who poisoned him, causing him to vomit blood and die.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Records of Dongpo&quot;:</strong> Pang Anchang was a physician, not focused on profit. When he obtained ancient books and paintings, he could not contain his joy. The Daoist from Jiujiang had mastered some of his techniques and used them in collaboration with me. Unable to repay him, I merely wrote a few pieces in running script. I also told him, &quot;This is the story of Anchang; it must not be neglected.&quot; When Shen Liaozu fell ill, he sought the Daoist for treatment, but feeling he had no money and being poor at writing, he urgently asked me for help. I jokingly said, &quot;You, with your bright literary talent, why don&#39;t you compose a couple of poems?&quot; The two gentlemen, Pang and Hu, often visited me, and soon they would seek me out at the dry fish shop.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Records from the Mo Zhuang&quot;:</strong> Duan Chengwu was highly skilled in medicine, yet the nobility complained that he did not properly manage his selections for rewards. He resided in Yixing, and only those with power could compel his attention. Minister Zhai Gongxun, residing in Changshu, wished to see him, so he entrusted an invitation through the governor of Pingjiang, Liang Zhongmo. Finally, he came. One day, a wealthy man from Pingjiang fell ill and sought Duan&#39;s help. Duan said, &quot;This illness can be cured with just a few doses of decoction, but it requires no less than five hundred or a thousand as compensation.&quot; The family initially agreed to half of that, but Duan brushed off his coat and left. Eventually, they complied, offering fifty strings as the fee for medicine. Duan then sought more, and the offer increased to a hundred strings before he was willing to dispense the medicine. As he had said, it worked, and he returned home with his earnings. On the way back, he had a dream of a figure in red garments who said, &quot;The Supreme Deity has chosen you as a physician, yet you take bribes, showing no heart for helping others.&quot; He commanded that he be beaten on the back twenty times, and his attendants obeyed. Upon waking, he still felt pain in his back. People examined it and found bruises; shortly after returning home, he died.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br>In &quot;The Qingbo Magazine&quot;: Hui once heard his father&#39;s friend Xu Zhikang discuss the essence of pulse diagnosis, claiming that it could predict a person&#39;s fortune or misfortune. During the era of peace, the monk Zhi Yuan from the capital diagnosed the pulse of Wang Jinggong and said that he would surely have joy from a child passing the highest exams. At that time, Wang Yuyu was present and deeply disagreed. The following year, the prediction indeed came true as the child passed the exams. Because of this, Zhi Yuan boasted of his accuracy and approached Wang for a written commendation as a favor. Wang wrote: &quot;Master Zhi Yuan remarkably diagnosed my father&#39;s pulse, knowing that his son would achieve fame; however, Wang Chengzhi doubted that such a thing was possible in ancient times. Zhi Yuan replied: &#39;In the past, the physician He of Qin diagnosed the pulse of the Duke of Jin and knew that his good minister would die. If the fate of a good minister could be discerned through the pulse of the Duke of Jin, then why would it be surprising to know about a son through the father?&#39; The letter was roughly as such.&quot; Xu added: &quot;This is not Wang Jinggong&#39;s writing; rather, it is merely his disciple exploiting the master&#39;s renown to boast and promote his own practice.&quot;<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>In the &quot;Cheng History&quot;: Yu Wen Zhonghui was at the central office when I happened to see him. We discussed the principles of the five elements and engaged in free conversation. There was a guest present who casually mentioned: &quot;The tattoo doctor Wang Jing, after being whipped in the city yesterday, returned from afar. Now that he’s back, he has resumed his previous duties and briefly mentioned old matters. He claimed he had never been beaten, and when he bared his back to show someone, it was intact and blemish-free. I initially did not understand how this was possible, but later I saw another doctor who said that all the beatings left scars, and only when the skin was bitten at first and then treated with gold leaf would the scar dissolve immediately, suggesting a conflict between the natures of metal and wood.&quot; Zhonghui laughed and said: &quot;In ancient times, there was someone who sold a medicine to cure callused feet in the market, and he would put up a sign at his door that read: &#39;For the Emperor&#39;s service.&#39; Others laughed at the insignificance of this claim, and it reached the higher authorities who summoned and punished him, but later pardoned his foolishness. After he went out, he added four more words: &#39;Previously announced for a call.&#39; Is this not in a similar vein? Who will you sell this to?&quot; The guest also laughed but did not dare to respond.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>At that time, Zhonghui had not yet recognized Jing. Two years later, I was in the village and heard that Zhonghui had not risen, and I cried for his position. When the people from the capital arrived, it was said: Jing had indeed used purging poisons to treat his foot ailment, leading to great misfortune. The court learned of this and ordered the palace where Jing had returned to be searched, sparing him from punishment and exiling him to Yongxing.</p>
<p>I then remembered when I was in the capital, that Fu, the author, and Yao, the official, both took Jing’s medicine and witnessed his demise. The author did not raise his hands or feet and still advanced with one cut of the guillotine, not escaping with his mouth before he passed away. One day, I was following the class of Jingling, and saw the official Yao at the gate of the hall, who said: &quot;The phlegm and illness are newly healed.&quot; He had truly suffered greatly. He then said: &quot;The royal physician actually cured me, the ailment is gone; several dou of phlegm were expelled. Now I just feel fatigued; otherwise, I am well.&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, I was privately worried, thinking it might not be able to withstand it. Within a week, he indeed passed away. Alas! How harmful is medicine like this! Reflecting on past words, I weep for him and record the end, mourning for his mediocrity.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br>In my youthful years, I entered Fujian and passed through Fuzhou, where I heard of a physician known as the Black Tiger King, who was wealthy and influential in the county. I inquired about him, and learned that he was a descendant of a family with a past reputation. His grandfather had lived in the capital and named himself after the Black Tiger Pill, thus the family was called the Black Tiger King. As for the present generation, they found favor with Emperor Gaozong, accumulating positions and remaining in service, well-regarded throughout the nation as a physician. Even when they faced demotion, their title still held allure.</p>
<p>Initially, Qin Hui held power but had not yet made himself prominent. He significantly bribed those close to the Emperor to secure his favor, while this family maintained a genuine relationship with him. At the height of his power, their influence rivaled that of Qin Hui, and they openly displayed their might without concern for lower-ranking officials. Many generals shared familial ties with the emperor and, having the advantage in military matters, sought to connect with the King of Han, first expressing a desire to become his adopted son. Consequently, they led armies from Jinling, inspiring many to follow suit without raising suspicion.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br>The cypress desired to elevate its kindred, not speaking of it itself, but frequently requesting to advance the faction of the former leader with the court. The former leader, taking advantage of the situation, also petitioned on the cypress&#39;s behalf. As the sons arrived at the extended hall, gold and purple filled the entrance, obscured by bribes and favors, while the market grew rich, oppressing the children of commoners to serve as concubines; the crimes were too numerous to record, yet under the protection of the city and society, none dared speak out for thirty years. </p>
<p>In the sixth month of the Xin Si year of Shaoxing, the Sichuan man Du Xinlao was appointed to the Southern Platform, planning to strike but had not yet launched an attack. At the same time, border conflicts arose; the former leader first arranged treasures to flee to the south, causing unrest in the capital. The emperor heard of this and was displeased. Liu Wuzhong, the general of Jingkou, proposed a preemptive strike, advocating for military action. The emperor&#39;s thoughts remained hesitant and indecisive, while he himself wished to respond with force. The former leader, naturally timid, still hoped for the firm peace to secure his safety, and thus he subtly remarked to the emperor: the border regions had no real issues; it was merely new officials eager to display their military prowess for credit. If they were to execute one or two people, peace could be restored.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>The emperor did not respond, and Xu said to the attendant, &quot;Does he want me to execute Liu Qi?&quot; At that time, those who had been obstructed and unable to act were gradually influenced by it. Jin Liang demanded that our ministers send Xu Yi and Zhang Lun on an envoy mission. Liang used improper means and sent the advisor Han Rujia to stop them at Xuyi, and ordered them to send what was requested. When the memorial reached the emperor, he happened to be in the pavilion of Consort Liu, about to take a break from his meal. The consort was puzzled and inquired about it from the attendants, learning the reason. She proceeded to explain with broad examples, which somewhat corresponded with earlier discussions. The emperor was greatly shocked and asked, &quot;How did you come to know this?&quot; The consort could not conceal it and answered with all she had heard, which only intensified his anger. On Dingwei day, an edict was issued for the consort to return to her separate residence. Shen Lao subsequently submitted a memorial listing her ten offenses. Initially, when he read it, his face still showed displeasure. Shen Lao knocked on the platform and said, &quot;As I enforce the law for Your Majesty, I cannot overlook even a physician; I would rather die than step back.&quot; He still did not grant permission.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>Due to secret discussions among outsiders regarding Ji Xian, claiming he had benefited from unorthodox methods, I feared that slander would arise, and I could not bear to listen. The Emperor began to change color and nodded in acknowledgment. He dismissed the court and ordered a proclamation stating: &quot;I, with great benevolence, have granted you favor; thus, you have benefited. Such words as these will not allow you to see me again. Within three days, you shall have provisions for your own planning!&quot; On the day of Xin Hai, he commanded Ji Xian to reside in Fuzhou, with his descendants&#39; properties in the capital confiscated by the state; the strong servants and those sold off were allowed to be traded freely. After this order, there was great joy both inside and outside the court. Ji Xian had hidden many possessions and moved them far away, so even with confiscation, his wealth was not harmed. To this day, his former residence, adorned with magnificent beams and intricately carved eaves, is still called a grand estate. As his descendants spread apart, they could no longer sustain themselves. Some said his downfall came because he did not adhere to the proper way and thus was justly met with ruin. Zhao Xingzhi&#39;s &quot;Records of the Restoration&quot; meticulously details the beginnings and ends of Ji Xian, incorporating what he had heard about these events.</p>
<p>In &quot;Miscellaneous Records of Gui Xin&quot;: There were two physicians by the name Wang: Wang Jixian, the national physician during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, who later, for offering ineffective medicines at the De Shou Palace, was assigned to Fuzhou. Wang Jing was also of the same time as Ji Xian, serving in succession; later, while treating De Shou&#39;s illness, he prescribed cooling medicines but faced difficulties, ultimately returning home. The so-called imperial physician Wang Chengxuan refers to him.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br>In the &quot;History of Jin,&quot; the biography of Cheng Hui: Hui was appointed as a minister and was fond of eclectic knowledge, especially in discussing medicine. From Liu Shou-zhen of Hejian, he often used cool medicines. A prodigy who had added years to his life at a young age was summoned by Hui, who wrote the four characters &quot;medicine is not trifling.&quot; The prodigy mistyped a character, changing it to &quot;相&quot; (xiāng). Hui felt quite ashamed, and people said he had hit upon his illness.</p>
<p>In &quot;Records from the Wild,&quot; it is said: Duke Wei of Xu suffered from severe boils and the emperor visited him several times. A large gathering of doctors treated him for a long time but his condition showed little improvement. The emperor suddenly granted him a meal, and the duke wept as he ate it, secretly instructing the physicians to flee. Not long after, he passed away, and the news was quickly reported to the emperor. The emperor, in disarray, mourned and rushed to the duke&#39;s residence, commanding the execution of the physicians. The duke’s wife wept greatly, and upon coming out to pay her respects to the emperor, he comforted her, saying: &quot;Sister, do not worry for the future; I will take care of it.&quot; He then made arrangements for the aftermath and departed.</p>
<p>In &quot;Records of the Golden Terrace&quot;: Dai Yuanli of Jinhua was a renowned doctor at the beginning of the Jin dynasty. He was often summoned to Nanjing, where he visited a family of physicians. They welcomed him at their door and were quite busy responding to inquiries. Yuanli felt that their understanding must be profound, so he observed them closely. The prescriptions and medicines they prepared were all ordinary; he found this puzzling and visited them repeatedly. One day, someone sought medicine, and after leaving, Yuanli chased after him and advised: &quot;When preparing, add a piece of tin.&quot; The man waved him off. Yuanli was greatly surprised. Reflecting that no one adds tin when preparing medicine, he asked and was told: &quot;This is an ancient recipe.&quot; Yuanli found the source of this knowledge and it turned out to be just the character for syrup. He urgently corrected it. Alas! How can physicians, who cannot distinguish between syrup and tin, not be cautious in their practice?<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br>&quot;Talks of Chang&#39;an&quot;: It was customary in the Imperial Medical Academy that on the Dragon Boat Festival, officials would go to Nanhai to catch toads, prepare oil from them, and make purple gold ingots. One person made a grand affair of it, preparing drums, flutes, and banners, making a great din on the way. Someone mocked this in a poem saying: &quot;Shaking off authority, I leave Fengcheng, surrounded by drums and flags, the vibrant banners shining. Entering the forest like a fierce tiger, I catch a toad and poke out its eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>In the common folk, there were women skilled in medicine and pulse diagnosis, chosen from various departments to serve under the Imperial Medical Bureau. Those selected were honored with royal appointments, and many women took pride in this, calling them &quot;medicinal mothers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the Dust&quot;: A famous doctor was about to enter Shu when he saw a man carrying firewood, sweating profusely while bathing in the river. The doctor said: &quot;This man will surely die,&quot; but hurried to save him. The man went into an inn, took garlic, minced it finely, poured hot water over it, ate it, and sweated profusely like rain. The doctor remarked: &quot;Even the poor know of medicine; what about the rich and noble?&quot; Thus, he did not enter Shu.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Fei Xue Record&quot;: It is not advisable to consume wood frogs. A man from the Su family had two sons, both deeply loved, indulging them in their eating. They developed a chronic affliction. The father received a prescription that involved cooking wood frogs with pork. The younger son died that night, and the elder died the next day. The fool was careless, easily believing in false remedies, leading to the deaths of his two sons; how tragic! A friend, Ma Junwen, truly obtained a collection of medical prescriptions, which also included this prescription, thus noting this incident as a caution on the left. This is one aspect of benevolence.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br>A boy had a sore on his head, and when someone applied medicine to it, the boy&#39;s head became unbearably itchy. He scratched until it bled and eventually struck his head against a post. By evening, he died. The medicine contained arsenic, which harms a person when it comes into contact with blood. I heard this from Wen Cheng.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Diary of Mountain Springs&quot;: There was a man named Li, living outside the gate of Yugan. He was skilled in commerce and daily sold spleen-nourishing pills in the market. He once hung a large sign saying, &quot;If the cloves and sandalwood are not mixed, heaven will strike and the earth will be destroyed.&quot; He had two servant girls to assist him in preparing the medicine. One day, Li got drunk and drowned in the river. His family was unaware, but he did not return home for several days, prompting them to send trusted friends to search for him, but there was no trace. When the officials investigated, some reported his family, who hurriedly went to the site and found his body in a state of decay, only able to identify it with great difficulty. They wished to wash it but it was too late. Thus, they buried him in a place with piles of grass and erected a wooden sign at the grave that said: &quot;The Grave of Doctor Li, the Merchant of Medicine.&quot; Someone later wrote on the back of the sign: &quot;Li, the Merchant of Medicine, robust and discerning in trade. One day, heaven granted him a report, and he drowned in the Eastern Canal.&quot; Soon after, the family&#39;s finances deteriorated. His wife sent away the two servant girls, abandoned their home, and took her two children to serve others. Someone asked her, &quot;Your husband was not negligent in his work; surely heaven should favor him. Why such harsh retribution?&quot; On another day, her later husband got her drunk and questioned her. She replied, &quot;The two servant girls I sent away were entrusted to the care of my late husband, one named Sandalwood and the other named Clove, but in truth, neither medicine was used. Thus, he received this punishment.&quot;<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Miscellaneous Records</strong></p>
<p>Ancient proverb: If one is sick and does not seek treatment, one often recurs to traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>From &quot;Strategies of the Warring States&quot;: Zhang Chou said to Han Xiangguo: The reason why people appreciate Bian Que is that he treats swellings. If there were no swellings, no one would seek him out. Now, you, sir, are in favor of Pingyuan Jun, which is seen as adverse by Qin; yet it is your support for Pingyuan Jun that makes you adverse to Qin. I urge you to consider this carefully!</p>
<p>From &quot;Shizi&quot;: There was a physician named Qu, who was a good doctor in Qin. He treated King Xuan for carbuncles and cured King Hui of hemorrhoids, both successfully. When Zhang Zi&#39;s back was swollen, he instructed Qu to treat it, saying: &quot;This back is not my own, so let it be managed as it is.&quot; After treatment, it was cured. Indeed, Qu was skilled in treating illnesses, and Zhang Zi entrusted him with the management. The body of the nation is also like this; one must be entrusted with authority before treatment can begin.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Han Zi&quot;:</strong> A good physician can suck out a person&#39;s wound, drawing human blood. This is not out of kinship in flesh and bone, but because of its beneficial nature.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Zhuangzi - Heaven and Earth&quot;:</strong> In the medicine of the Yu clan, there are ailments that are bald and afflicted. When ill, one seeks a doctor. A filial son administers medicine to care for his kind father, his complexion burning with color; the sage is ashamed of this.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Geng Sang Chu&quot;:</strong> Nan Rong Zhu said: When someone in the village is ill, the villagers ask about it. The sick can describe their ailments, yet even so, they may not truly be sick. If Zhu understands the great way, it&#39;s like drinking poison to treat an illness. Zhu wishes only to understand the classics of health. Laozi said: In the classics of health, can one embrace unity? Can one avoid loss? Can one know fortune and misfortune without divination? Can one be still? Can one cease? Can one set aside others and seek oneself? Can one be carefree? Can one be untroubled? Can one be like a child? A child howls all day without restraint; this is the utmost harmony: to hold on all day without twitching fingers, sharing its virtue; to gaze all day without squinting eyes, not looking outward. Acting without knowing where to go, residing without knowing what to do, flowing with things and merging with their rhythm—this is the classic of health. Nan Rong Zhu said: So this is the virtue of the ultimate person? It was replied: No. This is what is known as ice melting and thawing. The ultimate person engages harmoniously with the earth and communes with the heavens, not clashing over gain or loss, not finding strangeness in each other, not conspiring with one another, not engaging in matters with one another, coming and going carefreely—that is called the classic of health.&quot;<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br>In the &quot;Essence of Mozi,&quot; Mozi said: &quot;It is only that which can be practiced; it is like medicine. The root of a plant, the Son of Heaven consumes it to alleviate his illness; how can one say it is just the root of a grass and not consume it? Now, when a farmer presents his taxes to a great lord, the lord offers wine and grains as offerings to the deities and spirits; how can one say it is only something done by common folk and not partake? Therefore, even though they are of low status, in comparison to the farmer above, and the medicine below, can it be said they are not as good as the root of a grass? Moreover, has the sovereign also heard the tale of Tang? In ancient times, Tang was to visit Yi Yin and had the son of the Peng family serve as his charioteer. Halfway there, the son asked, &#39;Where is the lord going?&#39; Tang said, &#39;I am going to see Yi Yin.&#39; The son of the Peng family said, &#39;Yi Yin is among the lowly in the world. If you wish to see him, you should rather summon and question him, as he has received rewards.&#39; Tang responded: &#39;This is not something you understand. Now, if there is a medicine here that enhances hearing and vision, I will surely advocate for it and force myself to consume it. As for Yi Yin in our state, he is like a good doctor or good medicine; if you do not wish for me to see Yi Yin, then you do not wish for my well-being.&#39; Thus, Tang sent the son of the Peng family away and did not allow him to serve.&quot;<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br>In the &quot;Zhou Mu Wang&quot; chapter of &quot;Liezi&quot;: The Qin people had a son named Shao, who was kind in his youth but became afflicted with a delusional disorder in his adulthood. He heard songs and thought they were wails; he looked at white and thought it was black; he savored fragrant food and thought it was rotten; he tasted sweetness and thought it was bitter; he mistook the wrong for the right. Wherever he directed his mind, the world was turned upside down—the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—nothing was not distorted.</p>
<p>Yang said to his father, &quot;The gentlemen of Lu are skilled in various arts; will they be able to help him? Why don&#39;t you seek their counsel?&quot; His father, traveling through Lu to Chen, encountered Laozi and mentioned his son&#39;s condition. Laozi said, &quot;Do you not know the extent of your son&#39;s delusion? People today are all confused about right and wrong, muddled by profit and loss; many share the same affliction, yet none are aware of it. Moreover, one person&#39;s delusion is not enough to undermine a whole family; a family&#39;s delusion is not enough to turn an entire village; a village’s delusion is insufficient to topple a nation; a nation&#39;s delusion cannot bring down the world. If the whole world were to be as deluded as your son, you would be the one deluded instead.</p>
<p>Who can correct the sounds of joy and sorrow, the colors and scents that define right and wrong? Additionally, my words may not necessarily be free from delusion; how can the gentlemen of Lu, who are themselves deluded, help to resolve the delusions of others? The grains of your honor are no better than a swift return home.&quot;<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>&quot;The Transmission of the Han Poems&quot; states: In times of peace, there are no mute, lame, blind, hunchbacked, or deformed individuals; fathers do not weep for their sons, and brothers do not weep for their siblings. The way does not maintain the burdens of past care, yet each meets their end in sequence; this is the skill of a wise physician, hence harmony and stability. The method of dispelling ailments lies in no other but in employing the wise. </p>
<p>The poem says: There are the blind, there are the blind, in the courtyard of Zhou. They are the remnants of Zhou&#39;s rule. The ruler&#39;s ailments number twelve; without a wise physician, no one can cure them. What are these twelve ailments? They are atrophy, stumbling, reversal, swelling, fullness, obstruction, blindness, agitation, breathlessness, paralysis, and turmoil. How does a wise physician treat them? By reducing burdens and lightening punishments, atrophy does not arise; by preventing the common people from suffering hunger and cold, stumbling does not occur; by preventing wealth from being hoarded, reversal does not happen; by ensuring granaries do not rot, swelling does not develop; by keeping treasury and storage full, fullness does not ensue; by not allowing ministers to indulge, obstruction does not manifest; by ensuring lower sentiments reach the upper echelons, blindness does not occur; by showing care for the lower classes, agitation does not transpire; by implementing laws diligently, breathlessness does not arise; by preventing resentment from below, turmoil does not manifest; by not allowing the wise to hide away, paralysis does not occur; and by preventing the people from singing and defaming, turmoil does not arise. </p>
<p>The high officials and ministers are the core members of the ruler&#39;s body. If these core members are free from ailments, then the ruler is also free from ailments. Thus, without a wise physician, no one can heal. If everyone suffers from these twelve ailments and does not employ the wise, then the nation is no longer its own. The poem says: Many will be deeply entrenched and beyond remedy; ultimately, they will perish. Therefore, if the wise physician is employed, the common people will be free from ailments; how much more so the ruler!<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>In &quot;The Chronicles of the Li Family,&quot; it is stated: In Lu there was a man named Gongsun Chao, who told people: &quot;I can treat deficiencies.

When in the presence of the ruler, the nobles and guests celebrated. The disciples and the gathered guests offered cures. One disciple remarked: &#39;The reason for presenting remedies is because of illness. Now that Liang Qiu has recovered, why do the scholars again offer remedies? Do they suspect that Liang Qiu will encounter another snake bite and therefore wish to apply them?&#39; Everyone sat in silence with no reply. What do you think of this disciple&#39;s statement?&quot; Confucius replied: &quot;Your assertion is incorrect. A good doctor often experiences three failures before succeeding. Given that Liang Qiu encountered a snake bite and recovered, he must think of those who share his ailment and will certainly inquire about the remedies. For this reason, everyone is discussing different remedies, wanting to sell their knowledge to those in need. Those who mention their remedies claim they are good as a way to compare the quality of their cures.&quot;</p>
<p>In the text from &quot;Xin Yu&quot;: In the past, Bian Que lived in Song, but fell into disfavor with the ruler, and fled to Wei. In Wei, there was a person gravely ill nearing death. When Bian Que arrived at their home to treat him, the patient&#39;s father said: &quot;My son is critically ill and will have a renowned doctor come to treat him; you cannot help him.&quot; He sent Bian Que away. Instead, he summoned a spirit medium to seek blessings and incantations, cursing Bian Que. The patient eventually died, and the spirit medium could not heal him. Bian Que was renowned as the best doctor in the world but could not compete with the spirit medium. Those who sought distant help overlooked what was near, hoarding vast resources while neglecting what was right in front of them; this is what it means!<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br>The &quot;Huainanzi&quot; on the main principles states: Among all things in the world, nothing is more toxic than chicken poison. However, a good doctor can extract and preserve it, finding use for it.</p>
<p>Miao Cheng states: Nothing is unused. The poison of heaven&#39;s might, black beak, and medicine; a good doctor uses them to save lives.</p>
<p>A skilled craftsman gradually perfects their work; within the realm of tools, there is nothing that does not conform. A sage king governs the people, a master craftsman governs horses, and a doctor governs illnesses—all use the same materials but seek their respective purposes.</p>
<p>When a patient is bedridden, a doctor uses needles and stones, while a shaman uses incantations and offerings; the goal of salvation remains the same.</p>
<p>If a doctor cannot manage the illness, and the patient refuses medicine, that is folly.</p>
<p>In the forest teachings: It is difficult for a good doctor to treat someone with the same ailment as a deceased person.</p>
<p>A child worries for a father’s illness; the healer is a doctor.</p>
<p>In human teachings: To worry only after trouble arises is like a sick person who, exhausted, seeks a skilled doctor. Even with the talent of Bian Que or Yu Fu, one still cannot be revived.</p>
<p>In the teachings of the Tai clan: The reason Bian Que is esteemed is not merely for adjusting medicine according to the illness but for feeling the pulse and blood, to understand the origins of the sickness.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian,&quot; the biography of the sun states: Jia Yi said, &quot;I have heard that the ancient sages, who did not reside in the court, would surely be found among the physicians and diviners.&quot;</p>
<p>In the &quot;Explanation of Names,&quot; it elaborates on appearances: &quot;Pulse diagnosis&quot; is akin to skilled deception. When a physician feels another&#39;s pulse, they understand the nature of the illness and make a corresponding diagnosis.</p>
<p>Explanation of diseases: &quot;Rash&quot; signifies diagnosis. If there is a knot in the energy, it can be diagnosed and discerned.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Book of Yue,&quot; it states: &quot;If one dies without seeking a physician, or a nation falls without strategizing, they are merely inviting disaster upon themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>In the &quot;Discourses on Salt and Iron,&quot; it is said: &quot;Bian Que cannot restore flesh and bones; neither can a minor official maintain a fallen state.&quot; </p>
<p>Bian Que cannot treat diseases that reject acupuncture and medication; wise and virtuous individuals cannot correct a ruler who ignores admonitions and criticisms. </p>
<p>What is valued in a good physician is their ability to discern information and expel evil energies, not merely their skill in inserting needles and piercing the skin. </p>
<p>Officials are not considered good based on making many judgments; physicians are not deemed skilled based on making many incisions. </p>
<p>Bian Que knows the origins of illnesses by feeling the pulse — when yang energy is strong, it depletes and harmonizes with yin; when cold energy is strong, it depletes and harmonizes with yang. Thus, the energies balance, and evil energies find no place to reside. </p>
<p>However, an inept physician does not grasp the principles of pulse intricacies and the divisions of blood and energy, recklessly stabbing without benefit to the illness, causing only harm to the skin. </p>
<p>Now, to reduce the excess and supplement the deficient, the rich become richer, and the poor become poorer. Strict laws and harsh punishments aim to curb violence and stop wickedness, yet wickedness persists. The implication is that it is not Bian Que&#39;s needles and stones that are in play; thus, the people fail to fulfill their roles.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br>In the &quot;Thoughts on the Worthy&quot; from the &quot;Essays of the Hidden Scholar&quot;: Those who share the same plight as the dead cannot thrive, and those who walk alongside a fallen nation cannot endure. Is this merely empty talk? How can we know a person is unwell? It is because they do not crave food. How can we know a nation is about to fall into chaos? It is because they do not value the worthy. Therefore, in the household of a sick person, it is not that there are no fine dishes, but the person is unable to eat them, which leads to death. In the government of a chaotic nation, there are not no virtuous people, but the ruler is unable to employ them, resulting in its downfall.</p>
<p>To live on fine rice and drink sweet wine is to nourish life. Yet a sick person loathes these, thinking them inferior to beans, wheat, and drinking clear broth; this is an omen of impending death. To respect the worthy and employ the capable, to trust the loyal and accept advice, is the foundation of security. Yet a blind ruler despises this, believing it is inferior to flattering sycophants; this is a sign of imminent destruction. Laozi said: &quot;Only the ailing are ill, thus they do not suffer.&quot; The Book of Changes states: &quot;Their loss, their loss, is tied to the mulberry.&quot; Therefore, those who cultivate longevity begin with treating illness through medicine; those who nurture a realm begin by restoring order through employing the worthy, thus they can keep themselves secure and their nations thriving.</p>
<p>The highest physician treats the nation; the next, the illness. Governing a nation is akin to caring for one’s own body; sickness pertains to the body, chaos pertains to the state. The body’s ailments await a physician for recovery; a nation’s chaos awaits the worthy for restoration.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br>To govern the body, there is the method of the Yellow Emperor; to govern the world, there are the teachings of Confucius. However, when illnesses go untreated and chaos remains unaddressed, it is not due to errors in the acupuncture or medicinal practices, nor are the words of the Five Classics misleading; rather, it is because those who apply them are unworthy. If unworthy, then measures are not circular, standards are not square, ropes are not straight, and plumb lines are not level. Drilling will not produce fire, striking stone will not yield gold, a golden horse cannot be chased for speed, and an earthen boat cannot cross water. All these eight are aspects of Heaven&#39;s way, observable in form; if one is unworthy, still achieving nothing, how much less can one expect to wield the Way of governance and steer the hearts of the people, riding the six dragons? Governing the world without true worthies is akin to treating illness without good physicians. In treating illness, one must have ginseng, but instead receives pigweed; one must have ophiopogon, but instead steams common wheat. If one fails to recognize the genuine and mixes remedies, the illness exacerbates without realizing one has been deceived. Consequently, one mistakenly believes the prescriptions are insincere and that medicines are useless for the illness, thus discarding later remedies and daring not to ingest them, instead only seeking shamans—even if facing death, this is acceptable. Rulers should seek worthy individuals and respond with humility and truth, not to promote their own agenda, and should not draw true worthies into base positions. When the country is in turmoil, they do not realize they are deceived by the inferior. One thus mistakenly claims the classics are untrustworthy and that virtue is of no benefit for rescue, abandoning the true words and no longer seeking improvement, instead relying on common officials—even facing ruin, this is acceptable. Below the Three Dynasties, all used pigweed with steamed common wheat in their prescriptions, leading to increasing illness and eventual death.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br><strong>Treatise on Forgiveness</strong>: In treating illness, one must first know the strengths and weaknesses of the pulse and where the Qi is blocked; only then can a prescription be made, thus allowing for recovery and prolonged life. In governing a nation, one must first understand the sufferings of the people and the origins of calamities; only then can prohibitions be set, allowing for the resolution of deceit and the peace of the country.</p>
<p><strong>Record of Narrations</strong>: Buying medicine and obtaining a wild goose is a difficult task for a doctor.</p>

<p>In &quot;Shen Jian&quot;: Medicine heals; it is used to treat illness. If there is no illness, there is no need for medicine. Just as meat cannot endure excessive food, how can it endure medicine? Cold leads to heat, and excessive heat can cause stagnation of yin. The use of medicine must be appropriate, otherwise it becomes harmful. If the vital energy is balanced, then there will surely be harm. The same applies to acupuncture and fire. Therefore, those who nurture their nature should not take too much medicine; it is only important to manage it in moderation.</p>
<p>In &quot;Wai Shi&quot;: A scholar who does not assist others while seeking power is like a sick person who does not rely on medicine while seeking recovery.</p>
<p>When Zhang Qiu conducted his duties, he inquired about the way to govern the people from a wise man. The wise man advised him, saying: &quot;Why not heal?&quot; Zhang Qiu asked: &quot;What do you mean?&quot; The wise man replied: &quot;When the world lacks proper governance, the emperor suffers from a false sense of grandeur, feudal lords become negligent, the common people face hunger, high officials fall prey to greed, and those in power engage in corruption. Those dismissed from office court favor from influential powers with harmful agendas. A state is like a home; when there are dangers both above and below, turmoil and attacks will arise, and the nation will be in peril. If you wish to govern the people, healing is all that is needed.&quot; Zhang Qiu asked: &quot;How do I heal?&quot; The wise man replied: &quot;You can use benevolence and righteousness as medicine, and governance and education as broth. First, heal the illnesses of the rulers, then address the ailments of the feudal lords and commoners. Would that not be virtuous?&quot; Zhang Qiu responded: &quot;This is the art of healing from the master; how can the disciple dare to do this?&quot; The wise man concluded: &quot;Fear not, for by healing the feudal lords, if they recover, the nation will not be in danger. If the feudal lords do not recover, it is not only a calamity for the borders but also a disaster for the country.&quot;<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>From this, we can see that the relations of scholars with feudal lords are akin to the relationships of physicians with their patients; they cannot be separated. Yet the Master asks, is it not out of desire for the Jin people that I release myself? One might ask: How can one consider the scholar&#39;s interaction with the lords? </p>
<p>In ancient times, there was a man from Zheng who suffered from a serious illness for three years without leaving his house. Someone advised him, saying: &quot;Your illness is grave; should you not seek a good doctor to cure you?&quot; He replied: &quot;The market has no good doctors; what can I seek?&quot; The advisor said: &quot;There is a good doctor in Chu; if you offer him a hundred pieces of gold, he will certainly travel a thousand miles to help you.&quot; The man from Zheng indeed obtained the good doctor from Chu and was cured.</p>
<p>Thus, the physician does not seek out illness to treat; rather, it is the ailing who seek out the physician. Therefore, for the scholar, it is likewise the feudal lords that seek him out; he does not seek the lords for his connections. My acceptance of the Jin king’s invitation is like the Chu physician receiving the gold from the man of Zheng. When the man of Zheng received the physician, he was cured; if the Jin king does not achieve a cure from me, am I not similar to that physician from Chu? It is both a matter of trust and distrust. Now, the party strife has again made things difficult at court, and the illness of the royal family seems more severe than that of Jin already!<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br>The king of Shu was delighted to see the ambassador, but upon hearing of his illness, he suddenly became distressed and went to his door with a single cart.

The king, upon seeing Li Yuan, inquired, &quot;Is the ambassador unable to come out?&quot; Li Yuan replied, &quot;He is unable.&quot; The king asked, &quot;May I enter to see him?&quot; Li Yuan answered, &quot;He has already fallen asleep, wait until he wakes, then you may ask to enter.&quot; The king then asked, &quot;Is it possible that the ambassador suffers from a pestilence?&quot; Li Yuan replied, &quot;Pestilence is not an illness.&quot; The king said, &quot;Then what is it?&quot; Li Yuan explained, &quot;It is known that heaven considers a subtle deficiency as illness, and the earth regards collapse and overflow as illness. The Son of Heaven sees hidden severity as illness, while kings and nobles perceive arrogance and extravagance as illness. Scholars consider poverty and difficulty as illness, and high officials regard cruel flattery as illness, while common people see hunger and cold as illness. Thus, the ambassador&#39;s illness is difficulty. The state does not promote the worthy, leaving scholars in distress, confined on the roads, with many chariots and official robes accompanied by packs of wolves, and the rich surrounded by dogs and swine. From this perspective, how can a scholar be free from illness? Indeed, illnesses arise from subtle deficiencies and collapses, thus heaven and earth employ sages as healers; illnesses from hidden severity and arrogance prompt the Son of Heaven and nobles to utilize worthy individuals as healers; illnesses of poverty and difficulty lead scholars to seek guidance through dreams; illnesses of cruel flattery urge high officials to seek wise rulers; and illnesses of hunger and cold cause common people to rely on diligent officials as healers. Hence, the ambassador&#39;s illness is one that medicine and stones cannot remedy, and ghosts and deities cannot torment; neither cold nor heat can invade it. It shows in his countenance yet remains unseen in his decay, resonates in his voice yet is not visible in his sorrow. He sings with the drum and lute yet does not express his joy, sighs by the riverbank yet does not reveal his worries—this constitutes the ambassador&#39;s illness.&quot;<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Central Argument&quot;:</strong> A person suffering from illness should not be made a doctor, and one who is impure should not be made to follow the rules, as they lack validity.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Thank You for the Medicine&quot; by Liu Xiaochuo of the Liang Dynasty:</strong> A very small matter can cause a delay in growth. Renowned doctors take medicine from the city. Even though shamans observe symptoms, and famous doctors administer acupuncture, treasures such as pine nuts and jade broths—that is to say, one might be embarrassed by the multitude of precious offerings.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Family Instructions of Yan&quot;:</strong> In the matter of medicine, achieving subtlety is exceedingly difficult. I do not encourage you all to set your lives on it. By understanding the properties of medicine, even a small blend can be used in emergencies at home; this is also a worthy accomplishment, as were Huangfu Mi and Yin Zhongkan.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Central Discussion&quot;:</strong> The ailment of the inner gate does not manifest as pain, itch, or distress of the body; feelings and wisdom may lead one to be unaware of the depth of the illness. However, when the period arrives, the vital energy is suddenly exhausted, thus illnesses of the inner gate can lead to sudden death, which is what Bian Que detested the most. This is because Lu Yi could not distinguish it, and those who encounter it cannot attack it.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Miscellaneous Records of the Court and Countryside&quot;:</strong> Each doctor claims that a tiger struck by a medicinal arrow will eat pure mud to detoxify; a wild boar struck will peck at the jiachi (a plant). If animals know how to administer detoxifying medicine, how much more so humans? Jiachi is the same as sand ginseng, as stated in the &quot;Erya&quot; which calls it zhìni.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Li Shi Kan Wu&quot;:</strong> A physician who can discern life and death from reading pulses, if not endowed by heaven, has achieved this through accumulated learning. Initially, there may be skill, but ultimately, effectiveness diminishes. Scholars argue that in the beginning, skill is linked to the ability to command life, while in the end, it is related to the limitations of numbers. I say: not so. In the beginning, when one often succeeds, they delight in accumulating wealth; their memory is sharp, and their diagnostic skills are keen. As time passes, however, the muscles tire, willpower wanes, and the effectiveness becomes rare. The distinction between beginning skill and lacking later becomes evident here. If it is merely about numbers and their ebb and flow, can we truly say it reveals understanding of principles?</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Han Yu Zaoshuo&quot;:</strong> A good physician does not concern himself with whether a person is thin or fat; he only observes whether their pulse indicates illness. A wise strategist does not regard the stability or danger of the world but observes the principles of order and chaos. The world consists of people. Stability and danger equate to fatness or thinness. The principles of order are the pulse. If the pulse is healthy, being thin is not harmful. If the pulse is ill but one is fat, they are doomed. Those who understand this perspective comprehend what it means to govern the world. During the decline of the Xia, Yin, and Zhou dynasties, the princes rose and waged war incessantly. For decades, the world did not collapse due to the continuity of order. When the Qin unified the world and did not allow any power to the princes, they amassed troops and set fire to them. The world collapsed in just two generations due to the lack of orderly principles. Therefore, even if the extremities are free of illness, they cannot be relied upon; it is solely about the pulse. Even if the world is at peace, it cannot be a source of pride; it is only about the principles of order. Concern for what can be relied upon and fear of what can be boasted of — this is what the good physician and wise strategist call heavenly support. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: &quot;Look at the foot and examine the auspicious signs.&quot; A good physician and wise strategist will do this.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>&quot;On the Waking Words of Pine and Willow&quot;: People consume the five flavors to nourish the five vital energies; when afflicted, one alters the flavor and the energy diminishes, thus remedies are employed to restore balance to the flavors. This is the way of humanity, where rulers and subjects, parents and children, nurture one another; mulberry and hemp, grains and millet support one another. When there are violent people born among them, infringing upon the weak and offending the noble, it is necessary to correct this through punishment. In severe cases where factions grow strong and rebel against authority, military action is required to subdue them, allowing for order among the people. If there is no affliction, then medicine should not be tried; if the violent cease, then punishment can be reduced and military force can be restrained. Indeed, sweet flavors and rich fats, when overconsumed, harm one’s vital energy; how much more so with medicine? And how much more with those who apply wrong methods?<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>&quot;What I Saw in the Eastern Valley&quot;:</strong> Nowadays, the cost of herbal medicine is several times more than before for the cheap and common varieties, and for the more precious and refined ones, it is also several times higher than before. Even when carrying gold through the market, one may search for it without success; who does not know how difficult it is to obtain genuine medicine? Anyone who sets up a shop to peddle fake medicine is foolish. And those who wish to cure their ailments by purchasing fake medicine are even more foolish. What then should we do? We should be more cautious about our food and clothing. In ancient times, people prioritized diet and healthcare: in spring they consumed more sour foods, in summer more bitter, in autumn more pungent, and in winter more salty, balancing with smooth and sweet flavors. They maintained moderation in their diet, walking thirty steps after meals, thereby avoiding the need for a pharmacy. Careful eating and dressing is essential. If someone were to suffer from a disease and insists on following the notion of not taking medicine from a doctor, the expensive herbal remedies would not harm them. Especially dutiful children and loving grandchildren who care for their parents at home—how could they bear to watch them suffer without providing help? If a family has resources, they can still find good remedies; but if one is poor, what can they do? The poor indeed find it hard to obtain quality remedies, and the rich, even if they find good ones, may not necessarily have good doctors. Reflecting on this, I look up to the heavens and wish: may all people in the world find peace and happiness!<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Record of Tranquility&quot;:</strong> To eliminate ailments, one must return to the root; when the foundation is solid, illness can be attacked, and medicine can be effective. To manage a family, one must correct oneself; when one’s self is upright, other families can be governed, and commands can be executed. Strengthening the root and uplifting oneself is not something that can be achieved overnight.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Miscellaneous Sayings of Aici&quot;:</strong> Aici served the King of Qi. One day, he appeared in court with a worried expression, and the king, puzzled, asked him about it. Aici replied: &quot;I am unfortunate; my young child is ill, and I wish to report this, thinking that the king has no one to assist with these matters. Although I am in court, my heart is truly concerned.&quot; The king said: &quot;Why not speak earlier? I have good medicine; if the child takes it, he will recover.&quot; He then instructed to provide it to Aici. Aici bowed in acceptance and returned, giving it to his son, who took it and died shortly after. On another day, Aici was deeply mournful, and the king asked the reason. He replied with sorrow: &quot;Your servant has lost a child!&quot; The king granted him gold to assist with the burial. Aici said: &quot;A deceased child is not deserving of royal gifts, yet I have something to request.&quot; The king asked: &quot;What do you seek?&quot; Aici replied: &quot;I only seek the method that was effective for my young child previously.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Expounding on Brocade and Dew&quot;:</strong> In medicine, there is a method of pressing and rubbing; the pressing involves using hands to knead the affected area, while rubbing involves rolling and massaging it. The character for &#39;press&#39; should be derived from &#39;hand,&#39; so its written form should represent pressing. In the &quot;Jade Compendium,&quot; there is no character for &#39;press&#39; under the hand section. In the &quot;Broad Rhyme,&quot; the character for &#39;press&#39; appears, but is derived from &#39;talent.&#39; The character for ‘case’ is derived from &#39;wood,&#39; noted as being related to &#39;table.&#39;<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>&quot;The Deathbed Instructions of the Luan City&quot;:</strong> Wang Yanruo, an eye doctor, served under Zhang Wending.

Master Po was indeed keen on writing in this manner.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Notes from the Old Study Hut&quot;:</strong> Chen Ya wrote: Chen Ya has just passed the examinations this year, and the whole town is celebrating with Li Yatuo. Li is Ya&#39;s uncle and a doctor. In the North, those who forecast fortunes are called巡官 (Xunguan). Xunguan was a title for county officials during the Tang and Five Dynasties, possibly named because of their practice of traveling to sell their skills. However, people in the North refer to all doctors as Yatuo, without understanding the term.</p>
<p>Shizang Yong, known for his medical expertise, once stated that contemporary people possess weak capabilities, thus relying on ancient prescriptions, many fail to cure diseases. It is not just humans; even medicinal stones and plants are weaker than ancient ones. Without doubling the dosage, effectiveness cannot be achieved, hence Shizang&#39;s preference for hot medicinals earned him slander. Other doctors spread rumors, claiming, &quot;Shizang uses three buckets of fire from the eaves.&quot; Some feared him, while only Zhang revered his words. Whenever he saw friends storing medicinal elixirs, he would consume them without regard to quantity, sometimes without informing the host. The host would be alarmed and hastily warn against excessive intake, while Zhang laughed dismissively, yet it did not cause harm. This was due to a discrepancy in disposition, others could not replicate it. Ultimately, in the late winter, while lying on a stone, he ingested elixirs, and overwhelmed by the cold, succumbed to a hidden toxicity and died.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>&quot;In the &#39;Bo Zhai Bian&#39;: A man from Shu, Shi Cang, made a name for himself in the capital with his medical skills. Another from Youyang, Chen Cheng, also became notable in medicine. However, Shi favored warming medicines while Chen preferred cooling ones. The good doctors of old would measure the strengths and weaknesses of a patient, observe the yin and yang of the illness, and then prescribe remedies, either to tonify or drain according to the condition. Yet these two hold their own biases, categorizing everything into hot and cold, and both gained renown in their time. Why? There is a saying: Shi Cang uses three dou of fire from the eaves, while Chen Cheng relies on a plate of ice in his chest. Those who take mineral medicines secretly use the power of the drugs to satisfy their desires, yet they often tend to avoid discussing it. When an illness suddenly arises, even if they wish to keep it hidden, they cannot. Wu Jingyuan from Wuxing took sulfur—few knew of it. Twenty years later, his son Tuo was made an official in Huating and died due to a back ailment, revealing the lingering toxicity that affected even his son. Should one not heed this?</p>
<p>In the &#39;Jihu Lu&#39;: Xu Yinji, a physician, often said: The disease and the medicine must match; only one substance should be used to attack it for a quicker recovery. Nowadays, people are not good at feeling the pulse, but rather gauge illnesses with their emotions, often using excessive remedies hoping for efficacy. This is like a hunter who does not know rabbits, spreading nets across fields in the hope of catching one; the method becomes superficial. If one medicine coincidentally encounters another flavor that counteracts it, it cannot exert its full potency. This is a proof of difficulty in healing.&quot;<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>From &quot;Yunlu Manchao&quot;</strong>: In medical texts, the human pulse is described as having three parts: the cun, guan, and chi. The area beneath the high bone at the back of the palm is the cun, below this is the guan, and below that is the chi. From the high bone down to the point where the cun pulse can be felt, that is the cun; thus above the point at which the chi pulse can be felt up to the tip of the middle finger, isn’t that the chi? The ancients used the body as a measure, hence they expressed it in terms of the pulse. However, modern doctors merely bend the middle finger, using the ends of two lines as the cun, or they measure length with the hand on the side. Although they are not far apart, when asked how to name the pulse as cun or chi, they cannot answer.</p>
<p><strong>From &quot;Bingta Wuyan&quot;</strong>: Yang Zhu had a friend, Ji Liang, who fell ill. His son consulted three doctors: the first was a doctor of the Jiao family, who said: &quot;The illness arises after birth; we should attack its gradual development.&quot; Ji Liang remarked: &quot;Many doctors say the same.&quot; The second was a doctor of the Yu family, who said: &quot;The illness arises before birth; it is extremely difficult to eradicate.&quot; Ji Liang commented: &quot;This is a good doctor.&quot; The third was a doctor of the Lu family, who said: &quot;The illness originates from constitution before it takes form, uniting life and death as one.&quot; Ji Liang said: &quot;This is a divine doctor.&quot; After their consultations, his ailment healed. Ji Liang summoned three doctors and his illness was cured. I spent three months with him, reaching an understanding of life and death, and my ailment healed naturally. If I were Ji Liang, I would still have external concerns.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br>&quot;Records of Fragmented Thoughts&quot;: Confucius was an expert in abscesses, and Zhao Qi was considered a physician of abscesses.

<p>&quot;View from the Cold Eaves&quot;: In the past, when Qin Huan died, his eldest son inherited his techniques, and his medical reputation rivaled that of Qin Huan. However, his younger brothers, unable to surpass him in skill, each sought to create new and extraordinary practices attributed to their father in hopes of outshining their brother. It was not that they did not love their brother; they believed that without distinguishing themselves from him, they could not be valued like their father. There was no resolution in the world for this. Later, the father from the eastern neighboring state found writings in Huan&#39;s pillow and presented them as evidence, and thus the eldest son&#39;s techniques began to spread throughout the world. The historian&#39;s son said: In any dispute, there must be evidence. If one does not have solid proof, can the case be heard? Therefore, in disputes about chickens, there are proofs of beans and grains; in disputes about cattle, there are proofs of release; in disputes about thieves, there are proofs of touching the bell. Otherwise, against the evidence of mouse teeth and sparrow beaks, who can win their argument? Is it merely to distinguish the medical techniques of Huan&#39;s three sons? Hence it is said: Simplicity does not heed. It is also said: Examine the truth of their offenses.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>&quot;Notes on Comparisons&quot;: There are things that are effective for our use yet cannot be without drawbacks. A person with bad teeth takes苦参 (bittersweet herb) and their teeth recover, but their waist becomes heavy and cannot lift. Are there not similar examples in the world? The blue snake is poisonous, but its tail has the antidote; Angelica revives the blood, yet it also breaks the blood; Ephedra induces sweating, yet the root can stop sweating; sour jujube awakens from sleep, yet its kernels lead one to long for sleep; the mole cricket treats issues of urination before the waist but causes constipation afterwards; all is one thing, yet the applications differ. The same applies to medicine.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br>Asafetida has an extremely foul smell, but when used in food, it can remove odors; the smell of rancid meat is strong, yet if placed among it, it can mask the foul odor, though the scent of raw meat is not usually appropriate. A gentleman who governs a country has the responsibility to promote what is beneficial and eliminate what is harmful; one must carefully consider the circumstances of人才 (talent) when employing or dismissing them, right? </p>
<p>In the &quot;Jianming Shu,&quot; it is said: In the world of medicine, when doctors see someone unable to eat or drink due to illness, they immediately say the spleen is not grinding. However, just note that waterfowl like ducks, geese, and chickens have no teeth in their mouths and cannot chew food; they need the spleen to grind it before they can digest. Thus, their spleens are all thick and hard. Humans, on the other hand, differ from other animals; they have teeth and can chew foods, so their spleens are soft and weak, primarily relying on the qi for transformation. When a patient has weak spleen and stomach qi, they cannot digest food, not because of lack of grinding. The &quot;Jia Yu&quot; states: for those that gnash and swallow, they have eight orifices and are born from eggs; for those that grind their teeth, they have nine orifices and are born from live birth. Eggs and live births are fundamentally different, and so are the spleens and stomachs. Yet, medical practitioners do not comprehend this principle and speak generally, despite many through history, none have gained insight into this matter.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Yu Xiao Ling Yin,&quot; it is recounted: In the past, Duke Wen&#39;s two servants entered into the vital organs, and Bian Que identified it; Empress Cui of the Qin entered the spiritual realm, and Xu Zhi Cang recognized it. This was not due to an examination of their ailments, but rather a diagnosis of their hearts.</p>
<p>In &quot;San Yu Zhuibi&quot;: It is said that old doctors are valued more than young diviners, as the former are esteemed for their experience while the latter are prized for their youth. Old doctors all understand this, yet when asked about the meaning, young diviners cannot explain it. According to Wang Yanfu&#39;s &quot;Chen Shi,&quot; age brings experience, while youth brings decisive action. Thus, we know that this saying has existed for a long time.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>&quot;Chang&#39;an Guest Talk&quot;: In the Taiyuan Medical Office, there is a bronze figure, hollow and filled with water, with all its key points open.

<p>&quot;Records of the Unusual&quot;: When a disease has reached a critical point, bitter medicine is ineffective, hence the use of acupuncture and moxibustion. Needles are effective for promoting circulation and alleviating stagnation, while moxibustion is for enhancing the flow of qi and blood. The ancients referred to it as the fire of longevity, also called the three contemplations of fire.</p>
<p>&quot;Snow Wave Novels&quot;: It is said that in a certain area, there was a person with a painful foot ulcer, unbearable in its agony, who told his family: &quot;Carve a hole for me in the wall.&quot; Once the hole was made, he extended his foot through it, reaching into the neighbor&#39;s house by a foot or so. The family asked: &quot;What does this mean?&quot; He replied: &quot;Let it be so, I will endure the pain in the neighbor&#39;s house; it has nothing to do with me.&quot; There was also a physician skilled in surgery. A soldier was shot by an arrow, the shaft penetrating deeply into the membrane; he brought it to the physician, who took the scissors from Bingzhou and knelt to request treatment. The soldier said: &quot;The arrowhead is embedded in the membrane and must be treated urgently.&quot; The physician replied: &quot;This is an internal matter; I did not expect to be held responsible.&quot; Alas! Though the foot goes into the neighbor&#39;s house, it is still my foot; though the arrow is within the membrane, it is still the physician&#39;s matter. Yet one desires to partition a foot through a wall and separate disciplines between membranes; how then can pain cease? How can accountability be evaded?<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br>Once there was a physician who claimed to be able to treat hunchbacks, saying: &quot;Like a bow, like a shrimp, like a curved ring, extend my treatment, and one can be cured in the morning and stand straighter by evening.&quot; A man believed him and sought treatment for his hunchback. The physician took two boards, placing one on the ground and having the hunchback lie on it, then placed the other board on top and pressed down. The hunchback straightened, but also died. The man&#39;s son wanted to report this to the authorities, but the physician said: &quot;I aim to straighten hunchbacks; I don’t concern myself with whether people live or die.&quot; Alas! In the world today, those in power only care about taxes and resources, indifferent to the lives of the common people. How is this different from that physician? However, if not for the presence of a wise ruler who exercises restraint and implements benevolent decrees, could one expect the officials to be any better than a hunchback&#39;s physician?</p>
<p>In the &quot;Qiu Xun&quot; chapter: When treating an illness with medicine, once the patient is well, they should stop taking medicine. If they continue, it will only accumulate and cause illness again.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Qiu Zhi&quot; compilation: Nothing is more significant in governance than the military and punishment, and nothing is more important for the people&#39;s livelihood than medicine. Thus, the Zhou officials had detailed provisions for inquiries, pardons, and forgiveness, avoiding arbitrary punishment; Tan Shi discussed military preparedness, ensuring no defeat in battle; oversight of successes and failures, eliminating the need for ineffective physicians. Now, in the Supreme Court&#39;s criminal department, with individual perspectives, those supervising military operations lack strategic foresight, and the people&#39;s health programs are neglected. How can one expect to promote governance that truly cares for the people?<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br><strong>Outer Compendium</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Private Thoughts on Herbalism&quot;</strong>: During the time of Shennong, common people sought medicinal beasts. When someone fell ill, they would caress the beast and convey words to it. The words were as transmitted by the common people, and their meaning was unknown. Once the words were spoken, the beast would immediately act like it was in the wild, picking a herb with its mouth, crushing it for juice, and taking it to recover. Later, the Yellow Emperor commanded Feng Hou to record which herbs arose for which diseases; after a long time, the formulas were fully verified. There is an ancient saying that the Yellow Emperor once tried all the herbs, which is not true. Therefore, Yu Qing said: the Yellow Emperor learned medicine from the beasts.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Questions of Tang&quot; in Liezi</strong>: Duke Hu of Lu and Qi Ying of Zhao both fell ill and sought treatment from Bian Que. After Bian Que treated them, they both recovered. He said to Duke Hu and Qi Ying: &quot;Your previous ailments were caused by external disturbances affecting your internal organs, due to the effects of herbs and stones. Now there is a coexisting ailment that ages with the rites; what would happen if we attacked it together?&quot; The two replied: &quot;We wish to first hear your findings.&quot; Bian Que told Duke Hu: &quot;Your will is strong, but your vitality is weak, which makes you full of plans but lacking in decisive actions; Qi Ying has a weak will but strong vitality, leading him to think little yet be harmed by fixation. If we exchanged your hearts, then both would attain balance in virtue.&quot; Bian Que then made the two drink poisoned wine, which caused them to be in a stupor for three days. He opened their chests and examined their hearts, switched them, and administered divine medicine. Once they awoke as before, the two departed for home. Duke Hu returned to Qi Ying&#39;s home and found his wife and children, who did not recognize him; Qi Ying likewise returned to Duke Hu&#39;s home where his wife and children also did not recognize him. The two households then had a dispute, seeking judgment from Bian Que. Bian Que discerned the cause of their confusion, and the dispute was resolved.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>In &quot;Records of Qi and Xie&quot;: Xu Qiufu from Qiantang was skilled in treating illnesses and lived east of the Hu Gou Bridge. One night, he heard pained moans from the air. Qiufu got up and went to the source of the sounds, asking, &quot;Are you a ghost? Why do you suffer so? Are you hungry and cold and in need of food and clothing? Do you need treatment for your illness?&quot; The ghost responded, &quot;I am from Dongyang, my surname is Si and my name is Sengping. I used to be a fun-loving official but died from severe腰 pain. Though I am a ghost in Hubei now, my suffering is as great as when I was alive. I came to inform you because you are a good doctor.&quot; Qiufu said, &quot;But since you are formless, how can I treat you?&quot; The ghost replied, &quot;Just bind some grass to form a human figure, apply acupuncture to my腰 at two points, and then cast it into the flowing water.&quot; Qiufu made a grass figure, applied needles at the two points on the腰, offered a thin sacrifice, and sent it into the river. When night fell, he dreamed of the ghost, who said, &quot;I have been relieved. I also accept the food offered; thank you for your kindness.&quot; Qiufu then became an official during the Song Yuanjia period.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br>In the &quot;Record of the Times&quot; (朝野佥载): During the Jiushi years, a man named Yang Yuanliang from Xiangchuan, over twenty years old, observed at Wenshan in Qianzhu and dreamt one day of the Celestial Lord who said: &quot;My hall is damaged; you will rebuild it for me and you are capable of healing all diseases.&quot; Upon awakening and understanding this, he tried healing, and there was no case he could not cure. In Ganyuan County, a local official had a swelling as large as a fist on his back; Yang used a knife to cut it, and after several days, it healed. Daily, he earned a thousand in money from healing. He completed the construction of the Celestial Lord’s hall, but gradually, the effectiveness dwindled.</p>
<p>In the year of Ruyi, Zhao Yuanjing from Luozhou fell ill and, after five days, recovered, saying he saw a monk with a wood over a foot long, who taught him: “For those with illness, if you support yourself with this wood, you will be healed.” Yuanjing managed to find a similar length of wood and tried healing with it, which worked remarkably well. His door was crowded with hundreds of people daily. Inspector Ma Zhiji, noticing the gathering crowd, pursued a ban against this practice at the left platform, as patients filled the platform doors. Upon hearing this, Empress Wu summoned him into the inner court; there, government officials with ailments were healed by leaning on it. He was allowed to treat the people, and after several months, he earned over seven hundred strings of cash. Later, as efficacy declined, the practice eventually ceased.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>&quot;Records of the Divine Inquiry&quot;: Chen Zhai, a shaman from Jinjiang, Quanzhou, excels in the techniques of exorcism and has successfully treated many illnesses. There was a traveler from Zhangzhou named Su Meng, whose son was afflicted with madness that no one could heal. So, he went to seek Chen&#39;s help. When Chen arrived, Su&#39;s son saw him and shouted curses while pointing at him. Zhai observed, &quot;This sickness has entered his heart.&quot; He set up an altar in the hall, warning everyone not to peek. At night, he took Su&#39;s son and split him in half, hanging the body on the east wall of the hall, with the heart suspended under the northern eaves. While Zhai performed his rituals in the hall, the heart was eaten by dogs. Zhai, unable to find it, became alarmed and, wielding a knife, turned around and left. The hosts were unaware and thought he was merely performing a ritual. After some time, he returned, holding the heart and entered the sick man&#39;s belly, his hair disheveled and shouting, causing the abdomen to come together. Su&#39;s son regained consciousness, repeatedly calling out &quot;Pú pú.&quot; The family could not understand. A few days later, while traveling several miles from home, a postal official holding government documents died by the roadside. Originally, there were relay stations along the southern postal route every twenty miles, where postal officials passed on messages with talismans, and they would call out warnings to approach the next station. Zhai took the postal official&#39;s heart and revived Su&#39;s son, who fully recovered.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>In the &quot;Records of Dongpo,&quot; Wang Fangyuanlong said: Qian Zifei had an effective remedy for severe wind disturbances and often administered it to others. One day, he dreamt that someone told him: &quot;Heaven has decreed this illness for a man, and if you go against Heaven by continuing to treat, you shall suffer this illness yourself, and no medicine will be able to save you.&quot; Zifei, frightened, decided not to administer the remedy. I believe that the ailments decreed by Heaven cannot be treated, and therefore the medicine should no longer be effective. If the medicine is effective, it suggests that Heaven cannot inflict illness. This is an example of the affliction fearing the medicine, using Heaven as a means to prohibit human action. The sickness of Duke Jin was caused by two young boys, and Li Ziyu’s red pills were also revealed in dreams, indicating that there was some external influence. Zifei, not recognizing this, was coerced by spirits. However, if it were me, I would think differently; if a patient could recover, I would willingly bear their suffering. My family has a method that can be applied to the skin, which can cleanse the foulness from within the abdomen. It was tried in Huangzhou, and the illness healed well; now I intend to regularly administer it to others.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>In the &quot;Recent Records of What Is Heard and Seen&quot;: Zhang Wendin was stationed in Shu. On the Double Ninth Festival, while attending the medicine market, he took shelter from a sudden morning rain beside Zhang Ziyang, an itinerant physician, at the Yujuguan. Soon, the skies cleared, and a white-clad old man stood among the trees. He turned to Ziyang and said, &quot;I have something for you to communicate to your master.&quot; Ziyang nodded in agreement. The old man then handed out two medicinal pills, as small as millet, for Ziyang to deliver to Wendin. Ziyang asked, &quot;Do you know Yin? What is your surname?&quot; The old man replied, &quot;My surname is Ge. I have served as a vice minister and have been stationed in Shu for two terms. I have seen him before.&quot; Ziyang noted, &quot;This is your only visit, then.&quot; The old man said, &quot;Tell your master that I will come again another day.&quot; Ziyang took the medicine and reported everything to Wendin. He took one grain of the mercury, combined it with one tael of the medicine, and soon it made a sound, like a distant bell, clear and extraordinary. Listening closely, a round light suddenly emerged from within, illuminating the entire room. Startled, he took it, and the mercury transformed into gold. Wendin then ingested the remaining pill, sending someone to inquire again, but he could not be found.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br><strong>&quot;Longchuan&#39;s Reminder&quot;:</strong> Zhang Andao, knowing about Chengdu, followed as a medical officer. On the Double Ninth Festival, he was invited to watch the medicinal market. At dawn, it began to rain as the market closed, so he entered the Jade Pavilion to take shelter. Upon reaching the palace, he saw a Daoist sitting at the steps. He approached and inquired about his well-being. The Daoist said: &quot;Zhang Duanming has already been in Shu for the second time.&quot; The physician replied: &quot;He has only just come to Shu.&quot; The Daoist responded: &quot;You do not know. The average person&#39;s vital energy is sixteen taels; as one ages, it diminishes, and Zhang Gong has lost over half.&quot; I have known him well for a long time, and now to see you is not coincidental. He took off his clothes, presenting two circles of the medicine, saying: &quot;One circle can replenish one tael of energy.&quot; The physician said: &quot;Although Zhang Gong is fond of the Dao, he is inherently cautious and may not believe it.&quot; The Daoist replied: &quot;The reason for the two circles is precisely for you.&quot; He took one circle and one tael of mercury, put them into a furnace, covered it with a cup, and burned it for a long time, with a sound like cracking wood. After lifting the cover and tossing in some resin, he felt something unusual; after three tosses, the medicine was complete. One should know this is not an ordinary medicine. The physician returned directly, reported to Gong, and tested it as advised: every time he tossed in the resin, flames leaped up, illuminating the small pavilion where they sat. By the third toss, the flames were golden, and when poured out, they appeared purple-gold. He then consumed one circle and sent the physician to explore Chengdu, hoping to encounter it again. Later, he saw it again in front of the Kongming Temple and obtained another circle of medicine, but consuming it brought no other change.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>&quot;In the &#39;Records of Divine Encounters&#39;: In Jiangnan, there was Zhang Yaoqing, the governor of Jizhou, who had a strong attendant named Tao Jun. Jun was naturally cautious and straightforward. He had once served in the military and suffered an injury from a falling stone, which left him with ailments in his waist and legs, so he always relied on a cane to walk. Zhang ordered him to guard a boat at the mouth of the Guangling River. One day, while taking shelter from the rain in a tavern at Baisha Market, many people gathered there. Two students approached and spoke to Jun, saying, &#39;This man has a good heart; he should seek treatment for his ailments.&#39; They then called Jun over, gave him two pills, and said, &#39;Take these, and you will recover.&#39; After they left, Jun took the pills back to the boat. After a while, he felt intense pain in his abdomen, but soon the pain stopped, and his ailments greatly improved. He managed the oars and ropes with newfound ease and strength. Baisha is eighty miles from the city, yet he made the round trip in a single day without feeling exhausted. Later, he inquired about the two students but could not find them again, leading people to suspect they were divine beings.&quot;<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>In Jiangnan, a government official named Shen Zhang Yi was suffering from a fever and was in distress, feeling extremely bewildered. He saw a divine figure, about several inches tall, standing before his pillow, holding three pills and saying, “Swallow these, and you will recover.” Yi took the pills and quickly swallowed two of them, while the third one fell to the ground with a sound. He then got up to look for it, but couldn’t find it. His family, startled, asked what had happened. He recounted his vision, and his illness was immediately cured. That same day, he went out into the streets with no suffering at all.</p>
<p>The &quot;Records of Cao Prefecture&quot; state: In the early years of the Jiajing era, a local person named Wu Shiyu Kai, who was only a few years old, was afflicted with a severe illness that caused him great torment, and he felt there was no hope for salvation. One night, he suddenly had a dream where a man in a yellow cap came to him, urging him to get up. The man then used a knife to make an incision in his side, removing his intestines and stomach, cleaning and washing them, and then putting them back, applying an ointment on the outside. When Kai woke up, he immediately felt an extraordinary coolness and relief in his chest and was so amazed that he told his father about the dream. His father, touching his abdomen, found that most of the mass had already subsided. Elated and pondering, he said, “Surely, a divine healer has shown you mercy.” The next morning, he took Kai to the shrine of the Three Sovereigns, honoring various famous physicians, and, upon seeing the statue of the Real Man Sun, he pointed and said, “This is the one who treated my illness in the dream.” His father then offered sacrifices and renewed the shrine, and Kai was free from his ailment. After passing the imperial examinations, whenever he went on official tours, he would always visit the shrine to pay his respects, looking after its beams and pillars, maintaining and adorning it for the rest of his life.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>In the &quot;Chronicles of Pingyang Prefecture&quot;: Yang Dong, courtesy name Shizi, was a man from Puzhou. He was intelligent and well-read, excelling particularly in medicine. The magistrate He Lingbao once summoned him to the bedchamber of a young woman whom he suspected was unwell, instructing him to examine her. After checking her pulse, Yang declared that she was a healthy young man without any ailments. This caused great surprise. After his death, he practiced medicine at the transport office in Hedong, and those who recognized his face would exclaim, &quot;Isn&#39;t this Yang Shizi from Puzhou?&quot; He then stopped being seen. One day, Zhai Bing from Shuiwen Village in Ruicheng visited Puzhou and went to the pharmacy to inquire about someone’s name. His son replied, &quot;That is my deceased father. Why do you ask?&quot; Bing said, &quot;I had a previous agreement to visit your father on the 9th of this month.&quot; At that moment, Guo Weiliang and others questioned him about it, and Bing replied, &quot;I am an old physician who treated patients in my village.&quot; The crowd was astonished, suspecting that he was a spirit.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>&quot;Liu Yunshan was a doctor during the Wanli period. At that time, his skills were not well-known, and he died thirty-seven years before his name began to be recognized. Chen Ziwun heard this and said: &#39;How strange! Can this be true?&#39; A guest replied: &#39;In Hangzhou, there was a wealthy family whose member was gravely ill and on the verge of death. His family had already gathered to mourn him when a doctor suddenly appeared, saying, &#39;I am Liu Yunshan.&#39; After examining him, the patient recovered. The doctor refused the gold offered in gratitude and said, &#39;We shall meet again in Piling City, in the alley of the Temple of the Minister.&#39; A month later, the wealthy family’s son sought out Liu Yunshan, but an elderly man in the alley said: &#39;You are mistaken! Liu Yunshan has been dead for thirty-seven years.&#39; However, during his lifetime, Yunshan believed in the gods and once dreamt that he was instructed by the god of this temple to collect money to expand the shrine, and he even had an image of himself created beside the deity, which still resembled him. The son of the wealthy family leapt forward, looked at the statue in shock, and left, weeping. From then on, people from our county would come to observe, worship, and pray, with daily crowds and apparent miracles occurring. Chen Ziwun heard this and said: &#39;How strange! Can this be true?&#39; Nevertheless, I believe that had Yunshan&#39;s skills been known during his lifetime, he would have fully realized his ambitions. Being burdened with his skills but not having the chance to showcase them, this is likely why Yunshan refused to be forgotten even in death. Though the story might seem bizarre or incredible, a gentleman should also empathize with his aspirations and give it some credence.&quot;<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>In Shu, Liu Wenji recounted to me that in the past there was a so-called &quot;Old Immortal&quot; among the bandits, a remarkable figure who could bring dead people back to life and reattach severed limbs and bones. The bandits revered him as if he were a deity. Initially, when he was captured, they intended to kill him. However, they did not execute him immediately but instead spared anyone who had any skill or craft. The immortal was called &quot;the sculptor&quot; because he managed to be exempted thanks to his ability to sculpt figures out of clay. </p>
<p>One day, the sculptor was cleaning a large cauldron, pouring water and dismantling a house for kindling. The water boiled, bubbling over several times, and with a stick, he stirred it into a paste. The bandits were astonished and spread the word. When the leader of the bandits heard about it, he thought he was a sorcerer and decided to kill him. The sculptor said, “Allow me one word before death. Does the king not wish to accomplish great things? Why then kill an unusual man?” The bandit leader, intrigued, asked him to explain. The sculptor replied, “I possess a strange art: I can bring people back to life. This paste is granted by the immortals; whether by knife or axe, or even a severe injury, I can restore the severely wounded to full health in an instant.” The bandit leader then struck a person to test it, and it was immediately verified. The bandit leader was cruel and regularly killed people, inflicting various tortures without count.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br>Hundreds were flogged, their flesh and blood torn apart, barely alive. Those who were still breathing were handed over to the sculptor, who applied a white paste to them. All of them revived and were able to walk immediately afterward. In the army, many rushed to seek them, and every day food and drink were generously offered, thus gradually filling their clothes and bags. </p>
<p>One of the captured bandits had a favored general, who was struck by a flying stone during an attack and had his chin severed, barely breathing. The sculptor said, &quot;It&#39;s easy.&quot; He then cut off a person&#39;s chin and pressed it against the general&#39;s, applying paste; within a day, he recovered and could eat and drink as if he had never been injured. </p>
<p>At that time, Sun Kewang was overseeing the bandits as military supervisor. One night, inebriated, he killed a favored concubine, and by morning marched twenty miles, waking up filled with regret. On the way, he encountered the sculptor and jokingly asked, &quot;Was the military supervisor drunk last night? Why does he not look well?&quot; Kewang explained the situation, and the sculptor replied, &quot;Does the supervisor still think of that person? I will turn back and search for her.&quot; Kewang said, &quot;Alas! When the camp broke, the body was gone; I imagine it has been devoured by dogs or pigs. Where could we look?&quot; The sculptor said, &quot;If the supervisor orders me to search, what would dogs or pigs dare to eat a noble person&#39;s body?&quot; Kewang responded, &quot;Find me a rat! Are you trying to escape? I will send an officer to escort you to search.&quot; The sculptor laughed and said, &quot;What place is there to search? What could we possibly find?&quot; Kewang grew angry and exclaimed, &quot;Are you mocking me?&quot; The sculptor pointed to a nearby bundle and said, &quot;No need to search; right here it is.&quot;<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br>Ke Wang said: &quot;What use are rotting bones? Why carry them?&quot; The sculptor laughed and said: &quot;What does the supervising officer say?&quot; Ke Wang dismounted and unfurled his mat, his starry eyes swirling, looking as melancholy as rain-laden pear blossoms, for the soul within the tent had already returned. Ke Wang rejoiced and cried out, startling the entire army, which was heard by the bandits. The bandit leader said: &quot;This is a divine being! We shall confer an honor upon him.&quot; Fearing that the masses would not understand, he ordered in the large camp by the Great Marsh that each soldier prepare a table for gathering at the vast plain the next day. At that time, the bandits numbered in the hundreds of thousands, and they prepared hundreds of thousands of tables, the highest one designated for worship of the divine being. </p>
<p>Then the sculptor was dressed in a deep robe, with a silk scarf on his head, and shoes with silk laces. The sculptor was six feet tall, broad forehead, wide face, with a beard, resembling the gods depicted in society. However, when commanded to ascend the platform, which was high and precarious, the sculptor hesitated and did not wish to climb. The bandit leader ordered the soldiers to each draw their bows with arrows aimed at him, saying: &quot;If you do not climb, we will shoot!&quot; The sculptor had no choice; when halfway up, trembling in fear, he felt like he was a target for a myriad of arrows, yet dared not stop, and forced himself to reach the top.</p>
<p>The bandit leader commanded the three armies to lower their bows and arrows, lining up to bow below, calling him &quot;Old Immortal&quot; three times. At that moment, the sound echoed through heaven and earth, and from then on, they no longer called him the sculptor, but all referred to him as &quot;Old Immortal.&quot; From this point, the Old Immortal also no longer lightly tried his craft.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>There was a certain bandit who, after a battle, was injured and had a broken leg. The only thing that remained intact was a small piece of skin. He sought treatment from an old immortal, who refused, saying it was not easy. The bandit cried out in sorrow, presenting gold and silk as offerings, but the old immortal waved them aside, saying: &quot;These are external possessions; I have no need for them. However, I cannot bear to see your injury. I have no son; can you take care of me?&quot; The bandit swore by heaven that he would serve him as a child for life. The old immortal calmly opened his pouch, took out a small saw, and sawing off about an inch from both ends of the injured leg, took a living person&#39;s leg bone, measured it, and connected the two, applying medicine. In just a few days, he was healed. From that point on, anyone in the bandit group who sought his medicine dared not offer extravagant gifts, and all vied to become his adopted son.</p>
<p>Among the bandits, there was a favored servant girl known as &quot;Old Foot,&quot; beautiful and intelligent, skilled in calligraphy and painting, though her feet were not very slender, so she was named. She was in charge of all communications and written orders among the bandits and was favored by the bandit leader. One day, the bandit leader saw her sitting alone, and &quot;Old Foot,&quot; not wanting him to think she was with someone else, approached to serve him. The bandit leader, unaware it was &quot;Old Foot,&quot; suspected others were watching and struck her with his dagger, hitting her at the waist, breaking her bones and cutting open her abdomen, killing her. When the bandit leader realized, he was filled with regret and sorrow and urgently summoned the old immortal. The old immortal said: &quot;She is already dead; there is nothing to be done.&quot; The bandit leader scolded: &quot;Old cunning one, wasn&#39;t she one of the guards? You too, shall die for not being able to save her!&quot; The old immortal hesitated and said: &quot;It will take time to solve this.&quot;<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>The traitor Xiang desperately wanted to preserve his life and set a deadline of three days. The old immortal requested a period of thirty-seven days. They combined wine with medicine and poured it into him. A sound like a clattering came from his throat when a dagger was used. The old immortal congratulated him, saying he could be saved and would recover in seven days. They then took water to moisten his intestines, filled his belly, stitched him up with a needle, applied medicine, reinforced him with wooden boards, and bound him with ropes. Indeed, after seven days, the old man walked as he normally would. When the traitor died, his followers scattered, fleeing from Shu to Dian. Those who had always respected the old immortal protected him and accompanied him to Dian. </p>
<p>When the Yongli reign began, many of the followers posed as false nobility. The old immortal boasted among the nobles, accumulating wealth, and set up a residence in the eastern corner of the city. He piled stones to form a mountain, dug a well to create a pond, planted flowers and trees around, and raised hundreds of red fish. When guests came, he would float white fish out of the water for amusement and, when drunk, would sing loudly and lie down, completely unconcerned. Until Yongli fled to Myanmar, the old immortal followed him. When they reached Tengyue, he often faced the sky, as if he had something to express. One day, he said to Wenji: &quot;I am old! What should I do?&quot; Wenji replied: &quot;Just wait for death, what do you care? But your unique skills, which you have never shared with others, will be lost. That is a pity.&quot; The old immortal said: &quot;I do not refuse. My master gave me warnings when he taught me.&quot;<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>Upon inquiring about the reason for his situation, he replied: I am a man of the Chen surname, from Dengzhou in Henan, born to a scholarly family. In my youth, I attended the local academy, but I was not fond of the classic texts. There was a statue of gods and Buddhas beside the school, which I often played with. The schoolmaster would occasionally reprimand me, and when I returned home, my parents would scold me for not studying, which I could not endure, so I decided to run away, feeling lost and with nowhere to go. I prayed to Guandi and received an oracle that said: &quot;In the future, you shall stand shoulder to shoulder with kings and lords.&quot; Looking at myself, a lost child of a fallen family, how could I stand shoulder to shoulder with kings and lords? Yet, the divinity did not deceive me; the only ones who stand shoulder to shoulder with kings and lords are the immortals. I had long heard that there are many hidden immortals in Zhongnan Mountain, so I wished to follow them. Enduring hunger and cold, I searched everywhere but could not find anyone to learn from. One day, I reached the back of the mountain and, from a distance, saw a cave in the sheer cliffs, with people entering and exiting. I pushed through the thorns, climbed the craggy rocks, and reached the cave, where I saw a Daoist sitting on a stone, serene and unlike ordinary people. I was fortunate to think: This must be my master! I thus knelt and begged for instruction. The Daoist did not look at me and waved his sleeve, returning to the cave. I did not dare to enter, so I bowed at the cave entrance instead. This happened for three days, when suddenly a young boy appeared, holding something and showing it to me, saying: ‘The master has sent you this to eat.’ It resembled a cake, was white, about two inches square, and tasted sweet like honey. After eating it, I was no longer hungry. I secretly rejoiced and became more convinced, continuing to worship and request guidance.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>On the seventh day, the Daoist suddenly came out and asked me, &quot;Fool! What do you wish to do?&quot; I replied that I sought to become an immortal. The Daoist laughed and said, &quot;Go! You are not one of us, why do you torment yourself?&quot; I thought to myself that I had no place to return to, and that I might as well die by throwing myself off a cliff, so I wept and pleaded. After a while, the Daoist said, &quot;I see you are sincere. Here is a book; I will give it to you along with a lifetime&#39;s worth of provisions. Do not take it lightly, for if you reveal it, you will be struck by lightning. Leave quickly, and do not linger, for you will only be prey to tigers and wolves.&quot; I received the book with surprise and joy, hurriedly descending the mountain. Upon examining it, I found it was a collection of forbidden methods, about thirty pages long. </p>
<p>In Yan&#39;an, news spread that a certain governor had a beloved daughter who, while playing on a swing, had injured her foot with bones protruding. No physician could heal her, so a reward was offered for anyone who could, consisting of two hundred gold coins and a mule. I went to answer the call, followed the methods in the book, and indeed she recovered. I then returned home with gold in my pouch riding the mule. My father was angry and suspected I had acquired too much wealth. At that time, bandits had already risen, and they assumed I must have engaged in unjust acts, seeking to report me to the authorities. My elder brother, who was a government scholar, plead my innocence, emerging from jail to question what had happened and subsequently produced the book. Upon learning that I had come out, my father rushed to my brother&#39;s house wielding a big stick. My brother repeatedly explained the situation but was not believed, and presented the book as evidence. My father grew even angrier and tore the book to pieces, throwing it into the fire. My brother managed to retrieve only four pages from the flames, and I hurriedly hid them and fled.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>What is currently used is merely a remnant of what once existed. Over the years, even the four pages have been lost. This is how it is recounted. Before long, I died from illness. Alas! Not even a remedy from the hands of the gods could save me. One is destined for nobility, while the other does not escape the hands of thieves; the only difference lies in what we utilize. Similarly, if an elderly immortal can embody the will of their forebears and not succumb to thieves, holding onto these skills to navigate the world, then figures like Lu and Bian and Hua Tuo would not have been so prominent. It is a pity that those who become engrossed in wealth and profit mistakenly assume the title of immortal, only to ultimately perish at the hands of thieves. Nevertheless, whether a person encounters an immortal or not depends solely on the depth of their fortune and virtue. The old immortal who receives their text yet fails to preserve their fortune is evident. I once saw in a record that a certain Hou Yuan, having met an old man who taught him military strategies, ultimately became a thief and brought about his own demise; the story bears strong resemblance to this situation. I often wonder why immortals do not find their rightful recipients. If they keep their teachings secret, why do they so often pass them to the wrong people, resulting in harm? How could an immortal bear such consequences? Furthermore, the path of Zhongnan is not necessarily that of true immortals. It is said that their ointment is made by refining the oil of young maidens’ bodies, filling the room with firelight, flames rising to the beams, and as the light fades, the ointment is formed. Is this truly a method for saving people? Traditional medicine involves the extensive use of insects and fish, leading to a delayed rise of ten years. Moreover, killing people to save others is not limited to one or two individuals, but potentially dozens or hundreds; such a so-called old immortal is merely a thief from beginning to end.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>&quot;Chronicles of Emperors&quot;:</strong> Fuxi observed the patterns in the sky and the laws on the earth, studied the markings of birds and beasts along with the suitability of the land, drew from the human body and objects around him. Thus, he created writing characters to replace the primitive practice of knotting ropes for communication, and devised the Eight Trigrams to convey the virtues of the divine and to categorize the emotions of all things. This led to the understanding of the six energies and six cavities, the five organs and five elements, the yin and yang of the four seasons, the rise and fall of water and fire, resulting in the manifestation of images. The principles of all illnesses could then be inferred, and he analyzed a hundred herbs to develop nine needles for the rescue of the ailing.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In &quot;The History of Roads&quot;: Fuxi observed the six qi, examined yin and yang, and applied them to his own body. Thus, the rise and fall of fire and water through the four seasons were given forms, and the principles behind various illnesses were categorized. He then attempted to create treatments using needles to address the ailments of the people, leading them to greater trust. [Note: In ancient times, needles were used, but later generations used a different method. The mountains of Gao have many such needles.]</p>
<p>Supplement from &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;: Shennong used a red whip to hit plants, beginning to taste all herbs and thus establishing medicine. From &quot;The Chronicles of Emperors&quot;: The Flame Emperor, Shennong, grew by the rivers, teaching the world to cultivate grains for food, saving lives and reducing killings. He tasted herbs to declare their medicinal properties, saving lives from misfortunes, which people used daily without knowing. He authored the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; in four volumes.</p>
<p>From &quot;Records of the Search for Spirits&quot;: Shennong wielded a red whip on countless herbs, comprehending their properties of being balanced, poisonous, cold, or warm, and their scents and flavors. He disseminated all grains and thus was honored as the Divine Farmer Emperor.</p>
<p>From &quot;External Records&quot;: In ancient times, when the people fell ill and were ignorant of remedies, the Flame Emperor began to taste herbs and plants, observed their cold, warm, and balanced properties, and discerned the roles of chief, minister, assistant, and guide. In one day, he encountered seventy poisons and transformed them miraculously. Consequently, he authored texts to treat the maladies of the people, marking the beginning of medicine. He further assessed the sweetness and bitterness of springs, guiding the people on what to avoid and seek. As a result, the populace lived in peace and had strong livelihoods, free from premature death, which was beneficial to all under heaven.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;History of the Road,&quot; Shennong asked the Little Boy of Taiyi: &quot;In ancient times, people lived beyond a hundred years, but later generations do not investigate the years determined by heaven, resulting in the blame of untimely death. What breath or essence accounts for this?&quot; The Little Boy replied: &quot;Heaven has nine gates, with the middle path being the best. Thus, he studied the Great Beginning, examined the jade book, ground the shellfish whip, analyzed colors and odors, and tasted herbs and plants to correct their names. He scrutinized their toxicity, marked their dryness and coldness, observed their fears and aversions, discerned their ministerial uses, clarified and corrected them to nourish life and treat illness. In one day, he dealt with seventy poisons, reaching to the essence of breath. There were four hundred diseases recorded, with three hundred sixty-five medicines noted in the &#39;Herbal Classics,&#39; exceeding which would lead to chaos. He commissioned loans for seasonal management of color and pulse, observed harmony and alignment, applied techniques to benefit the world, and people could maintain their lives.&quot; </p>
<p>[Note: Ren Shuyi mentions that in Taiyuan, there is a divine cauldron hill and a cauldron used by Shennong to test medicines. Additionally, within Chengyang Mountain, there is a place where Shennong whips medicinal herbs. Shennong is originally known for his connection to herbs, and there is a Ziyang Temple in the mountain where the emperor distinguished medicines.]</p>
<p>In the &quot;Comprehensive Records,&quot; in the Annals of the Three Sovereigns: At the time of the Flame Emperor Shennong, he experimented with a hundred herbs daily, experiencing life and death a hundred times. He obtained three hundred sixty items to correspond with the number of the celestial cycle, which later generations recorded as a book, calling it the &quot;Herbal Classics of Shennong.&quot; He also composed formulas to treat contemporary diseases.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Chronicles of Emperors&quot;: The Yellow Emperor, of the Xiong clan, commanded Lei Gong and Qi Bo to discuss the meridians, addressing eighty-one inquiries for the &quot;Classic of Difficulties.&quot; He taught the use of nine needles, compiling the &quot;Classics of Internal and External Techniques&quot; in eighteen volumes.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;History of the Roads&quot;: The Yellow Emperor, of the Bear clan, said: In the life of man, one carries the yin and embraces the yang, consumes flavors and is adorned with colors, swayed by cold and heat from outside, while joy and anger surge from within. Misfortunes and early death alternate between rulers and subjects. Hence, one should explore the extremes above and below, examine the five energies, establish the five movements, penetrate the essence of life, record the yin and yang, consulting deeply the teachings of Qi and Lei to create the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; Careful observation of the timing leads to inscribing it on jade tablets to be stored in the chamber of the spirit of orchids. </p>
<p>He explored grains in the granary and commanded Yu to examine the hall of clarity with Bai Bo to investigate the pulse, observing the timing diligently, ensuring comprehensive safety. He ordered Wu to prepare a prescription for medicinal elixirs, overseeing purification and treatment, allowing people to live to their full years. </p>
<p>(Note in &quot;Dao Ji Jing&quot;: Grains refer to the sage of grains, whose practice continues without rest for longevity. Wang Mang usurped the throne, planting five-colored crops in the palace, positioning them according to color, claiming this was the technique of the Yellow Emperor’s sage of grains. &quot;Ling Shu&quot; also discusses this. The &quot;Yellow Emperor&#39;s Original Genesis Canon&quot; mentions: The blood avoids the timing of yin and yang&#39;s vital energies, in the heavenly central positions, also known as the heavenly thieves, particularly avoiding needle moxibustion. &quot;Su Wen&quot;: By diligently observing the timing, the energies align, allowing combinations of color and pulse, leading to comprehensive safety. There are fifty-nine needling points below the stomach for fevers, detailed in &quot;Su Wen&quot;. The Yellow Emperor further inquired about treating ailments, where he commanded Qi Bo to taste a hundred herbs, overseeing medical practice; thus, the canon and herbal texts all originate from this. Therefore, &quot;Jia Yu&quot; states: The Yellow Emperor tasted the herbs and plants.)<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>&quot;Tongzhi&quot; Record of the Three Sovereigns:</strong> The Yellow Emperor of the Xuanyuan clan observed the five movements and six energies, and thus composed the questions to Qibo, which is known as the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; Some say that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; was written by later generations, but is based on the Yellow Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;:</strong> In the twenty-first year of Duke Xiang&#39;s reign, during summer, the ruler of Chu sent Fenzi to be the chief administrator, consulting with Shen Shuyu. Shuyu said: &quot;If a nation is filled with favor and the king is weak, then the nation cannot be sustained.&quot; Thus, he excused himself due to illness. As the summer heat intensified, ice appeared beneath the bed. Wearing dense silk robes, he ate little and slept. The ruler of Chu sent a doctor to examine him, who reported: &quot;He is extremely emaciated, but his blood and qi have not stirred.&quot; He then appointed Zi Nan as the chief administrator.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Guo Yu&quot;:</strong> At the meeting of Wen, the Jin people captured Duke Cheng and returned him to Zhou, where he was poisoned by a doctor. Since he did not die, the doctor was not executed. [Note: Duke Cheng relied on Chu and did not serve Jin, and he also killed his younger brother, Shuwu. His minister, Yuan Zhi, reported this to Jin, leading to Wen Gong capturing him. The poison bird is toxic; drinking its venom leads to instant death. It would be better to pay the doctor to dilute the poison, allowing him to survive. The doctor is not punished, for it conceals private malice in administering poison.]<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Muwang&quot; chapter of Liezi, it is said that a man named Huazi from Song suffered from a chronic illness causing him to forget. He would forget in the morning what he learned in the evening, forget what he had in the evening by morning, forget how to walk on the road, and forget how to sit in his house. Now, he did not recognize the past, nor did he recognize the present. His entire household was distressed by this. He consulted historians and tried divination, but it yielded no answers; he sought the help of shamans and prayed, but was met with no respite; he approached doctors and sought treatments, but it was futile.</p>
<p>In Lu, there was a Confucian scholar who claimed he could cure him. Huazi&#39;s wife and children asked him to use half of their estate in exchange for a remedy. The scholar said: &quot;This is not something that can be determined by divination, nor through prayer, nor by medicine. I will try to transform his heart and change his thoughts, hoping for a cure.&quot; Thus, he experimented by exposing Huazi to light when he sought clothes, providing food when he was hungry, and seeking brightness when he was in darkness.</p>
<p>The scholar joyfully told Huazi&#39;s children, &quot;The illness can be cured.&quot; However, I will not inform anyone of my secret method; let us keep it private for seven days. Following this, no one knew what he did. After many years of illness, on one morning, it all vanished. Once Huazi regained his senses, he became extremely angry, dismissed his wife, punished his children, and chased away the scholar. The people of Song caught him and questioned him. Huazi said: &quot;I used to forget, obliviously unaware of the existence or non-existence of heaven and earth. Now I have suddenly grasped the past and can remember losses and gains from decades, the sorrows and joys, all the tangled emotions arise within me. I fear that in the future there will be turmoil from losses and gains, sorrows and joys—my heart is like this. Can the momentary forgetfulness be regained?&quot;</p>
<p>Zi Gong heard this and was amazed, reporting it to Confucius. Confucius said, &quot;This is beyond your understanding, isn&#39;t it?&quot; He then instructed Yan Hui to remember it.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Strategies of the Warring States&quot;: When Jing Ke arrived at Qin, he presented a map of the region of Duhang. As the map was unfolded, his dagger appeared. He then grasped the sleeve of the Qin king with his left hand and held the dagger with his right hand, preparing to strike. Before he could approach, the Qin king was startled and stood up, causing the sleeve to tear; he drew his sword, which was too long for him to wield properly in his chamber. In his panic, the sword was stuck and couldn&#39;t be drawn easily. Jing Ke pursued the Qin king, who ran around a column. The ministers were astonished, caught off guard, and completely lost their composure. According to Qin law, the ministers who attended the throne were not permitted to carry weapons; those in the inner court held weapons, but they were positioned below the throne and could not act without a decree. In that urgent moment, there was no time to summon soldiers, which allowed Jing Ke to pursue the Qin king without being attacked effectively; instead, they attempted to grab him with their hands. At that time, the physician Xia Wuqie used his medicine pouch to assist Jing Ke. The Qin king was running around the column in a state of panic and didn’t know what to do. Those around him shouted: &quot;The king is unarmed! The king is unarmed!&quot; He then drew his sword and struck Jing Ke, injuring his left thigh. Jing Ke was incapacitated and tried to use his dagger to strike the Qin king, but missed and hit the column instead. The Qin king retaliated, inflicting eight wounds upon Jing Ke. Realizing that his plan had failed, Jing Ke leaned against the column, laughed, and scornfully said: &quot;The reason this mission did not succeed is that I aimed to force a situation and had to agree to a contract in order to reward the crown prince.&quot; As those around him advanced, they executed Jing Ke. The Qin king, feeling dizzy for a long time, eventually awarded titles and rewards to the ministers and those present, with each receiving varying honors, and granted Xia Wuqie two hundred taels of gold, saying: &quot;Wuqie loves me, for he used his medicine pouch to assist Jing Ke.&quot;<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

When he was faced with a calamity, he was struck by a stray arrow and fell ill while traveling. His illness was severe, and Empress Lu welcomed a skilled physician. When the physician entered to see him, Gao asked about his condition. The physician replied, &quot;The illness can be treated.&quot; Emperor Gao then scornfully berated him, saying, &quot;I, a commoner, took up a three-foot sword to seize the realm; is this not Heaven&#39;s decree? Life and death are in the hands of Heaven; what good is even Bian Que?&quot; He refused to allow treatment and dismissed the physician, bestowing him with fifty pounds of gold.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

The servant secured the medicine and hurried back, but as he approached the neighborhood, his horse stumbled and fell. The servant, fearing the master’s wrath and unable to return for more, went to a dye shop and begged for a bottle from the dye vat, deceiving the owner. After consuming it, Lingzi&#39;s illness was immediately cured. Tian only knew that he was healed and did not understand where the remedy had come from, thus he compensated the herbalist handsomely, and the reputation of the herbal medicine family rose.

After moving from Binning to Fengtian, Zhao Yi, and the North Gate, all these actions were to slow down Tao’s plans for the prime minister position. Yan attempted to forge a bond with Tao by acquiring a rare beauty at the North Gate, someone not easily found in the mortal world. Decorated in fine clothing, she was sent to be presented to Tao. Upon seeing her, Tao’s heart was stirred and he told his son, &quot;Such a beauty will definitely bring harm.&quot; Yan was not favored by the Taiyuan family; now with this bait, they aim to benefit the clan. After just one meeting, she was sent away. A special envoy was afraid to return, waiting for Yan&#39;s instructions.

<p><strong>&quot;Supplement to National History&quot;</strong>: Bai Cen once met an unusual person who shared a formula with him, which proved to be fully effective. Cen showcased it for profit but later became a minor general in Huainan. The governor Gao Shi forcibly took his formula, but it did not work very well. Cen eventually went to Jiujiang, where he was eaten by a tiger. The courier found the true prescription in his bag and delivered it, writing it down for dissemination.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Records of Wild Travels&quot;</strong>: During the Five Dynasties, Zhu Jin served Yang Xingmi and once suffered from a sore. The doctor was fearful upon examining him.

At that time, many people were afflicted by malaria, taking soil from Jin&#39;s grave and mixing it with water to drink, which would instantly cure them. He knew he would not die from illness in life, yet after death, the soil from his grave could still heal others; indeed, he was a remarkable person.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From &quot;History of Liao,&quot; Biography of Yelü Shucheng: Initially, the Khitan doctors were not well-versed in pulse diagnosis and medicinal prescriptions. The emperor ordered Shucheng to translate books on pulse diagnosis for wide circulation. From this point on, everyone became proficient, and even various clans understood medical practices.</p>
<p>From &quot;History of Song,&quot; Biography of the Second Daughter of Emperor Xiaozong: The Princess of Changjia was granted the title of Shuo Ren in the twenty-fourth year of Shaoxing and promoted to the title of Yongjia District Princess. She passed away in the thirty-second year. The edict designated the medical officials, such as Li Shike and others, to her attendants. During Xiaozong&#39;s time in the Eastern Palace, he reported that his young daughter was frequently ill and that the physicians should not be blamed, thus the matter was put to rest.</p>
<p>From &quot;Records of Talks by the Yan in Mianshui&quot;: During the reign of Xiangfu, some princes, due to illness, sought treatment from doctors with success and requested exemptions from far-off districts. Emperor Zhenzong remarked that having a physician attend to a district was not a matter of good governance but could be rewarded generously. He also instructed the chancellor to convey this intention.</p>
<p>From &quot;Talks Garden&quot;: There is a saying in the capital: &quot;When a death is pronounced by the physician, the edict for burial can ruin a family.&quot; This stems from the sent physicians who say, &quot;I have come under imperial decree; the prescription must be submitted with adjustments in order,&quot; often forcing patients to take medication until death ensues. For families under such edicts, they are required to wash their hands and wear specific cloths; three pieces each in white for individuals, with other items being customary. During the Yuanyou period, Duke Han Kang suffered from an illness, and upon the physician&#39;s observation, he was given a golden liquid pill. Although he could eat and drink for a while, the old duke&#39;s vital energy was diminished, unable to withstand external factors, leading to his death. The court dispatched envoys to inquire about subsequent matters, and due to confusion, an edict for burial was mistakenly promised, which later led to his sons and nephews distancing themselves from it.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a></p></div>

Because of his condition, they administered toxic medicines, causing severe leakage, which endangered his life. Yuqing saw through their scheming, had someone support him to sit and handle affairs, then summoned the malicious physician and killed him with a staff. After that, he went back to sleep and died before he could settle on the mat. He was buried on Hengshan. Even to this day, people fear him, and those who pass by his grave must lower themselves. Those suffering from fever would take soil from his grave and place it on their beds, and it would relieve their symptoms, demonstrating the high regard and fear in which he is held.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;Records of Escaping Summer&quot;: Su Zizhan delighted in discussing immortals, and later came to admire Yao Danyuan, whom he thought to be a reincarnation of Li Taibai, dedicating dozens of poems to him. Yao was originally the son of the wealthy Wang family in the capital, but was disdained for his lack of virtue and was driven away by his father to serve a Daoist priest at the Jianlong Temple. He was naturally intelligent and read extensively from the Daoist canon, being able to recite it all. He also acquired many formulas and elixirs, largely speaking grandly and crafting poems filled with wild and unconventional phrases, enabling him to gain recognition. He floated through Huainan, often changing his name; at first, Zizhan was unable to distinguish him. Later, he reverted to his surname and named himself Wang Shi. During the Chongning period, when I was in the capital, he had already risen to the position of medical officer through his skills. He frequented the household of Duke Cai Lu, often engaging in strange medical practices. I still recall that he spoke with Duke Lu about Zizhan&#39;s matters, claiming that he could describe the palaces of the immortals on the sea, making them visible in the sky. Duke Cai also trusted him. When arranging matters in Chuzhou, Liang Shicheng sought Zizhan&#39;s letters and recommended his skills. At the end of the Xuān Hé period, he again became a Daoist priest, named Yuancheng. He vehemently attacked Lin Lingsu, who poisoned him, causing him to vomit blood and die.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a></p></div>

Unable to repay him, I merely wrote a few pieces in running script. I also told him, &quot;This is the story of Anchang; it must not be neglected.&quot; When Shen Liaozu fell ill, he sought the Daoist for treatment, but feeling he had no money and being poor at writing, he urgently asked me for help.

Duan said, &quot;This illness can be cured with just a few doses of decoction, but it requires no less than five hundred or a thousand as compensation.&quot; The family initially agreed to half of that, but Duan brushed off his coat and left. Eventually, they complied, offering fifty strings as the fee for medicine. Duan then sought more, and the offer increased to a hundred strings before he was willing to dispense the medicine. As he had said, it worked, and he returned home with his earnings. On the way back, he had a dream of a figure in red garments who said, &quot;The Supreme Deity has chosen you as a physician, yet you take bribes, showing no heart for helping others.&quot; He commanded that he be beaten on the back twenty times, and his attendants obeyed.

Zhi Yuan replied: &#39;In the past, the physician He of Qin diagnosed the pulse of the Duke of Jin and knew that his good minister would die. If the fate of a good minister could be discerned through the pulse of the Duke of Jin, then why would it be surprising to know about a son through the father?&#39; The letter was roughly as such.&quot; Xu added: &quot;This is not Wang Jinggong&#39;s writing; rather, it is merely his disciple exploiting the master&#39;s renown to boast and promote his own practice.&quot;<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

When the people from the capital arrived, it was said: Jing had indeed used purging poisons to treat his foot ailment, leading to great misfortune. The court learned of this and ordered the palace where Jing had returned to be searched, sparing him from punishment and exiling him to Yongxing.</p>
<p>I then remembered when I was in the capital, that Fu, the author, and Yao, the official, both took Jing’s medicine and witnessed his demise.

The consort was puzzled and inquired about it from the attendants, learning the reason. She proceeded to explain with broad examples, which somewhat corresponded with earlier discussions.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Due to secret discussions among outsiders regarding Ji Xian, claiming he had benefited from unorthodox methods, I feared that slander would arise, and I could not bear to listen. The Emperor began to change color and nodded in acknowledgment. He dismissed the court and ordered a proclamation stating: &quot;I, with great benevolence, have granted you favor; thus, you have benefited. Such words as these will not allow you to see me again. Within three days, you shall have provisions for your own planning!&quot; On the day of Xin Hai, he commanded Ji Xian to reside in Fuzhou, with his descendants&#39; properties in the capital confiscated by the state; the strong servants and those sold off were allowed to be traded freely. After this order, there was great joy both inside and outside the court. Ji Xian had hidden many possessions and moved them far away, so even with confiscation, his wealth was not harmed. To this day, his former residence, adorned with magnificent beams and intricately carved eaves, is still called a grand estate. As his descendants spread apart, they could no longer sustain themselves. Some said his downfall came because he did not adhere to the proper way and thus was justly met with ruin. Zhao Xingzhi&#39;s &quot;Records of the Restoration&quot; meticulously details the beginnings and ends of Ji Xian, incorporating what he had heard about these events.</p>
<p>In &quot;Miscellaneous Records of Gui Xin&quot;: There were two physicians by the name Wang: Wang Jixian, the national physician during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, who later, for offering ineffective medicines at the De Shou Palace, was assigned to Fuzhou. Wang Jing was also of the same time as Ji Xian, serving in succession; later, while treating De Shou&#39;s illness, he prescribed cooling medicines but faced difficulties, ultimately returning home.

From Liu Shou-zhen of Hejian, he often used cool medicines. A prodigy who had added years to his life at a young age was summoned by Hui, who wrote the four characters &quot;medicine is not trifling.&quot; The prodigy mistyped a character, changing it to &quot;相&quot; (xiāng). Hui felt quite ashamed, and people said he had hit upon his illness.</p>
<p>In &quot;Records from the Wild,&quot; it is said: Duke Wei of Xu suffered from severe boils and the emperor visited him several times. A large gathering of doctors treated him for a long time but his condition showed little improvement. The emperor suddenly granted him a meal, and the duke wept as he ate it, secretly instructing the physicians to flee. Not long after, he passed away, and the news was quickly reported to the emperor. The emperor, in disarray, mourned and rushed to the duke&#39;s residence, commanding the execution of the physicians. The duke’s wife wept greatly, and upon coming out to pay her respects to the emperor, he comforted her, saying: &quot;Sister, do not worry for the future; I will take care of it.&quot; He then made arrangements for the aftermath and departed.</p>
<p>In &quot;Records of the Golden Terrace&quot;: Dai Yuanli of Jinhua was a renowned doctor at the beginning of the Jin dynasty. He was often summoned to Nanjing, where he visited a family of physicians. They welcomed him at their door and were quite busy responding to inquiries. Yuanli felt that their understanding must be profound, so he observed them closely. The prescriptions and medicines they prepared were all ordinary; he found this puzzling and visited them repeatedly. One day, someone sought medicine, and after leaving, Yuanli chased after him and advised: &quot;When preparing, add a piece of tin.&quot; The man waved him off. Yuanli was greatly surprised. Reflecting that no one adds tin when preparing medicine, he asked and was told: &quot;This is an ancient recipe.&quot; Yuanli found the source of this knowledge and it turned out to be just the character for syrup. He urgently corrected it. Alas! How can physicians, who cannot distinguish between syrup and tin, not be cautious in their practice?<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a></p></div>

One person made a grand affair of it, preparing drums, flutes, and banners, making a great din on the way. Someone mocked this in a poem saying: &quot;Shaking off authority, I leave Fengcheng, surrounded by drums and flags, the vibrant banners shining. Entering the forest like a fierce tiger, I catch a toad and poke out its eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>In the common folk, there were women skilled in medicine and pulse diagnosis, chosen from various departments to serve under the Imperial Medical Bureau. Those selected were honored with royal appointments, and many women took pride in this, calling them &quot;medicinal mothers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the Dust&quot;: A famous doctor was about to enter Shu when he saw a man carrying firewood, sweating profusely while bathing in the river. The doctor said: &quot;This man will surely die,&quot; but hurried to save him. The man went into an inn, took garlic, minced it finely, poured hot water over it, ate it, and sweated profusely like rain. The doctor remarked: &quot;Even the poor know of medicine; what about the rich and noble?&quot; Thus, he did not enter Shu.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Fei Xue Record&quot;: It is not advisable to consume wood frogs. A man from the Su family had two sons, both deeply loved, indulging them in their eating. They developed a chronic affliction. The father received a prescription that involved cooking wood frogs with pork. The younger son died that night, and the elder died the next day. The fool was careless, easily believing in false remedies, leading to the deaths of his two sons; how tragic! A friend, Ma Junwen, truly obtained a collection of medical prescriptions, which also included this prescription, thus noting this incident as a caution on the left.

One day, Li got drunk and drowned in the river. His family was unaware, but he did not return home for several days, prompting them to send trusted friends to search for him, but there was no trace. When the officials investigated, some reported his family, who hurriedly went to the site and found his body in a state of decay, only able to identify it with great difficulty. They wished to wash it but it was too late. Thus, they buried him in a place with piles of grass and erected a wooden sign at the grave that said: &quot;The Grave of Doctor Li, the Merchant of Medicine.&quot; Someone later wrote on the back of the sign: &quot;Li, the Merchant of Medicine, robust and discerning in trade. One day, heaven granted him a report, and he drowned in the Eastern Canal.&quot; Soon after, the family&#39;s finances deteriorated.

Someone asked her, &quot;Your husband was not negligent in his work; surely heaven should favor him. Why such harsh retribution?&quot; On another day, her later husband got her drunk and questioned her. She replied, &quot;The two servant girls I sent away were entrusted to the care of my late husband, one named Sandalwood and the other named Clove, but in truth, neither medicine was used.

<p>Ancient proverb: If one is sick and does not seek treatment, one often recurs to traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>From &quot;Strategies of the Warring States&quot;: Zhang Chou said to Han Xiangguo: The reason why people appreciate Bian Que is that he treats swellings. If there were no swellings, no one would seek him out. Now, you, sir, are in favor of Pingyuan Jun, which is seen as adverse by Qin; yet it is your support for Pingyuan Jun that makes you adverse to Qin. I urge you to consider this carefully!</p>
<p>From &quot;Shizi&quot;: There was a physician named Qu, who was a good doctor in Qin. He treated King Xuan for carbuncles and cured King Hui of hemorrhoids, both successfully. When Zhang Zi&#39;s back was swollen, he instructed Qu to treat it, saying: &quot;This back is not my own, so let it be managed as it is.&quot; After treatment, it was cured.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>&quot;Han Zi&quot;:</strong> A good physician can suck out a person&#39;s wound, drawing human blood. This is not out of kinship in flesh and bone, but because of its beneficial nature.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Zhuangzi - Heaven and Earth&quot;:</strong> In the medicine of the Yu clan, there are ailments that are bald and afflicted. When ill, one seeks a doctor. A filial son administers medicine to care for his kind father, his complexion burning with color; the sage is ashamed of this.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Geng Sang Chu&quot;:</strong> Nan Rong Zhu said: When someone in the village is ill, the villagers ask about it. The sick can describe their ailments, yet even so, they may not truly be sick. If Zhu understands the great way, it&#39;s like drinking poison to treat an illness. Zhu wishes only to understand the classics of health. Laozi said: In the classics of health, can one embrace unity? Can one avoid loss? Can one know fortune and misfortune without divination? Can one be still? Can one cease? Can one set aside others and seek oneself? Can one be carefree? Can one be untroubled? Can one be like a child? A child howls all day without restraint; this is the utmost harmony: to hold on all day without twitching fingers, sharing its virtue; to gaze all day without squinting eyes, not looking outward. Acting without knowing where to go, residing without knowing what to do, flowing with things and merging with their rhythm—this is the classic of health. Nan Rong Zhu said: So this is the virtue of the ultimate person? It was replied: No. This is what is known as ice melting and thawing. The ultimate person engages harmoniously with the earth and communes with the heavens, not clashing over gain or loss, not finding strangeness in each other, not conspiring with one another, not engaging in matters with one another, coming and going carefreely—that is called the classic of health.&quot;<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

Now, when a farmer presents his taxes to a great lord, the lord offers wine and grains as offerings to the deities and spirits; how can one say it is only something done by common folk and not partake? Therefore, even though they are of low status, in comparison to the farmer above, and the medicine below, can it be said they are not as good as the root of a grass? Moreover, has the sovereign also heard the tale of Tang? In ancient times, Tang was to visit Yi Yin and had the son of the Peng family serve as his charioteer.

Wherever he directed his mind, the world was turned upside down—the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—nothing was not distorted.</p>

The way does not maintain the burdens of past care, yet each meets their end in sequence; this is the skill of a wise physician, hence harmony and stability. The method of dispelling ailments lies in no other but in employing the wise. </p>
<p>The poem says: There are the blind, there are the blind, in the courtyard of Zhou. They are the remnants of Zhou&#39;s rule. The ruler&#39;s ailments number twelve; without a wise physician, no one can cure them. What are these twelve ailments? They are atrophy, stumbling, reversal, swelling, fullness, obstruction, blindness, agitation, breathlessness, paralysis, and turmoil. How does a wise physician treat them? By reducing burdens and lightening punishments, atrophy does not arise; by preventing the common people from suffering hunger and cold, stumbling does not occur; by preventing wealth from being hoarded, reversal does not happen; by ensuring granaries do not rot, swelling does not develop; by keeping treasury and storage full, fullness does not ensue; by not allowing ministers to indulge, obstruction does not manifest; by ensuring lower sentiments reach the upper echelons, blindness does not occur; by showing care for the lower classes, agitation does not transpire; by implementing laws diligently, breathlessness does not arise; by preventing resentment from below, turmoil does not manifest; by not allowing the wise to hide away, paralysis does not occur; and by preventing the people from singing and defaming, turmoil does not arise. </p>
<p>The high officials and ministers are the core members of the ruler&#39;s body. If these core members are free from ailments, then the ruler is also free from ailments. Thus, without a wise physician, no one can heal. If everyone suffers from these twelve ailments and does not employ the wise, then the nation is no longer its own. The poem says: Many will be deeply entrenched and beyond remedy; ultimately, they will perish.

When in the presence of the ruler, the nobles and guests celebrated. The disciples and the gathered guests offered cures. One disciple remarked: &#39;The reason for presenting remedies is because of illness. Now that Liang Qiu has recovered, why do the scholars again offer remedies? Do they suspect that Liang Qiu will encounter another snake bite and therefore wish to apply them?&#39; Everyone sat in silence with no reply. What do you think of this disciple&#39;s statement?&quot; Confucius replied: &quot;Your assertion is incorrect. A good doctor often experiences three failures before succeeding. Given that Liang Qiu encountered a snake bite and recovered, he must think of those who share his ailment and will certainly inquire about the remedies. For this reason, everyone is discussing different remedies, wanting to sell their knowledge to those in need. Those who mention their remedies claim they are good as a way to compare the quality of their cures.&quot;</p>
<p>In the text from &quot;Xin Yu&quot;: In the past, Bian Que lived in Song, but fell into disfavor with the ruler, and fled to Wei. In Wei, there was a person gravely ill nearing death. When Bian Que arrived at their home to treat him, the patient&#39;s father said: &quot;My son is critically ill and will have a renowned doctor come to treat him; you cannot help him.&quot; He sent Bian Que away. Instead, he summoned a spirit medium to seek blessings and incantations, cursing Bian Que. The patient eventually died, and the spirit medium could not heal him. Bian Que was renowned as the best doctor in the world but could not compete with the spirit medium. Those who sought distant help overlooked what was near, hoarding vast resources while neglecting what was right in front of them; this is what it means!<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian,&quot; the biography of the sun states: Jia Yi said, &quot;I have heard that the ancient sages, who did not reside in the court, would surely be found among the physicians and diviners.&quot;</p>
<p>In the &quot;Explanation of Names,&quot; it elaborates on appearances: &quot;Pulse diagnosis&quot; is akin to skilled deception. When a physician feels another&#39;s pulse, they understand the nature of the illness and make a corresponding diagnosis.</p>
<p>Explanation of diseases: &quot;Rash&quot; signifies diagnosis. If there is a knot in the energy, it can be diagnosed and discerned.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Book of Yue,&quot; it states: &quot;If one dies without seeking a physician, or a nation falls without strategizing, they are merely inviting disaster upon themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>In the &quot;Discourses on Salt and Iron,&quot; it is said: &quot;Bian Que cannot restore flesh and bones; neither can a minor official maintain a fallen state.&quot; </p>
<p>Bian Que cannot treat diseases that reject acupuncture and medication; wise and virtuous individuals cannot correct a ruler who ignores admonitions and criticisms. </p>
<p>What is valued in a good physician is their ability to discern information and expel evil energies, not merely their skill in inserting needles and piercing the skin. </p>
<p>Officials are not considered good based on making many judgments; physicians are not deemed skilled based on making many incisions. </p>
<p>Bian Que knows the origins of illnesses by feeling the pulse — when yang energy is strong, it depletes and harmonizes with yin; when cold energy is strong, it depletes and harmonizes with yang. Thus, the energies balance, and evil energies find no place to reside. </p>
<p>However, an inept physician does not grasp the principles of pulse intricacies and the divisions of blood and energy, recklessly stabbing without benefit to the illness, causing only harm to the skin. </p>
<p>Now, to reduce the excess and supplement the deficient, the rich become richer, and the poor become poorer. Strict laws and harsh punishments aim to curb violence and stop wickedness, yet wickedness persists. The implication is that it is not Bian Que&#39;s needles and stones that are in play; thus, the people fail to fulfill their roles.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the &quot;Thoughts on the Worthy&quot; from the &quot;Essays of the Hidden Scholar&quot;: Those who share the same plight as the dead cannot thrive, and those who walk alongside a fallen nation cannot endure. Is this merely empty talk? How can we know a person is unwell? It is because they do not crave food. How can we know a nation is about to fall into chaos? It is because they do not value the worthy. Therefore, in the household of a sick person, it is not that there are no fine dishes, but the person is unable to eat them, which leads to death. In the government of a chaotic nation, there are not no virtuous people, but the ruler is unable to employ them, resulting in its downfall.</p>
<p>To live on fine rice and drink sweet wine is to nourish life. Yet a sick person loathes these, thinking them inferior to beans, wheat, and drinking clear broth; this is an omen of impending death. To respect the worthy and employ the capable, to trust the loyal and accept advice, is the foundation of security. Yet a blind ruler despises this, believing it is inferior to flattering sycophants; this is a sign of imminent destruction. Laozi said: &quot;Only the ailing are ill, thus they do not suffer.&quot; The Book of Changes states: &quot;Their loss, their loss, is tied to the mulberry.&quot; Therefore, those who cultivate longevity begin with treating illness through medicine; those who nurture a realm begin by restoring order through employing the worthy, thus they can keep themselves secure and their nations thriving.</p>
<p>The highest physician treats the nation; the next, the illness. Governing a nation is akin to caring for one’s own body; sickness pertains to the body, chaos pertains to the state. The body’s ailments await a physician for recovery; a nation’s chaos awaits the worthy for restoration.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To govern the body, there is the method of the Yellow Emperor; to govern the world, there are the teachings of Confucius. However, when illnesses go untreated and chaos remains unaddressed, it is not due to errors in the acupuncture or medicinal practices, nor are the words of the Five Classics misleading; rather, it is because those who apply them are unworthy. If unworthy, then measures are not circular, standards are not square, ropes are not straight, and plumb lines are not level. Drilling will not produce fire, striking stone will not yield gold, a golden horse cannot be chased for speed, and an earthen boat cannot cross water. All these eight are aspects of Heaven&#39;s way, observable in form; if one is unworthy, still achieving nothing, how much less can one expect to wield the Way of governance and steer the hearts of the people, riding the six dragons? Governing the world without true worthies is akin to treating illness without good physicians. In treating illness, one must have ginseng, but instead receives pigweed; one must have ophiopogon, but instead steams common wheat. If one fails to recognize the genuine and mixes remedies, the illness exacerbates without realizing one has been deceived. Consequently, one mistakenly believes the prescriptions are insincere and that medicines are useless for the illness, thus discarding later remedies and daring not to ingest them, instead only seeking shamans—even if facing death, this is acceptable. Rulers should seek worthy individuals and respond with humility and truth, not to promote their own agenda, and should not draw true worthies into base positions. When the country is in turmoil, they do not realize they are deceived by the inferior. One thus mistakenly claims the classics are untrustworthy and that virtue is of no benefit for rescue, abandoning the true words and no longer seeking improvement, instead relying on common officials—even facing ruin, this is acceptable. Below the Three Dynasties, all used pigweed with steamed common wheat in their prescriptions, leading to increasing illness and eventual death.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

<p>In &quot;Shen Jian&quot;: Medicine heals; it is used to treat illness. If there is no illness, there is no need for medicine. Just as meat cannot endure excessive food, how can it endure medicine? Cold leads to heat, and excessive heat can cause stagnation of yin. The use of medicine must be appropriate, otherwise it becomes harmful.

<p>When Zhang Qiu conducted his duties, he inquired about the way to govern the people from a wise man. The wise man advised him, saying: &quot;Why not heal?&quot; Zhang Qiu asked: &quot;What do you mean?&quot; The wise man replied: &quot;When the world lacks proper governance, the emperor suffers from a false sense of grandeur, feudal lords become negligent, the common people face hunger, high officials fall prey to greed, and those in power engage in corruption. Those dismissed from office court favor from influential powers with harmful agendas. A state is like a home; when there are dangers both above and below, turmoil and attacks will arise, and the nation will be in peril. If you wish to govern the people, healing is all that is needed.&quot; Zhang Qiu asked: &quot;How do I heal?&quot; The wise man replied: &quot;You can use benevolence and righteousness as medicine, and governance and education as broth. First, heal the illnesses of the rulers, then address the ailments of the feudal lords and commoners. Would that not be virtuous?&quot; Zhang Qiu responded: &quot;This is the art of healing from the master; how can the disciple dare to do this?&quot; The wise man concluded: &quot;Fear not, for by healing the feudal lords, if they recover, the nation will not be in danger.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>From this, we can see that the relations of scholars with feudal lords are akin to the relationships of physicians with their patients; they cannot be separated. Yet the Master asks, is it not out of desire for the Jin people that I release myself? One might ask: How can one consider the scholar&#39;s interaction with the lords? </p>
<p>In ancient times, there was a man from Zheng who suffered from a serious illness for three years without leaving his house. Someone advised him, saying: &quot;Your illness is grave; should you not seek a good doctor to cure you?&quot; He replied: &quot;The market has no good doctors; what can I seek?&quot; The advisor said: &quot;There is a good doctor in Chu; if you offer him a hundred pieces of gold, he will certainly travel a thousand miles to help you.&quot; The man from Zheng indeed obtained the good doctor from Chu and was cured.</p>
<p>Thus, the physician does not seek out illness to treat; rather, it is the ailing who seek out the physician. Therefore, for the scholar, it is likewise the feudal lords that seek him out; he does not seek the lords for his connections. My acceptance of the Jin king’s invitation is like the Chu physician receiving the gold from the man of Zheng. When the man of Zheng received the physician, he was cured; if the Jin king does not achieve a cure from me, am I not similar to that physician from Chu? It is both a matter of trust and distrust. Now, the party strife has again made things difficult at court, and the illness of the royal family seems more severe than that of Jin already!<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The king of Shu was delighted to see the ambassador, but upon hearing of his illness, he suddenly became distressed and went to his door with a single cart. The ambassador knew the king had arrived and closed the curtains to rest, commanding Li Yuanhou to wait at the steps. The king, upon seeing Li Yuan, inquired, &quot;Is the ambassador unable to come out?&quot; Li Yuan replied, &quot;He is unable.&quot; The king asked, &quot;May I enter to see him?&quot; Li Yuan answered, &quot;He has already fallen asleep, wait until he wakes, then you may ask to enter.&quot; The king then asked, &quot;Is it possible that the ambassador suffers from a pestilence?&quot; Li Yuan replied, &quot;Pestilence is not an illness.&quot; The king said, &quot;Then what is it?&quot; Li Yuan explained, &quot;It is known that heaven considers a subtle deficiency as illness, and the earth regards collapse and overflow as illness. The Son of Heaven sees hidden severity as illness, while kings and nobles perceive arrogance and extravagance as illness. Scholars consider poverty and difficulty as illness, and high officials regard cruel flattery as illness, while common people see hunger and cold as illness. Thus, the ambassador&#39;s illness is difficulty. The state does not promote the worthy, leaving scholars in distress, confined on the roads, with many chariots and official robes accompanied by packs of wolves, and the rich surrounded by dogs and swine. From this perspective, how can a scholar be free from illness? Indeed, illnesses arise from subtle deficiencies and collapses, thus heaven and earth employ sages as healers; illnesses from hidden severity and arrogance prompt the Son of Heaven and nobles to utilize worthy individuals as healers; illnesses of poverty and difficulty lead scholars to seek guidance through dreams; illnesses of cruel flattery urge high officials to seek wise rulers; and illnesses of hunger and cold cause common people to rely on diligent officials as healers. Hence, the ambassador&#39;s illness is one that medicine and stones cannot remedy, and ghosts and deities cannot torment; neither cold nor heat can invade it. It shows in his countenance yet remains unseen in his decay, resonates in his voice yet is not visible in his sorrow. He sings with the drum and lute yet does not express his joy, sighs by the riverbank yet does not reveal his worries—this constitutes the ambassador&#39;s illness.&quot;<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>&quot;Thank You for the Medicine&quot; by Liu Xiaochuo of the Liang Dynasty:</strong> A very small matter can cause a delay in growth. Renowned doctors take medicine from the city. Even though shamans observe symptoms, and famous doctors administer acupuncture, treasures such as pine nuts and jade broths—that is to say, one might be embarrassed by the multitude of precious offerings.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Family Instructions of Yan&quot;:</strong> In the matter of medicine, achieving subtlety is exceedingly difficult. I do not encourage you all to set your lives on it. By understanding the properties of medicine, even a small blend can be used in emergencies at home; this is also a worthy accomplishment, as were Huangfu Mi and Yin Zhongkan.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Central Discussion&quot;:</strong> The ailment of the inner gate does not manifest as pain, itch, or distress of the body; feelings and wisdom may lead one to be unaware of the depth of the illness. However, when the period arrives, the vital energy is suddenly exhausted, thus illnesses of the inner gate can lead to sudden death, which is what Bian Que detested the most. This is because Lu Yi could not distinguish it, and those who encounter it cannot attack it.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Miscellaneous Records of the Court and Countryside&quot;:</strong> Each doctor claims that a tiger struck by a medicinal arrow will eat pure mud to detoxify; a wild boar struck will peck at the jiachi (a plant). If animals know how to administer detoxifying medicine, how much more so humans? Jiachi is the same as sand ginseng, as stated in the &quot;Erya&quot; which calls it zhìni.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>&quot;Li Shi Kan Wu&quot;:</strong> A physician who can discern life and death from reading pulses, if not endowed by heaven, has achieved this through accumulated learning. Initially, there may be skill, but ultimately, effectiveness diminishes. Scholars argue that in the beginning, skill is linked to the ability to command life, while in the end, it is related to the limitations of numbers. I say: not so. In the beginning, when one often succeeds, they delight in accumulating wealth; their memory is sharp, and their diagnostic skills are keen. As time passes, however, the muscles tire, willpower wanes, and the effectiveness becomes rare. The distinction between beginning skill and lacking later becomes evident here. If it is merely about numbers and their ebb and flow, can we truly say it reveals understanding of principles?</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Han Yu Zaoshuo&quot;:</strong> A good physician does not concern himself with whether a person is thin or fat; he only observes whether their pulse indicates illness. A wise strategist does not regard the stability or danger of the world but observes the principles of order and chaos. The world consists of people. Stability and danger equate to fatness or thinness. The principles of order are the pulse. If the pulse is healthy, being thin is not harmful. If the pulse is ill but one is fat, they are doomed. Those who understand this perspective comprehend what it means to govern the world. During the decline of the Xia, Yin, and Zhou dynasties, the princes rose and waged war incessantly. For decades, the world did not collapse due to the continuity of order. When the Qin unified the world and did not allow any power to the princes, they amassed troops and set fire to them. The world collapsed in just two generations due to the lack of orderly principles. Therefore, even if the extremities are free of illness, they cannot be relied upon; it is solely about the pulse. Even if the world is at peace, it cannot be a source of pride; it is only about the principles of order. Concern for what can be relied upon and fear of what can be boasted of — this is what the good physician and wise strategist call heavenly support. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: &quot;Look at the foot and examine the auspicious signs.&quot; A good physician and wise strategist will do this.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;On the Waking Words of Pine and Willow&quot;: People consume the five flavors to nourish the five vital energies; when afflicted, one alters the flavor and the energy diminishes, thus remedies are employed to restore balance to the flavors. This is the way of humanity, where rulers and subjects, parents and children, nurture one another; mulberry and hemp, grains and millet support one another. When there are violent people born among them, infringing upon the weak and offending the noble, it is necessary to correct this through punishment. In severe cases where factions grow strong and rebel against authority, military action is required to subdue them, allowing for order among the people. If there is no affliction, then medicine should not be tried; if the violent cease, then punishment can be reduced and military force can be restrained. Indeed, sweet flavors and rich fats, when overconsumed, harm one’s vital energy; how much more so with medicine? And how much more with those who apply wrong methods?<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>&quot;What I Saw in the Eastern Valley&quot;:</strong> Nowadays, the cost of herbal medicine is several times more than before for the cheap and common varieties, and for the more precious and refined ones, it is also several times higher than before. Even when carrying gold through the market, one may search for it without success; who does not know how difficult it is to obtain genuine medicine? Anyone who sets up a shop to peddle fake medicine is foolish. And those who wish to cure their ailments by purchasing fake medicine are even more foolish. What then should we do? We should be more cautious about our food and clothing. In ancient times, people prioritized diet and healthcare: in spring they consumed more sour foods, in summer more bitter, in autumn more pungent, and in winter more salty, balancing with smooth and sweet flavors. They maintained moderation in their diet, walking thirty steps after meals, thereby avoiding the need for a pharmacy. Careful eating and dressing is essential. If someone were to suffer from a disease and insists on following the notion of not taking medicine from a doctor, the expensive herbal remedies would not harm them. Especially dutiful children and loving grandchildren who care for their parents at home—how could they bear to watch them suffer without providing help? If a family has resources, they can still find good remedies; but if one is poor, what can they do? The poor indeed find it hard to obtain quality remedies, and the rich, even if they find good ones, may not necessarily have good doctors. Reflecting on this, I look up to the heavens and wish: may all people in the world find peace and happiness!<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>&quot;Miscellaneous Sayings of Aici&quot;:</strong> Aici served the King of Qi. One day, he appeared in court with a worried expression, and the king, puzzled, asked him about it. Aici replied: &quot;I am unfortunate; my young child is ill, and I wish to report this, thinking that the king has no one to assist with these matters. Although I am in court, my heart is truly concerned.&quot; The king said: &quot;Why not speak earlier? I have good medicine; if the child takes it, he will recover.&quot; He then instructed to provide it to Aici. Aici bowed in acceptance and returned, giving it to his son, who took it and died shortly after. On another day, Aici was deeply mournful, and the king asked the reason. He replied with sorrow: &quot;Your servant has lost a child!&quot; The king granted him gold to assist with the burial. Aici said: &quot;A deceased child is not deserving of royal gifts, yet I have something to request.&quot; The king asked: &quot;What do you seek?&quot; Aici replied: &quot;I only seek the method that was effective for my young child previously.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Expounding on Brocade and Dew&quot;:</strong> In medicine, there is a method of pressing and rubbing; the pressing involves using hands to knead the affected area, while rubbing involves rolling and massaging it.

In the &quot;Jade Compendium,&quot; there is no character for &#39;press&#39; under the hand section. In the &quot;Broad Rhyme,&quot; the character for &#39;press&#39; appears, but is derived from &#39;talent.&#39; The character for ‘case’ is derived from &#39;wood,&#39; noted as being related to &#39;table.&#39;<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

Whenever he saw friends storing medicinal elixirs, he would consume them without regard to quantity, sometimes without informing the host. The host would be alarmed and hastily warn against excessive intake, while Zhang laughed dismissively, yet it did not cause harm. This was due to a discrepancy in disposition, others could not replicate it.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;In the &#39;Bo Zhai Bian&#39;: A man from Shu, Shi Cang, made a name for himself in the capital with his medical skills. Another from Youyang, Chen Cheng, also became notable in medicine. However, Shi favored warming medicines while Chen preferred cooling ones. The good doctors of old would measure the strengths and weaknesses of a patient, observe the yin and yang of the illness, and then prescribe remedies, either to tonify or drain according to the condition. Yet these two hold their own biases, categorizing everything into hot and cold, and both gained renown in their time. Why? There is a saying: Shi Cang uses three dou of fire from the eaves, while Chen Cheng relies on a plate of ice in his chest. Those who take mineral medicines secretly use the power of the drugs to satisfy their desires, yet they often tend to avoid discussing it. When an illness suddenly arises, even if they wish to keep it hidden, they cannot. Wu Jingyuan from Wuxing took sulfur—few knew of it. Twenty years later, his son Tuo was made an official in Huating and died due to a back ailment, revealing the lingering toxicity that affected even his son. Should one not heed this?</p>

This is like a hunter who does not know rabbits, spreading nets across fields in the hope of catching one; the method becomes superficial. If one medicine coincidentally encounters another flavor that counteracts it, it cannot exert its full potency.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>From &quot;Yunlu Manchao&quot;</strong>: In medical texts, the human pulse is described as having three parts: the cun, guan, and chi. The area beneath the high bone at the back of the palm is the cun, below this is the guan, and below that is the chi. From the high bone down to the point where the cun pulse can be felt, that is the cun; thus above the point at which the chi pulse can be felt up to the tip of the middle finger, isn’t that the chi? The ancients used the body as a measure, hence they expressed it in terms of the pulse. However, modern doctors merely bend the middle finger, using the ends of two lines as the cun, or they measure length with the hand on the side. Although they are not far apart, when asked how to name the pulse as cun or chi, they cannot answer.</p>

There was no resolution in the world for this. Later, the father from the eastern neighboring state found writings in Huan&#39;s pillow and presented them as evidence, and thus the eldest son&#39;s techniques began to spread throughout the world.

Therefore, in disputes about chickens, there are proofs of beans and grains; in disputes about cattle, there are proofs of release; in disputes about thieves, there are proofs of touching the bell.

When a patient has weak spleen and stomach qi, they cannot digest food, not because of lack of grinding. The &quot;Jia Yu&quot; states: for those that gnash and swallow, they have eight orifices and are born from eggs; for those that grind their teeth, they have nine orifices and are born from live birth. Eggs and live births are fundamentally different, and so are the spleens and stomachs. Yet, medical practitioners do not comprehend this principle and speak generally, despite many through history, none have gained insight into this matter.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Yu Xiao Ling Yin,&quot; it is recounted: In the past, Duke Wen&#39;s two servants entered into the vital organs, and Bian Que identified it; Empress Cui of the Qin entered the spiritual realm, and Xu Zhi Cang recognized it. This was not due to an examination of their ailments, but rather a diagnosis of their hearts.</p>
<p>In &quot;San Yu Zhuibi&quot;: It is said that old doctors are valued more than young diviners, as the former are esteemed for their experience while the latter are prized for their youth. Old doctors all understand this, yet when asked about the meaning, young diviners cannot explain it. According to Wang Yanfu&#39;s &quot;Chen Shi,&quot; age brings experience, while youth brings decisive action. Thus, we know that this saying has existed for a long time.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Once there was a physician who claimed to be able to treat hunchbacks, saying: &quot;Like a bow, like a shrimp, like a curved ring, extend my treatment, and one can be cured in the morning and stand straighter by evening.&quot; A man believed him and sought treatment for his hunchback. The physician took two boards, placing one on the ground and having the hunchback lie on it, then placed the other board on top and pressed down. The hunchback straightened, but also died. The man&#39;s son wanted to report this to the authorities, but the physician said: &quot;I aim to straighten hunchbacks; I don’t concern myself with whether people live or die.&quot; Alas! In the world today, those in power only care about taxes and resources, indifferent to the lives of the common people. How is this different from that physician?

<p><strong>&quot;Private Thoughts on Herbalism&quot;</strong>: During the time of Shennong, common people sought medicinal beasts. When someone fell ill, they would caress the beast and convey words to it. The words were as transmitted by the common people, and their meaning was unknown. Once the words were spoken, the beast would immediately act like it was in the wild, picking a herb with its mouth, crushing it for juice, and taking it to recover. Later, the Yellow Emperor commanded Feng Hou to record which herbs arose for which diseases; after a long time, the formulas were fully verified. There is an ancient saying that the Yellow Emperor once tried all the herbs, which is not true. Therefore, Yu Qing said: the Yellow Emperor learned medicine from the beasts.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Questions of Tang&quot; in Liezi</strong>: Duke Hu of Lu and Qi Ying of Zhao both fell ill and sought treatment from Bian Que. After Bian Que treated them, they both recovered. He said to Duke Hu and Qi Ying: &quot;Your previous ailments were caused by external disturbances affecting your internal organs, due to the effects of herbs and stones. Now there is a coexisting ailment that ages with the rites; what would happen if we attacked it together?&quot; The two replied: &quot;We wish to first hear your findings.&quot; Bian Que told Duke Hu: &quot;Your will is strong, but your vitality is weak, which makes you full of plans but lacking in decisive actions; Qi Ying has a weak will but strong vitality, leading him to think little yet be harmed by fixation. If we exchanged your hearts, then both would attain balance in virtue.&quot; Bian Que then made the two drink poisoned wine, which caused them to be in a stupor for three days. He opened their chests and examined their hearts, switched them, and administered divine medicine. Once they awoke as before, the two departed for home. Duke Hu returned to Qi Ying&#39;s home and found his wife and children, who did not recognize him; Qi Ying likewise returned to Duke Hu&#39;s home where his wife and children also did not recognize him.

By the third toss, the flames were golden, and when poured out, they appeared purple-gold. He then consumed one circle and sent the physician to explore Chengdu, hoping to encounter it again.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Jiangnan, a government official named Shen Zhang Yi was suffering from a fever and was in distress, feeling extremely bewildered. He saw a divine figure, about several inches tall, standing before his pillow, holding three pills and saying, “Swallow these, and you will recover.” Yi took the pills and quickly swallowed two of them, while the third one fell to the ground with a sound. He then got up to look for it, but couldn’t find it. His family, startled, asked what had happened. He recounted his vision, and his illness was immediately cured. That same day, he went out into the streets with no suffering at all.</p>
<p>The &quot;Records of Cao Prefecture&quot; state: In the early years of the Jiajing era, a local person named Wu Shiyu Kai, who was only a few years old, was afflicted with a severe illness that caused him great torment, and he felt there was no hope for salvation. One night, he suddenly had a dream where a man in a yellow cap came to him, urging him to get up. The man then used a knife to make an incision in his side, removing his intestines and stomach, cleaning and washing them, and then putting them back, applying an ointment on the outside. When Kai woke up, he immediately felt an extraordinary coolness and relief in his chest and was so amazed that he told his father about the dream. His father, touching his abdomen, found that most of the mass had already subsided. Elated and pondering, he said, “Surely, a divine healer has shown you mercy.” The next morning, he took Kai to the shrine of the Three Sovereigns, honoring various famous physicians, and, upon seeing the statue of the Real Man Sun, he pointed and said, “This is the one who treated my illness in the dream.” His father then offered sacrifices and renewed the shrine, and Kai was free from his ailment. After passing the imperial examinations, whenever he went on official tours, he would always visit the shrine to pay his respects, looking after its beams and pillars, maintaining and adorning it for the rest of his life.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;Liu Yunshan was a doctor during the Wanli period. At that time, his skills were not well-known, and he died thirty-seven years before his name began to be recognized. Chen Ziwun heard this and said: &#39;How strange! Can this be true?&#39; A guest replied: &#39;In Hangzhou, there was a wealthy family whose member was gravely ill and on the verge of death. His family had already gathered to mourn him when a doctor suddenly appeared, saying, &#39;I am Liu Yunshan.&#39; After examining him, the patient recovered. The doctor refused the gold offered in gratitude and said, &#39;We shall meet again in Piling City, in the alley of the Temple of the Minister.&#39; A month later, the wealthy family’s son sought out Liu Yunshan, but an elderly man in the alley said: &#39;You are mistaken! Liu Yunshan has been dead for thirty-seven years.&#39; However, during his lifetime, Yunshan believed in the gods and once dreamt that he was instructed by the god of this temple to collect money to expand the shrine, and he even had an image of himself created beside the deity, which still resembled him. The son of the wealthy family leapt forward, looked at the statue in shock, and left, weeping. From then on, people from our county would come to observe, worship, and pray, with daily crowds and apparent miracles occurring. Chen Ziwun heard this and said: &#39;How strange! Can this be true?&#39; Nevertheless, I believe that had Yunshan&#39;s skills been known during his lifetime, he would have fully realized his ambitions. Being burdened with his skills but not having the chance to showcase them, this is likely why Yunshan refused to be forgotten even in death. Though the story might seem bizarre or incredible, a gentleman should also empathize with his aspirations and give it some credence.&quot;<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In Shu, Liu Wenji recounted to me that in the past there was a so-called &quot;Old Immortal&quot; among the bandits, a remarkable figure who could bring dead people back to life and reattach severed limbs and bones. The bandits revered him as if he were a deity. Initially, when he was captured, they intended to kill him. However, they did not execute him immediately but instead spared anyone who had any skill or craft. The immortal was called &quot;the sculptor&quot; because he managed to be exempted thanks to his ability to sculpt figures out of clay. </p>
<p>One day, the sculptor was cleaning a large cauldron, pouring water and dismantling a house for kindling. The water boiled, bubbling over several times, and with a stick, he stirred it into a paste. The bandits were astonished and spread the word. When the leader of the bandits heard about it, he thought he was a sorcerer and decided to kill him. The sculptor said, “Allow me one word before death. Does the king not wish to accomplish great things? Why then kill an unusual man?” The bandit leader, intrigued, asked him to explain. The sculptor replied, “I possess a strange art: I can bring people back to life. This paste is granted by the immortals; whether by knife or axe, or even a severe injury, I can restore the severely wounded to full health in an instant.” The bandit leader then struck a person to test it, and it was immediately verified. The bandit leader was cruel and regularly killed people, inflicting various tortures without count.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Hundreds were flogged, their flesh and blood torn apart, barely alive. Those who were still breathing were handed over to the sculptor, who applied a white paste to them. All of them revived and were able to walk immediately afterward. In the army, many rushed to seek them, and every day food and drink were generously offered, thus gradually filling their clothes and bags. </p>
<p>One of the captured bandits had a favored general, who was struck by a flying stone during an attack and had his chin severed, barely breathing. The sculptor said, &quot;It&#39;s easy.&quot; He then cut off a person&#39;s chin and pressed it against the general&#39;s, applying paste; within a day, he recovered and could eat and drink as if he had never been injured. </p>
<p>At that time, Sun Kewang was overseeing the bandits as military supervisor. One night, inebriated, he killed a favored concubine, and by morning marched twenty miles, waking up filled with regret. On the way, he encountered the sculptor and jokingly asked, &quot;Was the military supervisor drunk last night? Why does he not look well?&quot; Kewang explained the situation, and the sculptor replied, &quot;Does the supervisor still think of that person? I will turn back and search for her.&quot; Kewang said, &quot;Alas! When the camp broke, the body was gone; I imagine it has been devoured by dogs or pigs. Where could we look?&quot; The sculptor said, &quot;If the supervisor orders me to search, what would dogs or pigs dare to eat a noble person&#39;s body?&quot; Kewang responded, &quot;Find me a rat! Are you trying to escape? I will send an officer to escort you to search.&quot; The sculptor laughed and said, &quot;What place is there to search? What could we possibly find?&quot; Kewang grew angry and exclaimed, &quot;Are you mocking me?&quot; The sculptor pointed to a nearby bundle and said, &quot;No need to search; right here it is.&quot;<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a></p></div>

Ke Wang rejoiced and cried out, startling the entire army, which was heard by the bandits. The bandit leader said: &quot;This is a divine being! We shall confer an honor upon him.&quot; Fearing that the masses would not understand, he ordered in the large camp by the Great Marsh that each soldier prepare a table for gathering at the vast plain the next day. At that time, the bandits numbered in the hundreds of thousands, and they prepared hundreds of thousands of tables, the highest one designated for worship of the divine being. </p>
<p>Then the sculptor was dressed in a deep robe, with a silk scarf on his head, and shoes with silk laces. The sculptor was six feet tall, broad forehead, wide face, with a beard, resembling the gods depicted in society. However, when commanded to ascend the platform, which was high and precarious, the sculptor hesitated and did not wish to climb. The bandit leader ordered the soldiers to each draw their bows with arrows aimed at him, saying: &quot;If you do not climb, we will shoot!&quot; The sculptor had no choice; when halfway up, trembling in fear, he felt like he was a target for a myriad of arrows, yet dared not stop, and forced himself to reach the top.</p>
<p>The bandit leader commanded the three armies to lower their bows and arrows, lining up to bow below, calling him &quot;Old Immortal&quot; three times. At that moment, the sound echoed through heaven and earth, and from then on, they no longer called him the sculptor, but all referred to him as &quot;Old Immortal.&quot; From this point, the Old Immortal also no longer lightly tried his craft.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

He sought treatment from an old immortal, who refused, saying it was not easy. The bandit cried out in sorrow, presenting gold and silk as offerings, but the old immortal waved them aside, saying: &quot;These are external possessions; I have no need for them. However, I cannot bear to see your injury. I have no son; can you take care of me?&quot; The bandit swore by heaven that he would serve him as a child for life. The old immortal calmly opened his pouch, took out a small saw, and sawing off about an inch from both ends of the injured leg, took a living person&#39;s leg bone, measured it, and connected the two, applying medicine. In just a few days, he was healed. From that point on, anyone in the bandit group who sought his medicine dared not offer extravagant gifts, and all vied to become his adopted son.</p>

The bandit leader, unaware it was &quot;Old Foot,&quot; suspected others were watching and struck her with his dagger, hitting her at the waist, breaking her bones and cutting open her abdomen, killing her. When the bandit leader realized, he was filled with regret and sorrow and urgently summoned the old immortal. The old immortal said: &quot;She is already dead; there is nothing to be done.&quot; The bandit leader scolded: &quot;Old cunning one, wasn&#39;t she one of the guards?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The traitor Xiang desperately wanted to preserve his life and set a deadline of three days. The old immortal requested a period of thirty-seven days. They combined wine with medicine and poured it into him. A sound like a clattering came from his throat when a dagger was used. The old immortal congratulated him, saying he could be saved and would recover in seven days. They then took water to moisten his intestines, filled his belly, stitched him up with a needle, applied medicine, reinforced him with wooden boards, and bound him with ropes. Indeed, after seven days, the old man walked as he normally would. When the traitor died, his followers scattered, fleeing from Shu to Dian. Those who had always respected the old immortal protected him and accompanied him to Dian. </p>
<p>When the Yongli reign began, many of the followers posed as false nobility. The old immortal boasted among the nobles, accumulating wealth, and set up a residence in the eastern corner of the city. He piled stones to form a mountain, dug a well to create a pond, planted flowers and trees around, and raised hundreds of red fish. When guests came, he would float white fish out of the water for amusement and, when drunk, would sing loudly and lie down, completely unconcerned. Until Yongli fled to Myanmar, the old immortal followed him. When they reached Tengyue, he often faced the sky, as if he had something to express. One day, he said to Wenji: &quot;I am old! What should I do?&quot; Wenji replied: &quot;Just wait for death, what do you care? But your unique skills, which you have never shared with others, will be lost.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Upon inquiring about the reason for his situation, he replied: I am a man of the Chen surname, from Dengzhou in Henan, born to a scholarly family. In my youth, I attended the local academy, but I was not fond of the classic texts. There was a statue of gods and Buddhas beside the school, which I often played with. The schoolmaster would occasionally reprimand me, and when I returned home, my parents would scold me for not studying, which I could not endure, so I decided to run away, feeling lost and with nowhere to go. I prayed to Guandi and received an oracle that said: &quot;In the future, you shall stand shoulder to shoulder with kings and lords.&quot; Looking at myself, a lost child of a fallen family, how could I stand shoulder to shoulder with kings and lords? Yet, the divinity did not deceive me; the only ones who stand shoulder to shoulder with kings and lords are the immortals. I had long heard that there are many hidden immortals in Zhongnan Mountain, so I wished to follow them. Enduring hunger and cold, I searched everywhere but could not find anyone to learn from. One day, I reached the back of the mountain and, from a distance, saw a cave in the sheer cliffs, with people entering and exiting. I pushed through the thorns, climbed the craggy rocks, and reached the cave, where I saw a Daoist sitting on a stone, serene and unlike ordinary people. I was fortunate to think: This must be my master! I thus knelt and begged for instruction. The Daoist did not look at me and waved his sleeve, returning to the cave. I did not dare to enter, so I bowed at the cave entrance instead. This happened for three days, when suddenly a young boy appeared, holding something and showing it to me, saying: ‘The master has sent you this to eat.’ It resembled a cake, was white, about two inches square, and tasted sweet like honey. After eating it, I was no longer hungry. I secretly rejoiced and became more convinced, continuing to worship and request guidance.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

After a while, the Daoist said, &quot;I see you are sincere. Here is a book; I will give it to you along with a lifetime&#39;s worth of provisions.

No physician could heal her, so a reward was offered for anyone who could, consisting of two hundred gold coins and a mule. I went to answer the call, followed the methods in the book, and indeed she recovered. I then returned home with gold in my pouch riding the mule. My father was angry and suspected I had acquired too much wealth. At that time, bandits had already risen, and they assumed I must have engaged in unjust acts, seeking to report me to the authorities. My elder brother, who was a government scholar, plead my innocence, emerging from jail to question what had happened and subsequently produced the book. Upon learning that I had come out, my father rushed to my brother&#39;s house wielding a big stick. My brother repeatedly explained the situation but was not believed, and presented the book as evidence. My father grew even angrier and tore the book to pieces, throwing it into the fire. My brother managed to retrieve only four pages from the flames, and I hurriedly hid them and fled.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>What is currently used is merely a remnant of what once existed. Over the years, even the four pages have been lost. This is how it is recounted. Before long, I died from illness. Alas! Not even a remedy from the hands of the gods could save me. One is destined for nobility, while the other does not escape the hands of thieves; the only difference lies in what we utilize. Similarly, if an elderly immortal can embody the will of their forebears and not succumb to thieves, holding onto these skills to navigate the world, then figures like Lu and Bian and Hua Tuo would not have been so prominent. It is a pity that those who become engrossed in wealth and profit mistakenly assume the title of immortal, only to ultimately perish at the hands of thieves. Nevertheless, whether a person encounters an immortal or not depends solely on the depth of their fortune and virtue. The old immortal who receives their text yet fails to preserve their fortune is evident. I once saw in a record that a certain Hou Yuan, having met an old man who taught him military strategies, ultimately became a thief and brought about his own demise; the story bears strong resemblance to this situation. I often wonder why immortals do not find their rightful recipients. If they keep their teachings secret, why do they so often pass them to the wrong people, resulting in harm? How could an immortal bear such consequences? Furthermore, the path of Zhongnan is not necessarily that of true immortals. It is said that their ointment is made by refining the oil of young maidens’ bodies, filling the room with firelight, flames rising to the beams, and as the light fades, the ointment is formed. Is this truly a method for saving people? Traditional medicine involves the extensive use of insects and fish, leading to a delayed rise of ten years. Moreover, killing people to save others is not limited to one or two individuals, but potentially dozens or hundreds; such a so-called old immortal is merely a thief from beginning to end.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a></p></div>

Hence, one should explore the extremes above and below, examine the five energies, establish the five movements, penetrate the essence of life, record the yin and yang, consulting deeply the teachings of Qi and Lei to create the \"Inner Canon.\" Careful observation of the timing leads to inscribing it on jade tablets to be stored in the chamber of the spirit of orchids.

Now, he did not recognize the past, nor did he recognize the present. His entire household was distressed by this. He consulted historians and tried divination, but it yielded no answers; he sought the help of shamans and prayed, but was met with no respite; he approached doctors and sought treatments, but it was futile. In Lu, there was a Confucian scholar who claimed he could cure him. Huazi's wife and children asked him to use half of their estate in exchange for a remedy. The scholar said: \"This is not something that can be determined by divination, nor through prayer, nor by medicine. I will try to transform his heart and change his thoughts, hoping for a cure.\" Thus, he experimented by exposing Huazi to light when he sought clothes, providing food when he was hungry, and seeking brightness when he was in darkness. The scholar joyfully told Huazi's children, \"The illness can be cured.\" However, I will not inform anyone of my secret method; let us keep it private for seven days. Following this, no one knew what he did. After many years of illness, on one morning, it all vanished. Once Huazi regained his senses, he became extremely angry, dismissed his wife, punished his children, and chased away the scholar. The people of Song caught him and questioned him. Huazi said: \"I used to forget, obliviously unaware of the existence or non-existence of heaven and earth. Now I have suddenly grasped the past and can remember losses and gains from decades, the sorrows and joys, all the tangled emotions arise within me. I fear that in the future there will be turmoil from losses and gains, sorrows and joys—my heart is like this.

The servant secured the medicine and hurried back, but as he approached the neighborhood, his horse stumbled and fell. The servant, fearing the master’s wrath and unable to return for more, went to a dye shop and begged for a bottle from the dye vat, deceiving the owner.

Upon seeing her, Tao’s heart was stirred and he told his son, \"Such a beauty will definitely bring harm.\" Yan was not favored by the Taiyuan family; now with this bait, they aim to benefit the clan. After just one meeting, she was sent away. A special envoy was afraid to return, waiting for Yan's instructions. Yan then poured out his blood in a letter to Tao, but Tao ultimately rejected the proposal and ordered the local officials to trade her.

The ruler's ailments number twelve; without a wise physician, no one can cure them. What are these twelve ailments? They are atrophy, stumbling, reversal, swelling, fullness, obstruction, blindness, agitation, breathlessness, paralysis, and turmoil. How does a wise physician treat them? By reducing burdens and lightening punishments, atrophy does not arise; by preventing the common people from suffering hunger and cold, stumbling does not occur; by preventing wealth from being hoarded, reversal does not happen; by ensuring granaries do not rot, swelling does not develop; by keeping treasury and storage full, fullness does not ensue; by not allowing ministers to indulge, obstruction does not manifest; by ensuring lower sentiments reach the upper echelons, blindness does not occur; by showing care for the lower classes, agitation does not transpire; by implementing laws diligently, breathlessness does not arise; by preventing resentment from below, turmoil does not manifest; by not allowing the wise to hide away, paralysis does not occur; and by preventing the people from singing and defaming, turmoil does not arise. The high officials and ministers are the core members of the ruler's body. If these core members are free from ailments, then the ruler is also free from ailments. Thus, without a wise physician, no one can heal. If everyone suffers from these twelve ailments and does not employ the wise, then the nation is no longer its own.

What do you think of this disciple's statement?\" Confucius replied: \"Your assertion is incorrect. A good doctor often experiences three failures before succeeding.

A sage king governs the people, a master craftsman governs horses, and a doctor governs illnesses—all use the same materials but seek their respective purposes.

Therefore, in the household of a sick person, it is not that there are no fine dishes, but the person is unable to eat them, which leads to death. In the government of a chaotic nation, there are not no virtuous people, but the ruler is unable to employ them, resulting in its downfall. To live on fine rice and drink sweet wine is to nourish life. Yet a sick person loathes these, thinking them inferior to beans, wheat, and drinking clear broth; this is an omen of impending death. To respect the worthy and employ the capable, to trust the loyal and accept advice, is the foundation of security. Yet a blind ruler despises this, believing it is inferior to flattering sycophants; this is a sign of imminent destruction.

Consequently, one mistakenly believes the prescriptions are insincere and that medicines are useless for the illness, thus discarding later remedies and daring not to ingest them, instead only seeking shamans—even if facing death, this is acceptable. Rulers should seek worthy individuals and respond with humility and truth, not to promote their own agenda, and should not draw true worthies into base positions.

In the beginning, when one often succeeds, they delight in accumulating wealth; their memory is sharp, and their diagnostic skills are keen.

A wise strategist does not regard the stability or danger of the world but observes the principles of order and chaos. The world consists of people. Stability and danger equate to fatness or thinness. The principles of order are the pulse. If the pulse is healthy, being thin is not harmful. If the pulse is ill but one is fat, they are doomed. Those who understand this perspective comprehend what it means to govern the world. During the decline of the Xia, Yin, and Zhou dynasties, the princes rose and waged war incessantly. For decades, the world did not collapse due to the continuity of order. When the Qin unified the world and did not allow any power to the princes, they amassed troops and set fire to them. The world collapsed in just two generations due to the lack of orderly principles. Therefore, even if the extremities are free of illness, they cannot be relied upon; it is solely about the pulse. Even if the world is at peace, it cannot be a source of pride; it is only about the principles of order.

A gentleman who governs a country has the responsibility to promote what is beneficial and eliminate what is harmful; one must carefully consider the circumstances of人才 (talent) when employing or dismissing them, right? In the \"Jianming Shu,\" it is said: In the world of medicine, when doctors see someone unable to eat or drink due to illness, they immediately say the spleen is not grinding. However, just note that waterfowl like ducks, geese, and chickens have no teeth in their mouths and cannot chew food; they need the spleen to grind it before they can digest. Thus, their spleens are all thick and hard. Humans, on the other hand, differ from other animals; they have teeth and can chew foods, so their spleens are soft and weak, primarily relying on the qi for transformation. When a patient has weak spleen and stomach qi, they cannot digest food, not because of lack of grinding. The \"Jia Yu\" states: for those that gnash and swallow, they have eight orifices and are born from eggs; for those that grind their teeth, they have nine orifices and are born from live birth. Eggs and live births are fundamentally different, and so are the spleens and stomachs. Yet, medical practitioners do not comprehend this principle and speak generally, despite many through history, none have gained insight into this matter. In the \"Yu Xiao Ling Yin,\" it is recounted: In the past, Duke Wen's two servants entered into the vital organs, and Bian Que identified it; Empress Cui of the Qin entered the spiritual realm, and Xu Zhi Cang recognized it. This was not due to an examination of their ailments, but rather a diagnosis of their hearts. In \"San Yu Zhuibi\": It is said that old doctors are valued more than young diviners, as the former are esteemed for their experience while the latter are prized for their youth. Old doctors all understand this, yet when asked about the meaning, young diviners cannot explain it. According to Wang Yanfu's \"Chen Shi,\" age brings experience, while youth brings decisive action.

I pushed through the thorns, climbed the craggy rocks, and reached the cave, where I saw a Daoist sitting on a stone, serene and unlike ordinary people. I was fortunate to think: This must be my master! I thus knelt and begged for instruction. The Daoist did not look at me and waved his sleeve, returning to the cave. I did not dare to enter, so I bowed at the cave entrance instead. This happened for three days, when suddenly a young boy appeared, holding something and showing it to me, saying: ‘The master has sent you this to eat.’ It resembled a cake, was white, about two inches square, and tasted sweet like honey. After eating it, I was no longer hungry. I secretly rejoiced and became more convinced, continuing to worship and request guidance."},{"anchor":"trans-79p","marker":"79p","type":"translation","text":"On the seventh day, the Daoist suddenly came out and asked me, \"Fool! What do you wish to do?\" I replied that I sought to become an immortal. The Daoist laughed and said, \"Go! You are not one of us, why do you torment yourself?\" I thought to myself that I had no place to return to, and that I might as well die by throwing myself off a cliff, so I wept and pleaded. After a while, the Daoist said, \"I see you are sincere. Here is a book; I will give it to you along with a lifetime's worth of provisions. Do not take it lightly, for if you reveal it, you will be struck by lightning. Leave quickly, and do not linger, for you will only be prey to tigers and wolves.\" I received the book with surprise and joy, hurriedly descending the mountain. Upon examining it, I found it was a collection of forbidden methods, about thirty pages long. In Yan'an, news spread that a certain governor had a beloved daughter who, while playing on a swing, had injured her foot with bones protruding. No physician could heal her, so a reward was offered for anyone who could, consisting of two hundred gold coins and a mule. I went to answer the call, followed the methods in the book, and indeed she recovered. I then returned home with gold in my pouch riding the mule. My father was angry and suspected I had acquired too much wealth. At that time, bandits had already risen, and they assumed I must have engaged in unjust acts, seeking to report me to the authorities. My elder brother, who was a government scholar, plead my innocence, emerging from jail to question what had happened and subsequently produced the book. Upon learning that I had come out, my father rushed to my brother's house wielding a big stick. My brother repeatedly explained the situation but was not believed, and presented the book as evidence. My father grew even angrier and tore the book to pieces, throwing it into the fire. My brother managed to retrieve only four pages from the flames, and I hurriedly hid them and fled."},{"anchor":"trans-80p","marker":"80p","type":"translation","text":"What is currently used is merely a remnant of what once existed. Over the years, even the four pages have been lost. This is how it is recounted. Before long, I died from illness. Alas! Not even a remedy from the hands of the gods could save me. One is destined for nobility, while the other does not escape the hands of thieves; the only difference lies in what we utilize. Similarly, if an elderly immortal can embody the will of their forebears and not succumb to thieves, holding onto these skills to navigate the world, then figures like Lu and Bian and Hua Tuo would not have been so prominent. It is a pity that those who become engrossed in wealth and profit mistakenly assume the title of immortal, only to ultimately perish at the hands of thieves. Nevertheless, whether a person encounters an immortal or not depends solely on the depth of their fortune and virtue. The old immortal who receives their text yet fails to preserve their fortune is evident. I once saw in a record that a certain Hou Yuan, having met an old man who taught him military strategies, ultimately became a thief and brought about his own demise; the story bears strong resemblance to this situation. I often wonder why immortals do not find their rightful recipients. If they keep their teachings secret, why do they so often pass them to the wrong people, resulting in harm? How could an immortal bear such consequences? Furthermore, the path of Zhongnan is not necessarily that of true immortals. It is said that their ointment is made by refining the oil of young maidens’ bodies, filling the room with firelight, flames rising to the beams, and as the light fades, the ointment is formed. Is this truly a method for saving people? Traditional medicine involves the extensive use of insects and fish, leading to a delayed rise of ten years. Moreover, killing people to save others is not limited to one or two individuals, but potentially dozens or hundreds; such a so-called old immortal is merely a thief from beginning to end."},{"anchor":"orig-1p","marker":"1p","type":"original","text":"古今图书集成医部全录卷五百二十 纪事 杂录 外编 纪事
