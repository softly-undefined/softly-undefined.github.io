<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Book of Changes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Without Falsehood Hexagram</strong></p>
<p>Nine in the fifth position: If one suffers from the malady of without falsehood, do not use medicine; there will be good fortune.<br>[Cheng&#39;s Commentary: When a person is ill, medicine and stones are used to expel the evil and nourish the right. If the vital energy is harmonious and there is no illness, then to attack and treat it will instead harm the right nature; thus, not using medicine brings good fortune. Good fortune refers to the illness disappearing by itself.] </p>
<p>The image states: The medicine of without falsehood cannot be tried.<br>[Cheng&#39;s Commentary: If a person has delusions, they must rectify the situation. If there is truly no delusion, but medicine is used to treat it, it becomes delusion again; how can it be used? Hence, it cannot be tried. To try means to use temporarily, somewhat like tasting it. The essence is that if there is already no delusion and one still uses medicine, it becomes delusion again and brings about illness. In the Great Complete Book, Zhang of the Xi family says: Without delusion yet ill, and without delusion yet medicated, it becomes delusion and causes illness again. This is why the medicine of without falsehood cannot be tried. Confucius said: &quot;I do not dare to taste it; the sage does not try the medicine of delusion thus.”]</p>
<p><strong>Book of Documents</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Command</strong></p>
<p>If the medicine does not cause drowsiness or dizziness, then the illness will not heal.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br>The Commentary by Confucius states: &quot;When taking medicine, one must experience extreme dizziness; only then can the illness be cured.&quot; The commentary explains that dizziness leads to a dazed state of mind. The &quot;Dialectics&quot; mentions that consuming medicine that is toxic, especially in the regions between Dongqi and Haidai, is referred to as &#39;dizziness&#39; or &#39;light-headedness.&#39; Guo Pu notes that &#39;dizziness&#39; is a common expression. Thus, the act of the medicine attacking the illness first causes a state of confusion, and only then can healing occur. When it is said that dizziness is extreme, it indicates that the medicine works only when the mind is deeply affected.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Book of Rites,&quot; it states: &quot;When a ruler is ill and takes medicine, a minister must first taste it. If a parent is ill and takes medicine, a child must first taste it. A doctor must not administer medicine without a lineage of three generations.&quot; The Great Compilation by the Yanling Fang clan asserts: &quot;In ordinary times, when the ruler is not engaged in affairs, the servants taste the dishes, and the crown prince personally observes; this is to maintain caution. Thus, during illness, it is even more critical not to neglect this practice. If a medical skill is not passed down from father to son, it will not be refined. If the skill is not refined, how can its medicine be taken? The Zhou official&#39;s minister teaches based on experience, which is why this is stated. However, what is mentioned in the classics merely describes the norm. As for those who acquire knowledge not through inheritance but through personal understanding, they may still be accepted within three generations. Therefore, the Zhou officials&#39; physicians only regard the perfectly comprehensive method as the best; if the knowledge is not passed to the right person, it is not accepted, even after three generations. Hence, Confucius remarked that those without constancy should not be allowed to serve as shamans or doctors.&quot; The &quot;Collected Commentaries&quot; by Zheng states: &quot;One must assess their own capacity; a doctor should not administer medicine unless it has been tried on three generations; cautiousness must be observed.&quot;<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br>Confucius said: When a person is ill, they must take medicine. If a father and son pass down their knowledge through three generations, they can avoid mistakes and maintain balance. Furthermore, it is said: the three generations refer to the &quot;Yellow Emperor&#39;s Acupuncture,&quot; the &quot;Shennong&#39;s Materia Medica,&quot; and the &quot;Sunu&#39;s Pulse Formula.&quot; Without studying these three ancient texts, one should not take their medicine.</p>
<p>Lü of Lantian said: Confucius emphasized caution regarding diseases, warfare, and calamities. Disease is a serious matter. If one is not careful in the face of danger, they invite disaster, especially in the case of illnesses affecting one&#39;s ruler or parent. If a medicine makes one dizzy or fails to cure an illness, then the medicine aimed at curing the illness is never without toxicity. Preferences or aversions may lead to harmful outcomes, measuring doses may be inappropriate, and treating cold with heat or vice versa can have counterproductive effects. Mild misuse could worsen an ailment, and severe misuse could lead to death. As a subject or child, one must not use medicine without careful trial; there is no greater unfilial or disloyal act than that. This is why the heir is blamed for his ruler&#39;s assassination due to his failure to properly test the medicine.</p>
<p>Lü of Shanyin said: The knowledge passed down through three generations contains insights that cannot be easily discerned. The world says: the old practitioner provides experience, while the young one offers divination.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br><strong>Zhou Li</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tian Guan</strong></p>
<p>There are two upper physicians, four lower physicians, two officials, two historians, and twenty apprentices. </p>
<p><strong>[Commentary: Zheng Kangcheng said: The physician is the leader among doctors. Chen Hongfu said: The use of a person’s body, akin to that of heaven and earth, requires balance; excess leads to harm, and deficiency needs to be compensated, which is the way of heaven. Without an understanding of the principles of creation and the changes of fullness and emptiness, how could one know the specific conditions of a person&#39;s vital energy? This is indeed crucial to the smallest detail. How could later generations of mediocre physicians comprehend this matter, thus establishing Zhou with the gentlemen to oversee it?]</strong> </p>
<p><strong>[Xue Pingzhong said: From the cook to the butcher, cooks are interconnected in their duties, thus the position of food physician can also be aligned with them. It is special to place them among the physicians, truly reflecting the way a ruler protects and nurtures. However, the former kings did not want to indulge themselves at the expense of the people, which is why they appointed physicians ahead of food physicians; to manage diseases affecting the populace. After establishing food physicians, the roles of disease physicians, wound physicians, and animal physicians followed in sequence. Indeed, kindness originates from oneself and extends to the people, and concern for living beings truly arises from each sip and morsel.]</strong></p>
<p>The administration of medical affairs gathers poisonous substances for the purposes of medicine.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br>Liu Zhizhong said: The physician, who is in charge of medical affairs, must gather toxic medications, understand the suitability for different regions, know the appropriate times for collection, have methods for processing, and protocols for treatment. Only with complete knowledge can one participate in medical matters.</p>
<p>In any state with diseases, those with ulcers should be treated separately by physicians, and at the end of each year, their medical affairs should be reviewed to determine food provisions. Full marks are considered the highest; a loss of one in ten is acceptable, two in ten is a warning, three in ten is significant, and four in ten is deemed inferior.</p>
<p>Wang said: With adequate provisions recognized, the capable should encourage the incapable to strive.</p>
<p>Shi stated: Assessing losses and prioritizing efficiency, physicians fear their shortcomings deeply.</p>
<p>The two physicians overseeing dietary matters are responsible for the six types of food, drink, and culinary presentations under the king&#39;s regime, ensuring the meals of gentlemen are consistently exemplary.</p>
<p>Zheng Jieqing remarked: In ancient times, the historians, music officials, and those in charge of medicine and divination all dedicated themselves to their professions, refraining from overlapping roles to maintain precision. A physician does not exceed three generations in practice without proper medication.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br>Those who serve above with their skills find it particularly difficult in medicine; it is vital to be cautious concerning diseases. How could the ancient kings dare to rely on a single person to bear the skills of two or three? Therefore, beneath the physician, there are specialists for ailments, and dietary management does not overlap with treating illnesses; beneath the ailment physician, there are ulcer specialists, who examine internal conditions without overlapping with external signs; beneath the ulcer physician, there are veterinarians, treating animals without overlapping with humans. One must pursue excellence without wishing for superfluousness; this illustrates the benevolence of the ancient kings.</p>
<p>Among the physicians of ailments, there are eight specialists, responsible for the health of all people’s diseases by regulating the five flavors, five grains, and five medicines to nurture their ailments. </p>
<p>According to Zheng Kangcheng, the five medicines include herbs, trees, insects, stones, and grains. &quot;Nurture&quot; is akin to &quot;treat.&quot; Diseases arise from the balance of qi, so one must attack what is excessive and nurture what is deficient. As the Wang family stated, &quot;The Suwen says, when the form is insufficient, warm it with qi; when the essence is insufficient, replenish it with flavors.&quot; Flavors nurture the essence, grains nurture the form, and medicines treat the illnesses. Nurturing the essence is fundamental, nurturing the form is secondary, and treating diseases is the last priority. Lü&#39;s teachings suggest first using the five flavors and five grains, then following up with five medicines, acknowledging that treating with medicine comes last. Yet, is it only physicians who practice this? </p>
<p>Through the five qi, five sounds, and five colors, one discerns between life and death.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Jia states that internal illnesses are not visible to others; however, by observing a person&#39;s sounds and color, one can discern the severity of their condition. Wang further explains that by looking at their breath, listening to their sounds, and watching their color, one can determine life or death based on five indicators, and using food and medicine to treat the illness also follows this five-fold principle. Thus, changes in the body and movements of the internal organs can be regarded similarly. When people suffer from illness, they should be treated based on their specific conditions, and at the end of the year, each should document these for the physician.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Jia notes that for illnesses, there are eight skilled practitioners who specialize in treating them, necessitating a division in treatment. The eight practitioners responsible for treating ulcers and wounds manage the blessings, medications, cuts, and cauterizations involved in healing.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: It is my humble understanding that medical practices rely on blessings, which are perhaps reasonable. In contemporary times, some use techniques like sealing ulcers based on this traditional method. If the blessings do not help, medication is used; if the medicine is ineffective, cutting away the bad blood is necessary; if cutting does not heal, additional medication is required to remove the harmful tissue. Each method has varying degrees of applicability, hence it is said they are comparable.</p>
<p><strong>Spring and Autumn Annals, Four Commentaries</strong></p>
<p><strong>Xǔ Shìzǐ Resists Taking Medicine</strong>.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br>&quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;: In the 19th year of Duke Zhao&#39;s reign, in the summer of the fifth month on the day of Wuchan, the heir of Xu made an attempt to assassinate his lord, Mai. &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;: Duke Dao of Xu fell ill and took the medicine that the crown prince had prescribed, and ultimately the crown prince fled to Jin, where it was recorded: he assassinated his lord. A gentleman said: One should dedicate their heart and strength to serving their lord; it is permissible to forego medicine. Hu’s commentary on the Zuo tradition states that Duke Dao of Xu was ill and took the medicine prescribed by the heir; the record states he assassinated his lord because he did not try the medicine first. In ancient times, a physician would not administer medicine across three generations; one would not take medicine administered by others. The things the Master was cautious about were three, with illness being one of them. When Ji Kangzi sent medicine, he said: &quot;Qiu has not yet understood, therefore I dare not try it.&quot; If the lord is ill and drinks medicine, the minister must try it first; if the father is ill and drinks medicine, the son must try it first. This highlights the importance of caution. If one hastily uses medicine without choosing a proper physician, and advances medicine untested to the lord, this reflects a neglect of the lordly and paternal respect, showing a lack of caution. </p>
<p>[In the comprehensive account, Zhang says: The reason a medication might lead to death is manifold; thus, we speak of illness. Today&#39;s treatments for malaria involve arsenic and often lead to cures, however, improper preparation has led to many deaths. The death of Duke Dao must have been of this sort. Commentary states: According to the records, Duke Xu consumed the prescribed medicine and passed away, indeed not an assassination, but blaming the heir for not leaving behind the medicinal concerns suggests that one should trust the physician rather than administer it themselves. A filial son should perform with dedication and prayers only; the dosing of medicines is not something to be learned by experience. The heir of Xu served the nation, and the country was not without physicians; thus, hastily advancing medicine brought guilt akin to assassination, primarily to instruct on distant prevention.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor&#39;s Classic of Medicine</p>
<p>On the Treatise of Regulation of the Four Qi</p>
<p>The sage does not treat an already existing illness, but rather addresses the disease before it manifests; he does not remedy disorder after it has arisen, but instead seeks to prevent chaos beforehand. If one only administers medicine after the disease has developed, or intervenes after chaos has broken out, it is like digging a well when one is thirsty or forging weapons after a battle; is that not too late?<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br><strong>On the Discussion of Vitality and Its Communication to Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Chronic illness leads to transformation; if the upper and lower do not align, a skilled physician should not intervene. Therefore, when yang accumulates, illness can lead to death, and the yang energy becomes isolated. Isolation must be resolved, and if not promptly treated, it can lead to decline.</p>
<p><strong>On the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>A good pulse practitioner carefully examines the five internal organs and six bowels, observing their interplay: one goes against, one follows, noting the correspondence of yin and yang, surface and interior, and the balance of male and female. This is understood in the heart and aligns with essence. One should not teach the unworthy nor impart the untrue; this is called attaining the Way.</p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang Correspondences and Symbols</strong></p>
<p>In treating illness, one must seek the root cause. Therefore, if treatment does not conform to heavenly principles or does not follow earthly rationale, calamity will ensue. Hence, when an evil wind arrives, it comes swiftly like wind and rain. A skilled healer addresses the skin first, then the flesh, followed by the tendons, then the six bowels, and finally the five internal organs, as treating the five organs can be a matter of life or death.</p>
<p>Thus, an adept needle practitioner draws yin from yang and vice versa; they treat the right side with knowledge of the left and the left side with understanding of the right; they recognize the other by knowing the self, the exterior by understanding the interior, and they discern excess and deficiency. By observing subtle signs and avoiding misdiagnosis, they use treatment effectively without peril.</p>
<p>A skilled diagnostician examines color and takes the pulse, first distinguishing yin from yang, clarifying purity and turbidity to determine affected portions. They observe respiration, listen to sounds, and identify areas of suffering, assess balance and proportion, and discern the primary illness by their pulse examination, skillfully diagnosing symptoms without error, thus ensuring accuracy in treatment.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br><strong>Discussion of Yin and Yang</strong></p>
<p>To differentiate from Yang is to know the location of illness; to differentiate from Yin is to know the time of life and death. To differentiate from Yang is to know the contraindications of illness; to differentiate from Yin is to know the time of life and death.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of the Spiritual Orchid&#39;s Secret Classics</strong></p>
<p>The true way lies in the subtle, with endless transformations; who knows its origin? How perplexing! The dissipating element is elusive, who knows its essence? In a timely manner, who acts wisely? In the nebulous calculations, life emerges from minute details; the minutiae arise from measurements. Hundreds and thousands can lead to great benefits; extending it greatly, its form is accomplished. The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;Well said! I have heard of the path of essence and light, the great saint&#39;s undertaking, which clarifies the great way. It is not through fasting and selecting auspicious days that one can dare to accept it.&quot; The Emperor then chose auspicious days with good omens and stored the Spiritual Orchid in his chambers to pass it on and preserve it.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion of the Five Organs</strong></p>
<p>In treating illness, one must first examine the lower parts, match the pulse, observe the spirit and intentions alongside the illness. Those bound by spirits and deities cannot discuss ultimate virtue. Those averse to needles and stones cannot discuss ultimate skill. When illness does not permit treatment, it must remain untreated, for attempts to treat it will be in vain.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Transformation of Essence and Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;I have heard that in ancient times, curing illnesses relied solely on the transformation of essence and qi, and could be done through blessings. In today&#39;s world, diseases are treated with poisonous medicines for internal issues, and needles and stones for external troubles. Sometimes one recovers, sometimes not; why is this?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;In ancient times, people lived among beasts, moved to avoid the cold, and stayed still to escape the heat. Internally, they were free from emotional burdens, and externally, they were not burdened by social roles. This was a harmonious era, and thus, evil forces could not penetrate deeply. Therefore, poisonous medicines could not treat internal issues, and needles and stones could not address external troubles; hence, they could transform essence and bless as required. However, in today&#39;s world, it is not the same. Inner worries and external pains prevail, and people have lost harmony with the seasons, going against the natural flow of cold and heat. Harmful winds frequently arrive, and weakening evils come morning and night, penetrating the five organs and bones, injuring the skin and voids. Hence, minor ailments become severe, and major ailments lead to death; thus, blessings can no longer be effective.&quot; </p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to observe the conditions of patients, to see life and death, to resolve doubts, and to understand the essentials, like the light of the sun and moon. Can this be conveyed to me?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The colors and pulses are what the sovereigns value, and they were passed down by the earlier masters. In ancient times, practitioners used to study the color and pulse to connect with the divine, aligning with the five elements—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—and the four seasons, eight winds, and the six harmonies, never straying from the norm. They would adapt their understanding to observe the intricacies and grasp the essentials. To know the essentials, the colors and pulses are key.&quot;<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br>Color responds to the sun, and pulse responds to the moon; one consistently seeks the essence, and that essence is revealed. The changes in color reflect the seasonal energies; this is what the Supreme Deity values, aligning with the divine. Thus, one distances from death and approaches life, cultivating the path of existence, leading to the title of Sage King. </p>
<p>In ancient times, illness was treated by understanding its root. Boiling herbal liquids for ten days could dispel eight winds and five blockages. If illness persisted for ten days, one would then use the branches of herbal plants as aids. When the root cause was addressed, the harmful energies yielded.</p>
<p>However, in the later ages, treatment deviated from the four seasons, lacking an understanding of the sun and moon, and misjudging the trends of illness. When the symptoms were already established, they would seek to treat superficially with needles and internally with herbal liquids, using coarse methods rashly, believing they could attack the illness. As a result, the illness would persist, and new ailments would arise.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear the essential principles!&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The essence of treatment lies in ensuring no neglect of color and pulse. If one uses it without confusion, they achieve great results. Following or going against the natural order, if the root cause isn’t addressed, the spirit is lost and the state falls. By discarding the old and embracing the new, one can attain the status of a true human.&quot;</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;I have heard its essence from my teacher. My teacher spoke of color and pulse, which is what I know.&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The pinnacle of treatment lies in unity.&quot; The Emperor asked: &quot;What do you mean by unity?&quot; Qi Bo said: &quot;Unity arises from understanding. The Emperor asked: &quot;How can this be achieved?&quot; Qi Bo said: &quot;Close the doors and block the windows; inquire deeply about the patient&#39;s situation, to align with their intention. Those who gain the spirit thrive, while those who lose the spirit perish.&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;Excellent.&quot;<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Decoctions and Fermented Liquor</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: In ancient times, sages created decoctions and fermented liquors but did not use them; why is that? Qi Bo replied: Since ancient times, sages made these drinks as preparations. In ancient times, decoctions were made but not consumed. During the Middle Ages, the virtues declined slightly, and evil energies arrived, hence they were consumed for complete healing.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: In today’s world, is it unnecessary to do so? Qi Bo replied: In the present age, one must directly attack poison with medicines for internal issues, while using needles and stones to treat external afflictions.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about when the body is weak and blood is exhausted, and yet the treatment does not take effect? Qi Bo replied: This is because the spirit is not responsive. The Emperor asked: What does it mean that the spirit is unresponsive? Qi Bo replied: It refers to the methods of needles and stones. If the spirit does not advance and one&#39;s will is not directed toward healing, the illness cannot be cured.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: When an illness first manifests, it is extremely subtle and refined; it must first be lodged within the skin. Today, skilled doctors all say that when an illness is fully manifested, it is termed a reverse condition, hence needles and stones cannot treat it, nor can good medicines reach it. Nowadays, skilled practitioners have their methods and adhere to their practices, relatives and friends hear sounds daily, and they see colors every day, yet the illness does not heal; what flaw remains unaddressed? Qi Bo replied: The illness is the root, and the practitioner is merely the branch. Without grasping the root, the evil energy will not subside. This is what it means.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br><strong>On Pain Discourse</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that those who articulate the heavenly truths must have their evidence in human experience; those who speak of the ancients must align with the present; those who discuss humanity must have a profound understanding of themselves. If so, then the Way is clear and the essential truths become apparent, which is what is called clarity.</p>
<p><strong>On the Essentials of the Ultimate Truth</strong></p>
<p>Qi Bo said: The emergence of diseases comes from various sources; some arise from the root, some from the superficial, and some from the inner Qi. Some are derived from the root, some from the superficial, some from the inner Qi, and some from a combination of superficial and root causes. There are those that arise from oppositional forces and those that are derived from harmonies. Opposition is in contrast to harmony; what is harmonious can become oppositional. Therefore, it is said knowing the superficial and the root will ensure no peril in their application. Understanding opposition and harmony allows for righteous practice without inquiries. This is what is meant. Not knowing this is insufficient for diagnosis and leads to disruptions in the meridians. Hence, the essence states: Rough practitioners laugh it off as knowable. Words on heat have not yet ceased, and cold diseases begin anew. Similar emitted energies of different forms confound diagnoses and disrupt the meridians. This is what is meant. The Emperor said: All diseases arise from wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire; these transform and change. The classics say that the excessive should be drained, and the deficient should be supplemented. I bestow this to the practitioners, but they still have yet to achieve perfection. I wish to ensure that the essential Way is practiced; let the drums and gongs respond harmoniously, just like removing thorns and clearing dirt. Is there a skillful and divine method that can be shared? Qi Bo said: Careful observation of the condition of the disease must not neglect the critical energies. This is what is meant.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Medical Learning</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor sat in the Hall of Illumination and summoned Lei Gong to ask him, &quot;Do you know the way of medicine?&quot; Lei Gong replied, &quot;I can recite and somewhat understand, understand but cannot distinguish, distinguish but cannot clarify, clarify but cannot reveal. This is sufficient to treat advisors, but insufficient for lords and kings. I wish to receive the heavenly measure, to align with the four seasons and the interplay of yin and yang, to differentiate the stars and the light of the sun and moon, to clarify the teachings, so that future generations may understand them more fully.&quot; He connected with the teachings of Shen Nong and sought to convey this profound education, casting doubts on the two emperors. The Emperor said, &quot;Good. Don’t lose this understanding. All of this represents the interplay of yin and yang, the inner and outer principles, the complement of male and female, mutually responsive. Thus, those who understand the heavens above and the geography below, and the concerns of humanity in the midst can sustain this knowledge and teach the populace, without fear of danger. The teachings of medicine can be passed down for future generations and can become a treasure.&quot; Lei Gong said, &quot;Please allow me to receive this path, to recite and understand!&quot; The Emperor replied, &quot;If you were to receive the transmission without understanding the true way, you would confuse the teachings. I will convey to you the essence of the true path, addressing ailments of the five organs and the consumption of muscles and bones. Your lack of clarity and discrimination means that the scholars of the world have exhausted their learning.&quot;<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Composure</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor was seated, and he summoned Lord Lei to ask him: &quot;You, who have received teachings and recited texts, if you can survey and understand various studies, and classify and integrate principles to enlighten me, what then do you have to say about the internal organs—the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys; the gallbladder and intestines; the brain, marrow, tears, and saliva; the crying and sorrow, and the source of water&#39;s flow—these are all part of human existence, governing their ailments and mistakes. You should strive to clarify these matters; this knowledge could lead to completeness. If you cannot, then you will be resented by the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Lord Lei replied: &quot;I will recite the numerous chapters of the &#39;Pulse Classic,&#39; both upper and lower. There are different categories; yet I still cannot achieve completeness, so how can I clarify?&quot;</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;What you are capable of treating, your knowledge is already extensive, even if it is flawed. It is akin to a swan flying, also soaring into the sky. The way of sages in treating illness follows the laws and measures, makes comparisons and classifications, transforming what is obscure, following from the top to the bottom; must one necessarily adhere to the texts?&quot;<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br><strong>On the Five Excesses</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;Ah, it is far! It is like gazing into a deep abyss, or welcoming floating clouds. While the deep abyss can still be measured, the floating clouds have no known boundaries. The sage’s way serves as a standard for all people. When discussing intents and aspirations, there must be principles. Following the texts and adhering to the numbers, in accordance with medical matters, guides the people well. There are five excesses and four virtues, do you know of them? The Thunder Lord, bowing twice, said: &#39;I am young and inexperienced, foolish and confused, not aware of the five excesses and four virtues, their classifications and names, drawing only on vague texts, and my heart has no response.&#39; The Emperor said: &#39;For everyone who has not diagnosed the illness, one must first ask whether one has gone from noble to humble; even if not possessed by evil, the illness arises from within, termed as loss of essence. When the five energies linger, illnesses may converge; the physician diagnoses it, but it is not in the organs, nor does it change the bodily form; if doubt arises, the name of the illness is unknown.&#39;&quot;<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br>The body daily weakens, the vital energy is depleted and lacks essence, deep-rooted illnesses leave one breathless, leading to occasional fright. In deep sickness, one loses externally from defense and internally from nourishment. A skilled practitioner might misjudge without understanding the illness. This is also a mistake in treatment.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to diagnose an illness must inquire about diet, living conditions, sudden pleasure, and sudden sorrow; joyous beginnings followed by sorrow harm the vital energy. When essence is exhausted, the body is ruined. Sudden anger injures Yin, sudden joy injures Yang. When the vital energy rises, the meridians lose their form. A foolish doctor treats without discerning whether to tonify or drain, oblivious to the condition of the illness; essence and vitality are daily lost, while pathogenic energies intertwine. This is a second mistake in treatment.</p>
<p>A skilled pulse reader must compare, categorize, and understand steadily. A practitioner who doesn’t know yet wishes to excel is not worthy of respect in diagnosis. This is a third mistake in treatment.</p>
<p>Diagnosis has three constants, requiring inquiry into wealth and poverty, noble injuries, and the desires of kings and lords.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br>Therefore, valuing the release from power, though one is not involved in evil, if the spirit is internally wounded, the body must perish. Being wealthy initially and then becoming poor, though not due to evil, leads to skin burning and sinews bending, resulting in weakness and contractions. If a physician cannot be strict and cannot engage the spirit, being externally weak and disordered will lead to the loss of normalcy; if the condition cannot change, then medical affairs will not succeed. This is one of the four missteps in treatment.</p>
<p>In all diagnoses, one must know the beginning and the end. Understanding the remaining traces, taking pulses and asking names, one must align with male and female. Separation and blockage, worry, fear, joy, and anger lead to the emptiness of the five organs and the departure of blood and qi. If the skilled cannot understand, then what technique can they speak of? Experiences of wealth that lead to great injuries cut sinews and sever pulses; if the body recovers, it causes unremitting harm, leading to the failure of vital connections, leaving insufficient return of yang, causing accumulation of pus and cold. If a novice treats it, hastily needling yin and yang, the body will disintegrate, limbs will cramp, and death will be certain. If the physician cannot be clear, does not inquire about the cause, and only speaks of the day of death, this is also a sign of a novice. This is the fifth misstep in treatment.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br>All five of these are due to a lack of understanding of the techniques and the matters of humanity. Therefore, it is said: When a sage treats illness, they must comprehend the principles of heaven and earth, the yin and yang, the seasonal changes, the functions of the five organs and six intestines, as well as the relationship between male and female. They must know the methods of needling, moxibustion, stones, and the principles of poisons. They should approach human affairs calmly, to clarify the canonical way. Rich and poor, high and low, each has its own patterns and principles. By inquiring into the reasons for youth and age, courage and fear, one must examine the divisions to understand the origins of illness. In discerning the eight regular and nine irregular conditions, the diagnosis must be accurate.</p>
<p>The way to treat illness considers inner energy as a treasure. By seeking its principles, if one cannot find them, the problem lies in the external and internal. By adhering to data in treatment, one should not deviate from the principles of healing. Those who can apply this technique throughout their lives will remain safe. If one does not understand the principles, the five organs may become heated, leading to sores in the six intestines; misdiagnosing the illness indicates a failure to maintain normalcy. Careful adherence to this method, in conjunction with the classics, aligns upper and lower texts and assesses yin and yang. By discerning the exceptional and the constant within the five elements, one can make decisions in a clear manner. Observing beginnings and endings allows for the ability to navigate freely.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on the Four Losses</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor was in the Bright Hall, and Thunder Lord was in attendance. The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;The teachings you have received are numerous, please speak about the meanings of gains and losses. What leads to gain? What leads to loss?&quot; Thunder Lord replied: &quot;Following the classics and receiving teachings, all speak of complete fulfillment. If there are mistakes at that time, I would like to hear their explanations.&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;You are young, and your wisdom may not yet be sufficient! Are you going to mix things together? The twelve primary channels and the three hundred sixty-five collateral channels are all well known and practiced by skilled practitioners. The reasons for not achieving completeness are due to undivided spirit, unregulated will, and discrepancies between the external and internal, thus leading to doubts and dangers at times. Not understanding the principles of yin and yang, the reversals and followings, is one mistake in treatment. Not completing the training under the teacher and recklessly practicing mixed techniques, misleading others with false statements, changing names for personal gain, misusing filiform needles ultimately brings personal blame. This is the second mistake in treatment.&quot;<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br>It is inappropriate to be concerned about the dwelling of the rich or poor, the thickness or thinness of seating, the warmth or coldness of form, and to be indifferent to the suitability of food and drink, the bravery or cowardice of others, and not to recognize comparison and classification, which leads to confusion and lacks clarity. This reflects three failures in practice.</p>
<p>In diagnosing ailments, one should not neglect to inquire about their origins, the troubles arising from failures in diet, and the excesses in daily living, which may result in harm from toxins. If one does not address these issues first, but merely takes the pulse, how can any disease be correctly identified? Speaking recklessly and being constrained by trivial concerns also represents a failure in practice.</p>
<p>Thus, when people in the world speak, they may leap thousands of miles away, lacking clarity in discussion and failing to diagnose human matters correctly. The principles of healing rely on calmness and preservation.</p>
<p>Holding the pulse, if one does not discern the five pulses, the onset of various diseases will be blamed on self-reproach, leaving the teacher to bear the blame. Therefore, practice cannot adhere to reason and abandons techniques in the marketplace. Treating conditions whimsically may sometimes bring relief, but it is born out of foolishness. Alas! In the depths of obscurity, who knows the path! The great way aligns with heaven and earth, corresponding to the four seas. You do not understand the way&#39;s directives, calling clarity obscure.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br><strong>On the Rise and Fall</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: Diagnosis has ten degrees, including measuring the pulse, assessing the organs, evaluating the flesh, examining the tendons, and discerning the points. When the essence of yin and yang is exhausted, illness manifests naturally. The pulse is irregular, and yin disperses while yang prevails. When the pulse is faint and lacking, the diagnosis is inconsistent. Diagnosis must encompass both the upper and lower states, considering the people, the ruler, and the ministers. If one does not receive teaching completely, one’s skills remain unclear. Failing to discern what is contrary or in agreement leads to erroneous actions. Holding onto the feminine while losing the masculine, favoring yin over yang without understanding their union, results in unclear diagnoses. The teachings must be transmitted to future generations, reflecting upon themselves. When yin is extremely deficient, the heavenly qi is severed; when yang is overly abundant, the earthly qi is insufficient. </p>
<p>The synchrony of yin and yang is where the wise person acts. In this synchrony, yang qi arrives first, followed by yin qi. Therefore, the sage upholds the way of diagnosis by prioritizing the sequence of yin and yang. The dynamic of the extraordinary and the ordinary culminates in sixty beginnings. The subtle matters of diagnosis align with the changes in yin and yang, reflecting the emotions contained within five principles, examining the essence of emptiness and fullness, and establishing the required degrees—this is sufficient for diagnosis. Thus, if one cannot palpate the yin, the yang diagnosis will wither away.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br>Without the sun, there is no shadow; to maintain learning without depth leads to confusion. One may know the left but not the right, or know the right but not the left; one may know the top but not the bottom, or know the beginning but not the end—therefore, governance does not last long. One knows the ugly and the good, knows sickness and health, knows high and low, knows sitting and standing, knows action and stillness; using these with regulation, one grasps the Way completely, thus avoiding peril for eternity. </p>
<p>One arises with reserves and knows one’s deficiencies. In addressing matters, one understands the upper and lower, the pulse and its conditions; hence, if the body is weak and energy is deficient, death follows. If the body has excess but energy is lacking, life ceases. </p>
<p>Thus, diagnosis has standard principles, sitting and standing have their constants. There are established ways of entering and exiting, focusing the spirit keenly. One must be clear and tranquil, observing above and below, managing the eight right and wrongs, distinguishing the five central categories, feeling the pulse’s movement and stillness, following the fluctuations of cold and heat, considering its size, matching it with possible ailments, discerning whether to go against or follow, and then further identifying the names of maladies—all this makes diagnosis complete and avoids losing a sense of humanity. </p>
<p>Thus, in diagnosis, one observes breath and intention without losing coherence. The Way is clear and discerning, allowing longevity. Not understanding this Way leads to losing the foundation and severing logic. Speaking recklessly and setting baseless expectations is known as losing the Way.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br>The Yellow Emperor was in the Ming Hall when Lei Gong asked, &quot;I have received teachings about applying the principles from classic texts, instructing on the theories of yin and yang, acupuncture, moxibustion, and medicinal substances. In practice, there are the wise and the unwise, and one cannot always achieve perfection. If one first speaks of sorrow, joy, anger, and fear, of dryness, dampness, cold, and heat, as well as the distinctions of yin and yang among men and women, I seek to understand the underlying reasons for these matters. Regarding the statuses of lowly or wealthy, the forms of people, and their relationships with the world, one must carefully heed the commands. I have humble and foolish inquiries not covered in the classics, and I wish to know their nature.&quot; The Emperor replied, &quot;This is profound!&quot;</p>
<p>The Classic of the Spiritual Axis</p>
<p>On the Pathologies of Evil Qi in the Organs</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo, &quot;I have heard that by observing color, one can know a disease, which is called ‘ming’ (brightness); by feeling the pulse, one knows the disease, which is called ‘shen’ (spirit); by inquiring about the illness, one knows its location, which is termed ‘gong’ (work). I wish to learn how to see it, understand it, feel it, and inquire thoroughly about it. What should I do?&quot; Qi Bo responded, &quot;Color and pulse correspond to each other as do the resonance of a drum and a stick; they cannot be separated. This also pertains to the root and leaves: when the root dies, the leaves wither. The relationship between color, pulse, and flesh cannot be separated. Therefore, understanding one indicates mastery of work (gong), understanding two indicates spirit (shen), and understanding three indicates both spirit and brightness. Thus, those adept in feeling the pulse do not rely on color; those skilled in assessing color do not depend on the pulse. Those who can integrate and apply these can be considered top practitioners, achieving ten out of ten nine times. Those who apply two qualify as intermediate practitioners, achieving ten out of ten seven times. Those who apply one qualify as lower practitioners, achieving ten out of ten six times.&quot;<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br><strong>Root and Junction</strong></p>
<p>The essence of using acupuncture lies in understanding the balance of yin and yang. When yin and yang are harmonized, the vital energy can shine forth. Integrating spirit and energy allows the spirit to be contained within. Therefore, it is said that the skilled practitioner regulates the energy, the intermediate practitioner causes disharmony in the pulse, and the unskilled practitioner brings danger to life. Thus, it is stated that the unskilled practitioner must proceed with caution. One must carefully examine the changes in the five organs’ illnesses, the responses of the five pulses, the realities and insufficiencies of the meridians, and the softness and brittleness of the skin before taking action.</p>
<p><strong>Official Acupuncture</strong></p>
<p>Those who practice acupuncture must understand the effects of age, the fluctuations of qi, and the origins of deficiency and excess, or they cannot be considered skilled practitioners.</p>
<p><strong>Reversal and Order of Thickness and Thinness</strong></p>
<p>Qi Bo said: The way of the sage corresponds above with heaven, below with earth, and in the middle with human affairs. There must be clear principles to formulate measures. The methods of regulation and precision can later be transmitted. Thus, a craftsman cannot abandon the measurements and mistakenly envision lengths or depths, nor ignore the tools and create level waters. A worker cannot ignore the compass to create a circle, nor discard the square to create a rectangle. Understanding and applying these principles is crucial for natural phenomena and the normalcy of reversal and order.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br><strong>On Harmonizing Qi across the Four Seasons</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: If there are variations in the times, what could be the reason? Qi Bo replied: It is due to the failure to harmonize with the seasonal qi; when an organ is solely affected by disease, it must be due to the qi of that organ being weak against the seasonal influence, while its stronger seasonal counterparts arise. The Yellow Emperor asked: How should one treat this? Qi Bo replied: By aligning with the timing of nature, one can effectively address the illness. To be in harmony is to be skilled; to act against it is to be crude.</p>
<p><strong>On Deviant Winds</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: What is the reason for those who simply chant a blessing? Qi Bo replied: The ancient shamans understood the victories of various ailments and were aware of the origins of those illnesses, thus they could merely chant blessings.</p>
<p><strong>On the Twelve Difficulties</strong></p>
<p>The scriptures state: When the pulses of the five organs are exhausted internally, needling should be directed externally; when the pulses of the five organs are exhausted externally, needling should turn inward. How does one distinguish between the internal and external failures? Indeed, when the pulses in the five organs are exhausted internally, it also signifies the exhaustion of the kidney and liver pulses; yet, the physician mistakenly reinforces the heart and lungs. Conversely, when the pulses of the five organs are exhausted externally, the heart and lung pulses are similarly depleted; however, the physician wrongly reinforces the kidneys and liver. Complementing yang when yin is depleted, and complementing yin when yang is depleted—this is termed reality and illusion, diminishing the insufficient and augmenting the excessive. In such cases, the physician is essentially responsible for the patient’s demise.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br>Thirteen Difficulties</p>
<p>The classic text states that when one sees the complexion but cannot detect the pulse, if one finds a pulse that is victorious over another, it signifies death; if one finds a pulse that nurtures another, the illness will resolve itself. The colors and pulses should correspond; but how should this be done? Indeed. Each of the five organs has five colors, which can all be observed on the face, and they should also correspond with the pulse at the wrist. For example, if the color is blue, the pulse should be taut and quick; if red, the pulse should be floating, large, and scattered; if yellow, the pulse should be moderate and large; if white, the pulse should be floating, thin, and short; if black, the pulse should be deep, moist, and slippery. This illustrates how the five colors correspond with the five pulses. If the pulse is rapid, then the skin at the wrist is also rapid; if the pulse is quick, the skin is also quick; if the pulse is slow, the skin is also slow; if the pulse is thin, the skin is also thin; if the pulse is slippery, the skin is also slippery. Each organ has its own sound, color, smell, and taste, which should correspond with the pulse at the wrist; failure to correspond indicates illness. For instance, if the color is blue, and the pulse is floating, thin, and short, it would indicate a victory if it is large and slow; floating and large, and small and slippery would indicate nurturing. The classic states that knowing one signifies being a lesser practitioner, knowing two represents a mid-level practitioner, and knowing three signifies a superior practitioner. The superior practitioner achieves perfection nine times out of ten, the mid-level practitioner achieves eight out of ten, and the lesser practitioner achieves six out of ten. This is what it refers to.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br>The 61st Difficulty</p>
<p>The classics state that to know by observation is called divine, to know by hearing is called sage, to know by inquiry is called skillful, and to know by pulse examination is called artful. What does this mean? Indeed. To know by observation means to see the five colors to understand the illness; to know by hearing means to listen to the five sounds to differentiate the sickness; to know by inquiry means to ask about their desired five flavors to understand the source of the illness; to know by pulse examination means to diagnose by checking the wrist, looking at its fullness and emptiness to understand which organ the illness resides in. Knowledge derived from external means is called sage, while knowledge derived from internal means is called divine. This is what is meant.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a></p>
<h3>Chapter 77</h3>
<p>The classics say, &quot;The superior healer addresses the disease before it manifests; the intermediate healer treats the disease once it appears.&quot; What does this mean? Indeed, treating a disease before it manifests refers to recognizing the illness of the liver, which is known to affect the spleen. Thus, one first strengthens the spleen&#39;s qi to prevent the invasion of the liver’s pathogenic influence, hence it is said to treat before the disease. The intermediate healer, however, sees the liver illness and focuses solely on the liver without understanding the connections, thus it is said to treat the disease after it manifests.</p>
<h3>Chapter 81</h3>
<p>The classics say, &quot;There is both reality and illusion; one drains what is insufficient while benefiting what is excessive—this is the pulse at the wrist. Is the nature of the disease related to these realities and illusions? How should one balance the depletion and the excess?&quot; Indeed, it is not the pulse at the wrist that signifies illness; it indicates that the disease itself has realities and illusions. For instance, if the liver is full and the lung is deficient, where the liver represents wood and the lung represents metal, wood and metal should balance each other. One must know to balance metal with wood. Conversely, if the lung is full and the liver is deficient, and there’s little qi, one should not supplement the liver with needles, but rather focus on reducing the excessive lung condition. Thus, it is said there is reality and illusion; depleting what is insufficient while benefiting what is excessive. This is detrimental to the intermediate healer. </p>

<p><strong>On the order of diseases related to viscera, bowels, meridians, and pulse diagnostics.</strong><a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br><strong>Question:</strong> What does it mean to treat diseases before they occur? </p>
<p><strong>Master:</strong> To treat diseases before they occur means to recognize the illness of the liver and understand how it affects the spleen; therefore, one should first strengthen the spleen. If the spleen, the ruler of the four seasons, does not suffer from evil influences, then it should not be supplemented. An intermediate practitioner, lacking this understanding, will see liver illness but will only treat the liver without resolving the spleen.</p>
<p><strong>Path to Eliminate Illness:</strong> </p>
<p>The method to eliminate illness focuses on observing symptoms, inquiring about preferences, examining the causes of disease, and considering the common ailments of the time; thus, one can trace the course of an illness from beginning to end. Once the disease is understood, treat external diseases internally and address upper issues to rescue lower issues. Differentiate between the deficiency and excess of organ diseases, recognize the relationships between mother and child organs, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and tailor the prescriptions accordingly, leading to a superior practitioner’s expertise. The best prescriptions use single flavors, two flavors come second, and multiple flavors rank lowest. Sour flavors enter the bones, sweet flavors resolve toxins, bitter flavors eliminate heat, salty flavors guide downward, and spicy flavors disperse stagnation. One should test the medicine; if it has not been tested, be cautious about hasty use. Once the major condition has passed, residual symptoms should not be treated again with medicine. Those who are well-nourished should receive ample doses, while the frail and weak should have reduced doses. </p>
<p>Using medicine is like waging war, and utilizing a physician is like employing a general. A good military leader may not rely solely on war chariots; a proficient herbalist shows the effectiveness of ginger and cassia. Knowing a person&#39;s abilities to assign them to a task represents the way of employing generals; knowing the techniques to prescribe denotes the way of employing physicians. In the world, there are no difficult-to-treat diseases, only poorly skilled physicians; there are no irreplaceable medicines, only inadequately skilled individuals who misprescribe. Among the common people, certain deaths can be recognized.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br><strong>Examination of the Subtle</strong></p>
<p>Illness can mistakenly be perceived as coolness and then result in true coldness; there can also be phenomena that appear to be true but are actually false. A small deviation can lead to significant loss of life. The &quot;Floating Chest Sutra&quot; in the chapter on the two energies states: All diarrhea is due to heat, and all coolness relates to regulation. Heat first affects the inner organs, while cold first influences the blood&#39;s warmth. In the chapter on abdominal ailments, it states: Dry pain should at times be considered as caused by worms, and residual stabbing pain often leads to swelling. The chapter on cold damage indicates: Wind patterns and epidemics, damp heat and lingering phlegm, cause malaria and rashes, all similar to cold damage. When malaria is common, one should take precautions against it; when rashes are common, one should be wary of catching them. Spring plagues and summer epidemics first reveal internal symptoms. For dampness and heat, it is advisable to test with certain herbs like Lingzhi and Atractylodes. When administering dispersing agents, both vomiting and sweating must occur; such symptoms indicate lingering phlegm and, if not guided properly, may lead to limb dysfunction. Alas! Some illnesses are subtle yet deadly, while conditions that seem severe are easily treated. The precision of subtle differentiation is the hallmark of great practitioners in the world!<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br><strong>Distinguishing Books</strong></p>
<p>Yin Yancheng asked: In today&#39;s world, is there a way to engage with the works of ancient masters? The response was: A good teacher and friend, a skilled physician, learn through words and recognize changes; they review old texts, using nets to seek fish. With extensive knowledge of diseases, multiple diagnoses, and repeated use of effective medicines, what shame is there in being compared to ancient people!</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Medicine</strong></p>
<p>A physician cannot be entrusted to one who is not benevolent, wise, and discerning. They must also be honest and genuinely good. Therefore, in ancient times, those who practiced medicine were carefully chosen from well-known families, possessing virtue and the ability to be compassionate and loving. They had to be intelligent and articulate, capable of understanding the celestial and spiritual realms, discerning the factors of life and death, distinguishing between vacuity and actuality, determining the rules of oppositions and agreements, evaluating the severity of ailments, and adjusting medicine&#39;s dosage accordingly, paying attention to the subtle and the profound, without neglecting the minute details. Thus, they are called good doctors. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Daoists value coolness, using plants that grow in cold; meanwhile, doctors advocate warmth, facilitating the flow of blood and channels. It is not enough to grasp the general principles; one must understand the finer details, including the balance of hardness and softness, the nuances of seasonal changes, and the regulations of intake and excretion. Renowned physicians examine the pulse at the three positions of the wrist, which reveals the truth. They measure the seasonal changes and assess warmth and cold, observing the pulse dynamics and aligning weight with lightness, proportioning medicine and minerals accordingly. This can be called a renowned physician. There are those who are well-known yet ineffective, and others who remain obscure yet are proficient. Those in authority who employ physicians must thoroughly evaluate and discern their qualifications.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br>The Book of Sui</p>
<p>The Treatise on Classics</p>
<p>Medical prescriptions are techniques used to remove illnesses and preserve life. The heavens have the dualities of yin and yang, the elements of wind and rain, and cycles of light and darkness; humans experience emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow, love, and hatred. By regulating these emotions, one achieves harmony and balance, whereas indulging exclusively leads to deterioration and illness. Thus, the sage understands the essence of blood vessels, using needles and stones, employing medicinal substances, regulating the internal balance, nurturing energy, unblocking stagnation, and alleviating constrictions, thus returning to a state of simplicity. Those skilled in this can understand governance through pulse diagnosis and relate illnesses to the state. The physician&#39;s role, as detailed in the Zhou rituals, involves gathering various medicines to treat all who are ill; this is their duty. If the unworthy engage in this, they undermine the fundamental nature. Therefore, it is said that those with illnesses who do not seek treatment will invariably rely on traditional medicine.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br><strong>On the Practice of Great Physicians</strong> </p>
<p>If one wishes to become a great physician, one must be well-versed in the &quot;Su Wen,&quot; &quot;Jia Yi,&quot; &quot;Huang Di&#39;s Canon of Acupuncture,&quot; &quot;Mingtang Liu Zhu,&quot; the twelve meridians, the three departments and nine conditions, the five organs and six bowels, the exterior and interior points, the herbal remedies of &quot;Ben Cao,&quot; and the classical formulas of Zhang Zhongjing, Wang Shuhe, Yuan Henan, Fan Dongyang, Zhang Miao, Jin Shao, and others. Moreover, one must deeply understand the theories of yin and yang, the principles of fate, the observations of the tortoise&#39;s five signs, the &quot;I Ching,&quot; and the art of the six ren. Mastery of these is essential to becoming a great physician. </p>
<p>Without such understanding, it would be akin to wandering blind at night, leading to danger and demise. Next, one should thoroughly read these formulas, contemplate their profound meanings, and dedicate oneself to research; only then can one engage in the medical field. Additionally, one must explore various books. Why, you ask? If one does not read the Five Classics, one will not know the principles of benevolence and righteousness; if one does not read the Three Histories, one will not know the affairs of past and present; if one does not read the various schools of thought, one will not be able to silently recognize them; if one does not read the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; one will not know the virtues of compassion, joy, and charity; if one does not study Zhuangzi and Laozi, one cannot adequately navigate the universal principles, thus becoming hindered by fortune and misfortune. As for the Five Elements and the Seven Luminaries in astronomy, one must also engage with these; if one can comprehensively study them, then in the medical field, one will experience no obstacles and attain excellence.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br><strong>On the Great Physician&#39;s Precision and Sincerity</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Zhan said: The difficulty in mastering the classic formulas has existed for a long time. Today, diseases can have similar internal characteristics but different external manifestations, and vice versa. Therefore, the fullness and emptiness of the five organs and six bowels, as well as the circulation and obstruction of blood and qi, cannot be discerned merely by sight and hearing; they must first be diagnosed and examined. The pulse at the inch and the cun can show various irregularities such as floating, sinking, tightness, and slackness. The acupoints can have differences in elevation and depth, while the skin, muscles, and bones may vary in thickness and softness. Only those who are meticulous and discerning can truly understand these matters.</p>
<p>To seek the most refined and subtle knowledge through coarse and superficial thinking is perilous! If one adds to what is already full, depletes what is empty, aggravates what is open, and obstructs what is blocked, if one cools what is cold and warms what is hot, this only exacerbates the illness while hoping for recovery; I have seen such patients perish. Therefore, the art of medicine and divination is challenging to perfect. If it were not divinely inspired, how could one grasp the profound and subtle? In this world, there are fools who, after studying formulas for three years, claim there are no diseases that can be treated, and after three years of treating diseases, come to realize that there are no formulas that can be universally applied.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br>Therefore, scholars must extensively explore the sources of medicine, diligently and tirelessly, avoiding hearsay while claiming to have grasped the medical path. This is truly lamentable! Any great physician treating illness must first calm the mind and settle the will, free from desires and aspirations. They should cultivate profound compassion and a heart of pity, vowing to universally relieve the suffering of all sentient beings. When someone in distress comes seeking help, they must not inquire about wealth or poverty, status or age, beauty or ugliness, familial ties or friendships, whether they are of the nobility or the common folk; they should regard everyone as equals, akin to one&#39;s closest kin. Furthermore, they must not look forward or backward, worrying about fortune and misfortune, nor should they be concerned about their own safety. Witnessing others in pain, one should feel as if it were their own suffering, experiencing deep sorrow: One must not avoid hardship, whether day or night, through cold and heat, hunger and thirst, or fatigue, but must wholeheartedly rush to assist, without the intention of seeking recognition or reputation. In this way, one can truly be a great physician for the people; if one deviates from this, they are akin to a great thief of sentience. Throughout history, esteemed figures have treated illnesses, often risking their lives to aid those in dire straits. Although one may claim to value human life over that of animals, in the face of danger, life is ultimately one and the same. To benefit oneself at the expense of others is a shared suffering of all beings; how much more should this apply to humans? Killing for the sake of survival only distances one further from life. The reason why I do not use life as medicine today is precisely because of this understanding.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br>Among the creatures like leeches and pests, if there are those that have died beforehand available in the market, they may be used, as this does not violate the principle. For instance, in the case of chicken eggs, since they are still not fully formed, there is undoubtedly a critical need, and one may reluctantly use them; those who can refrain from using them are truly wise, a level beyond reach. When faced with ailments such as sores or dysentery, which are foul and unbearable to look at—things that are detestable to others—the reaction should be shame and compassion, without the slightest thought of personal gain; this is my aspiration. </p>
<p>For a great physician, one must achieve a tranquil mind, able to introspect, and look upon the situation with a serene demeanor, expansive and free, not shining bright nor drearily dim, thoroughly inspecting symptoms and illnesses, with deep intention and careful observation, missing no detail. In administering treatment, one must not be haphazard. While it is said that ailments should be quickly addressed, one must not be confused in the process. It is essential to examine the situation carefully and reflect deeply, without hastily seeking reputation at the expense of life, for that would be lacking in benevolence. Additionally, when visiting a patient’s home, regardless of the lavish decor one should not look around indiscriminately; even if musical instruments play nearby, one must not appear entertained; even if delicacies are offered, the food should taste bland; fine wines served should seem as if they were nonexistent.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br>Thus it is, when one person is in distress, the whole place is filled with sorrow. How much more so is the pain of the sick, who cannot be separated from their suffering, while a physician remains carefree and proud, indulging in joy. This is a shared shame among humans and gods, something that the truly wise would never do—this is the essence of the healer&#39;s intention. </p>
<p>As for the practice of medicine, one must not speak too much, jest, chatter, argue about right and wrong, discuss people, flaunt one’s fame, disparage other doctors, or boast of one&#39;s own virtue. If by chance one cures a disease, one should not hold one’s head high with an air of superiority, believing oneself to be unparalleled. This is the foolishness of physicians. </p>
<p>Laozi said: &quot;Those who act with virtue in the open are rewarded by heaven; those who act with virtue in secret are harmed by spirits.&quot; Following these two paths, the responses of yin and yang are surely not misleading. Therefore, a physician must not rely on their own strengths or focus solely on material gain, but instead cultivate a heart for alleviating suffering, and in the depths of their path, they will naturally feel abundant blessings.</p>
<p>Moreover, one should not treat the wealthy with rare and precious medicines, making it difficult for the poor to obtain them. Flaunting one’s skills is certainly not the way of loyalty and compassion. The intention to provide relief should be at the forefront, hence one must be flexible and considerate in discussions. Scholars should not be ashamed to express humble words!<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></p>
<h3>Discussion on Treatment of Illness: Brief Example</h3>
<p>Heaven distributes the five elements to sustain all beings; humanity embodies the five constants to form the five organs. The channels and collaterals, yin and yang, interconnect; the original, the obscure, and the subtle are ever-changing and difficult to grasp. The Book of Changes states: &quot;If it is not the utmost mystery of the world, who can engage with it?&quot; Observing today&#39;s physicians, they do not contemplate and seek the essence of the classics to expand their understanding. Rather, each follows their traditional skills, clinging to old methods from beginning to end. When diagnosing illnesses or asking about symptoms, they focus on verbal responses, relying only on brief interactions. They apply remedies without thorough examination, taking superficial measurements that do not capture the whole condition; they check the pulse without understanding its depth, dismiss the body&#39;s currents, and disregard important signs. Often, they do not reach fifty proper assessments, and are unaware of crucial diagnoses, lacking a comprehensive view, merely peering through a tube. The challenge of distinguishing life from death is indeed difficult. Should not patients be vigilant about recognizing these shortcomings in their physicians to guard against negligence? Throughout history, physicians have harbored jealousy and malice towards one another; the case of Bian Que, who was harmed by Li Shizhen, the chief physician of the Qin dynasty, exemplifies this. When one physician prescribes, they must not allow another physician to collaborate improperly, risking the addition of harmful substances that would exacerbate the illness, leading to suffering. Such instances are not uncommon; hence, caution is essential.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br>It is better to not take medicine and accept the natural order than to have foolish doctors compete, endangering lives—this is indeed tragic. Diagnosing patients is not easy; knowing the conditions through inquiry distinguishes the skilled doctors. Zhang Zhongjing said: &quot;Anyone wishing to harmonize decoctions, herbs, and acupuncture techniques must engage in deep thought. One must understand the twelve meridians, identify the three hundred sixty-five acupoints, recognize the flow of vital energy, and discern the location of diseases—the methods of treatment must be understood.&quot; In ancient times, the highest physicians observed colors. The colors, pulses, and forms must not be disconnected. When black dominates red, it leads to death; when red dominates blue, it leads to life. Chinese medicine considers sounds, correlating them to the five tones. Fire perceives water’s sound, leading to anxiety and fright; wood perceives metal’s sound, leading to fear of punishment. The spleen represents earth; it nurtures all things, supports all around. In favorable conditions, it is unseen; in death, it reverts to it. Excessive activation leads to immobility of limbs, while deficiency leads to blocked orifices and closed senses, akin to a person inebriated. The four seasons circulate, ending and beginning anew. Lower physicians diagnose pulses and understand disease origins, observing the flows and shifts through the seasons, knowing their interrelations—this is the essence of mastery.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br><strong>On Diagnosing Illness</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, those skilled in medicine were categorized as follows: the highest physicians treat the state, the middle physicians treat the people, and the lowest physicians treat diseases. Furthermore, it is said that the highest physicians listen to sounds, the middle physicians observe colors, and the lowest physicians diagnose pulses. Additionally, the highest physicians treat diseases that have yet to emerge, the middle physicians treat diseases that are desired to emerge, and the lowest physicians treat diseases that are already present. If one does not carefully apply themselves and allow confusion to arise, it becomes difficult to save the patient. </p>
<p>Foolish physicians do not understand the three divisions, nine pulses, and the principles of the four seasons. They may incorrectly use decoctions or medicines and misapply acupuncture, leading to more ailments, resulting in their demise. Alas, the masses suffer, and half die unjustly; it can be said that there are no good physicians in the world. These practitioners fail to explain the classics regarding the interplay of earth, water, fire, and wind, which together create human life. However, foolish physicians do not consider the pulse pathways and incorrectly treat ailments, causing the internal organs and their five elements to conflict with one another, like pouring oil on a raging fire—this cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>In all matters, the four Qi must harmonize, and the four spirits must be at peace. If one Qi is out of balance, a hundred diseases arise; if the four spirits are disturbed, four hundred and four diseases emerge simultaneously. It is also said: one hundred diseases may heal on their own without treatment; one hundred diseases require treatment to heal; one hundred diseases may be difficult to cure even with treatment; one hundred diseases will lead to true death if untreated.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br><strong>Notes from Dongpo</strong> by Su Shi (Song Dynasty)</p>
<p>Regarding seeking medical treatment and pulse diagnosis</p>
<p>The difficulty in reading pulses has been a longstanding issue through the ages. When the pulse is thin yet has substantial indicators, and when it shows strong signs but is frail, even a slight difference can make the distinction between life and death, fortune and misfortune. This has been a problem throughout history. One cannot avoid consulting a physician, yet truly skilled practitioners are very few. Exceptional horses are rare indeed, as the world has never seen one that did not need to be ridden; likewise, outstanding physicians do not appear often, and patients do not die in vain, as it is due to their strengths that they guard against their weaknesses. Many local doctors hold secret knowledge of the ailments and seek consultations to test the abilities of the physicians, thereby making the diagnosis a wandering search through uncertainty, distinguishing the real from the false amidst suspicion. If the physician unfortunately fails, they still do not acknowledge their failure, resorting to clever embellishments to preserve their reputation; yet, if no recovery is achieved, they say it was indeed difficult to treat. Occasionally, some are diligent and wish to improve, but even if they refer to the words of the patient, they still mix in their own observations, balancing both, leading to ineffective remedies; this is a universal problem of our time that remains unrecognized. Throughout my life, when I sought medical help, I generally observed their skill or lack thereof during normal times. When I did fall ill and sought treatment, I would first fully disclose my ailments, then request a diagnosis. By letting the physician clearly understand the source of the problem first, the matters of deficiency and excess, heat and cold, would be determined beforehand, hence the doubts of the pulse could not confuse. Therefore, even with traditional medicine, my ailments always improved. My only goal was to recover from my illness; I did not seek to trouble the physician.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br>The physician prescribes medicine based on intention.</p>
<p>Ouyang Wenzhong once remarked that a patient, when asked about the cause of his illness, said: &quot;I was on a boat and encountered strong winds, which startled me and led to my condition.&quot; The physician then used a long-standing remedy: he took a tooth from a long-standing tree, cut it where it was moist with sweat from the boatman’s hands, mixed it with cinnabar and substances like Poria, and the patient recovered after drinking it. Now, according to the &quot;Pharmaceutical Notes,&quot; citing the &quot;Discussion on Medicinal Properties,&quot; it states that to stop sweating, one should take the root of Ephedra and grind it with ancient bamboo leaves to consume. Wenzhong noted that physicians often rely heavily on cooking and using medicines in this manner. Initially, it seemed trivial like child’s play; however, it sometimes proved effective, though it is difficult to challenge that assertion. I then said: &quot;If you nourish scholars with ink and burnt ash, should they not be cured of laziness? Broadening this perspective, one could say that drinking the washing water of Boyi can cure greed, eating the remnants of Bigan&#39;s dish can end flattery, licking the shield of Fan Kuai can heal cowardice, and touching the earrings of Xi Shi can alleviate wickedness.&quot; He then laughed heartily. On the seventeenth day of the eighth month in the third year of the Yuanyou era, while sailing into the boundary of Yingzhou, I sat and recalled twenty years ago when I saw Wenzhong here, and casually recorded this moment of conversation and laughter.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br><strong>Record of Escaping the Heat</strong><br><strong>(Song Dynasty, Ye Mengde)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scholar-Official Should Not Trust Physicians Lightly</strong></p>
<p>In matters of the world, if the scholar-official is smart and self-assured, there is nothing they cannot accomplish, yet they should not be overly reliant on physicians. In our dynasty, among the high-ranking officials, only Gao Wenzhuang can be considered adept in medicine, particularly in treating fevers. The knowledge he possesses is unknown to us. However, individuals like Sun Zhao and Du Ren have gained some recognition, which is sufficient to mark them in history. Wenzhuang is from Yungzhou, and to this day, Yung has many physicians, especially skilled in treating fevers, all stemming from the Gao lineage. During the Chongning and Daguan eras, while I was in the capital, I encountered Dong Ji, Liu Yin, and others who were well-versed in Zhang Zhongjing’s medical arts; their skills were unmatched by the conventional practitioners since the Jianghuai region. Zi Zhan, residing in Huangzhou, noted that the physician Pang Anchang from Qizhou was also adept in treating fevers and had grasped the essence of Zhongjing’s methods.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br>In Shu, there was a figure named Chao Gu who developed a medicinal powder called Sheng San Zi Fang, claiming to have learned it from a mysterious person, without prior mention in the medical texts of past eras. He asserted that it could treat any case of typhus, regardless of symptoms, and it was said to cure all ailments. Zizhan was intrigued by this and wrote a preface, comparing it to Sun Simiao’s San Jiansan, though he did not dare to criticize it too harshly. He included it in his work &quot;Shanghan Lun,&quot; and it gained widespread acceptance throughout the land.</p>
<p>However, the treatment was extremely precise; even the slightest error could lead to death in cases of typhus. If the medicine was misused, it would result in many deaths. How could one use such a remedy without regard for symptoms? After the Xuán Hé era, this medicine became popular in the capital, with students from the Taixue trusting it deeply, leading to countless fatalities. </p>
<p>Eventually, medical practitioners realized the truth and began to abandon its use. Chao Gu was originally a chivalrous person with a curiosity for the unusual, having come from Shaanxi and associated with Han Cunbao in the military, though he did not achieve success. He became a guest in Huangzhou, where Zizhan befriended him due to his adventurous spirit and sought his recipe. The world trusted Zizhan&#39;s words due to his writings. </p>
<p>The situation was fundamentally unrelated, yet those chasing fame forgot their own safety and recklessly tried the medicine; such confusion among people is truly remarkable.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br><strong>Collection of Prescriptions</strong></p>
<p>The scholar-officials should not lightly speak of medicine; however, when people are ill without serious ailments, and the poor cannot obtain medicine, if each can follow their symptoms and apply remedies, it is not without minor benefits. Although an illness may not necessarily lead to death, without medicine quick recovery is impossible. Those who moan aimlessly indeed deserve pity; their misfortune may delay recovery, and many have died from the transformation into other ailments. In urgent times, if there are means to assist, it can be said to bring one back from death. Now, in each district, every summer, a budget of two hundred thousand is allocated to supply medicine for the civilians and soldiers, as requested by Lord Han Wei when he was an advisor. Those in charge of the districts often neglect their duties, frequently letting incompetent physicians steal their salaries, or they may have medicine yet fail to reach the impoverished. When I was in Xuchang, there were indeed many illnesses annually, yet the officials neglected to uphold previous practices, with the last five years being completely forgotten, which shows their negligence.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br>He then gathered a thousand strings of cash to market herbal medicine in the capital, while I personally supervised the physicians in their treatments, arranging for attendants to provide daily distributions. I did not consider this beyond my duties, nor did I reproach them. Everyone was eager to participate; what hesitation could there be in this?</p>
<p>Since I have been residing in this mountain, I have often wished to use private funds amounting to hundreds or thousands to help a village, but I have faced the problem of lacking someone to oversee the work, and my own efforts have not been sufficient. I have sought monks or pure individuals to collaborate, yet they have not been able to fulfill my intentions.</p>
<p>This year, many of my servants fell ill, and I consistently examined the medicinal pouch for effective remedies, rigorously confirming their applications, achieving a success rate of ten out of ten. Ultimately, can I hope to extend this goodwill to the neighbors?</p>
<p>Lord Lu Xuan collected fifty ancient remedy texts in Zhongzhou. Historical accounts suggest that he refrained from writing to avoid slander, which is understandable. However, what need is there to compile remedy texts to avoid slander? Some say that Zhongzhou is near areas prone to miasma, and Lord Xuan has suffered many ailments, intending to manage his own health. This is not the case! Would Lord Xuan prioritize his own wellbeing above others’? He is indeed assisting those in suffering and in danger of death, yet he seeks to do so anonymously, where others may not recognize it; surely, if his intentions are indeed as stated.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br>In ancient times, the famous physician Bian Que employed gentle techniques that the world did not know. Since Zhang Zhongjing, Hua Tuo, Hu Qia, Shen Shi, and Xu Yanbo, those who became renowned in their time all utilized the six classic medical texts. Their teachings have been passed down to the present day through the efforts of later scholars who compiled them. Sun Zhenren authored the &quot;Thousand Gold Prescriptions&quot; in two volumes, and it is said that anyone who cultivates and nurtures life must first harmonize their efforts with Yin practices to achieve immortality. As for Sun Simiao, when he composed the front part of the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; at over a hundred years old, he had already mastered the essentials of ancient and modern prescription texts, yet he felt he hadn’t fully explored the topic of cold damage, seeming to lack a comprehensive understanding of Zhongjing’s words, so he did not dare to discuss it deeply. Thirty years later, he wrote the &quot;Thousand Gold Supplements,&quot; dedicating half of it to cold damage, indicating that he had begun to grasp it, and his meticulous commitment was evident in this work. Today, those who speak of medicine in the world regard these two books as essential guides. There is no doubt about Sun Simiao&#39;s status as an immortal.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br>Indeed, the Tang people especially remember that there are those who use insects and leeches; among all living beings, their lives are not to be elevated. If the heavens treat living things in such a cruel manner, how could they be unaware of the desire to preserve human life? What of the aspirations of Duke Xuan!</p>
<p>The ancient methods were often successful for the wealthy, but many of the poor and lowly did not experience such outcomes; conversely, the folk remedies were often effective for the poor, while the wealthy found little success. I initially doubted this but eventually realized: wealthy people typically safeguard themselves carefully; when they fall ill, their ailments must develop gradually, arising from within before manifesting outward, and cannot be entirely resolved by the ancient methods alone. </p>
<p>The poor, however, quickly acquire sickness from fluctuations in temperature, humidity, hunger, fatigue, and rest. These are not necessarily genuine illnesses, and there is no need to deeply investigate the causes; so long as there is something present, anything can be treated, while the ancient methods and strict protocols may not align with them. </p>
<p>Today, the ignorant commoners, encountering ailments without significant cause, simply rely on familiar remedies, knowing that if they have a certain illness, they should take a particular medicine, and there’s hardly anyone who does not recover after spending a hundred coins at the market. If presented with something unfamiliar, they will likely hesitate and refuse to take it. Additionally, the ancient methods of dividing decoctions and liquids are considerably different from the present ones; the herbs from different regions vary, and so do people’s innate qualities. </p>
<p>The &quot;Suwen&quot; states that there should be distinct principles for varied treatments, emphasizing that each illness requires a different approach for a cure. Based on this reasoning, even if we treat ordinary people with folk remedies, we should not completely dismiss them.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br><strong>The Jade Stream Miscellany</strong><br><strong>Song Dynasty - Ye Mengde</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Physician Cannot Revive the Dead</strong></p>
<p>Hua Tuo was indeed a divine physician, yet both Fan Ye and Chen Shou recorded that when treating illnesses, they spoke of conditions that were internally lodged and beyond the reach of needles and medicines. First, he would administer麻沸散 (a type of anesthetic) in wine, causing the patient to become drunk and unaware, after which he would cut open the abdomen and back to remove accumulations. If the issue was in the intestines or stomach, he would carefully dissect and cleanse, removing impurities, and then stitch up the wounds, applying a divine ointment. In four to five days, the wounds would heal, and within a month, the patient would be restored. This is indeed a matter of decisive action. What makes a person a person is their form, and what gives rise to that form is vital energy. The ability of certain medicines to cause a person to be oblivious to surgery and yet allow for restoration is something I cannot comprehend.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br>If the abdomen and internal organs are already ruptured and damaged, how can the vital energy be restored? Is there any possibility of regeneration in such a case? If one could do this, then all who suffer corporal punishment could be made to live again, and the punishments of kings would have no further application. </p>
<p>The historian Sima Qian, in his account of Bian Que, discusses the notion that treating illness should not rely on medicinal liquids, terrain techniques, incisions, or carving the flesh. He refers to the ancient methods of treatment, not suggesting that Bian Que possessed such arts, but rather that the world has misconstrued this. The lifespan of every person, whether long or short, cannot hinge on the skill of a single physician. It may be unfortunate for one to fall ill and escape death, yet still be harmed by incompetent doctors. There is no malady that a physician cannot address to restore life when there is potential for recovery.</p>
<p>The texts on medicine are meant to address treatable ailments and prevent harm. Bian Que himself stated that a skilled physician can aid those who are naturally destined to live, implying that they can merely help that which is meant to survive. Therefore, instead of relying on foolish doctors who thrive on dubious curiosities and untested methods, one would be better served to gain knowledge of self-care and nurture their health during a peaceful and carefree time to prolong their natural life.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br><strong>Dream Brook Talks</strong><br><strong>Song Dynasty - Shen Kuo</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Caution in Using Medicine</strong>  </p>
<p>In the art of medicine, if one does not understand it from the heart and relies solely on books, they are unlikely to attain its wonderful subtleties. For example, the herb Zhu can affect the essence of limestone; according to the theory of limestone, if one consumes limestone, they must avoid Zhu for life. The various formulas that include limestone as the main ingredient but also contain Zhu are fundamentally contradictory, and I do not understand what this means! I have asked experienced doctors, yet none could explain its significance. The theory of limestone states that although the stone pillars are warm, their substance is inherently heavy and can only become effective after being steamed and thinned out. Therefore, if one consumes a large quantity of the stone, it tends to steam itself; but if additional medicine is used to touch it, the effect will certainly be intensified. Just as a small fire must be fanned by the wind to ignite, a strong fire can be harmed by excessive fanning; this is a principle of nature. Hence, Sun Simiao stated: &quot;The five stone powder is highly toxic; it is better to eat wild kudzu than to use the five stones. When encountering this formula, one must burn it to avoid the dangers of consumption.&quot; He also said: &quot;People should not take stones; otherwise, all affairs will be unwell; with stones in the body, all things will be futile.&quot;<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br>One should not use Wushi San, as it gathers what is detrimental and when provoked can lead to violent effects. The ancient physicians had a general principle like this, which cannot be fully detailed in this book. Furthermore, prescription books often contain many forgeries and mixed content. For instance, the &quot;Shennong Bencao&quot; is one of the oldest texts, yet it contains numerous errors that physicians must be aware of. </p>
<p>I had a relative who used to take Chuanxiong; a doctor named Zheng Shuxiong saw him and said that Chuanxiong should not be taken for a long time, as it can cause sudden death. Eventually, my relative, though he had no illness, passed away. Similarly, my in-law, the wife of Zhang Zitong, took Chuanxiong for a long time due to a disease called &quot;wind in the brain,&quot; and also died unexpectedly; I witnessed both cases. </p>
<p>I once suffered from heavy loins; I would feel relaxed after sitting for a long time but could only walk after covering a distance of over ten steps. An assistant I had asked me, &quot;Could it be that you are using bitter bean for cleaning your teeth?&quot; At that time, I had used bitter bean for my dental issues for years. He said, &quot;That is the cause of your ailment.&quot; Using bitter bean on the teeth affects the kidneys and can lead to heavy loins. Later, there was a minor official named Shu Zhaoliang who also used bitter bean for his teeth. After many years, he too suffered from lumbar issues. After that, I completely stopped using bitter bean, and my back pain was cured. These are all matters not recorded in ancient prescriptions.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br><strong>On Medicine</strong></p>
<p>One without constant virtue cannot practice medicine; human life hangs in the balance of life and death. A mediocre person masquerades as a physician to deceive themselves, initially seeking great profit. Their treatments, whether adding or removing remedies, may not be appropriate. Fortunately, if the patient does not die, they will falsely claim satisfaction to fulfill their desires; if alas, the patient dies, they blame it on the indulgence in food and drink, asserting the patient disregarded prohibitions, claiming it is not the fault of the medicine. Burdened by their actions, how can the dead be innocent? In this world, there are no skilled doctors like Bian Que who can foresee life and death, nor Huatuo who can cleanse ailments.

<p><strong>On Physicians with Better Remedies</strong>  </p>
<p>Li said: I have often seen physicians in the world who possess excellent remedies but keep them secret or alter them to confuse others, which is truly contemptible. I ponder the case of Xihua Maimen Stone Gypsum, which is guarded and not passed down; such intentions are selfish, and a gentleman would be accountable for this. In the past, Zhao Gongxuan taught Ji Xiu, who came to preside over Longquan. He hurriedly advanced but suffered from a nosebleed, losing several sheng daily. At that time, his elder brother advised him to take lotus root juice and Rehmannia paste. Zhao consulted various physicians, and one said: This is a cautionary remedy. He changed doctors several times, all to no avail. His elder brother secretly provided the juice, and after three days of taking it, he recovered. His brother said: This is the formula presented earlier. Zhao was astonished and said: If it were not for the deceptive tactics of non-medical people misleading me, had I trusted this remedy sooner, would I have endured this suffering for so long? Now, I have tested and verified repeatedly—there are things that should not be exchanged. For instance, if vomiting stems from heat toxins affecting the heart, one should use Neituo San, also known as Wanjin San. If vomiting arises from weak spleen and stomach, one should use Jiazhu San. For heat toxins causing swelling and pain, Maimen Stone Gypsum should be used.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br>Yin deficiency causes thirst; the modified Eight Flavor Pills should be used. This situation has repeatedly confused physicians in the past, leading them to advise against its use, deeply sympathizing with the suffering of patients. Thus, I cite the example of Duke Zhao. </p>
<p>Xue Ji said: I foolishly believe that formulas are derived from imitation; they are formulated based on the causes of diseases. It is not that there are no formulas in the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; If one insists on using ancient formulas to treat contemporary illnesses, it is akin to dismantling an old house to match a new one. The dimensions and specifications differ; how could one expect to have a good fit without the craftsmanship of a skilled builder? Even if there is a match, considering it an unchanging ancient formula is misguided; this was the universal divine skill of the former kings. Why must it be kept secret and private?</p>
<p>I once observed Mr. Tai Wu treat a monk from Yunnan who, after traveling far to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, fell ill from longing for his family. The master generously provided him with food and herbal medicine, along with a gold coin to support his return. This is indeed the proper way of my medical practice. Yet, today&#39;s physicians may cling to the ancients, be secretive, or be obsessed with profit to mislead people; they have greatly violated the principles of knowledge and ethics.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br><strong>Volume 500 of the Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books in the Medical Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Use of Medicine</strong> (by Li Gao from the Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p>The method of using medicine emphasizes clarity and flexibility. Just as the wind may differ from ancient to modern times, the qualities of the land vary between the north and south, the timing of weather transforms with seasons, one’s constitution can be thick or thin, the nature of illnesses can be new or old, age distinctions exist between the young and the old, and social status defines the rich and the poor. When administering medicine, one should not be overly curious, nor should one cling to singular notions, be reckless, or act hastily. Caution and precision are essential; one must be adaptable and flexible, allowing for deep contemplation to ensure effectiveness. It is a lament that earlier sages did not articulate these principles, leaving later scholars ill-informed, thus leading to widespread confusion.</p>
<p>Illnesses may require tonics, which should be addressed with purging methods. Conversely, some illnesses may need purging, which must then be treated with tonics. If a condition calls for cold medicine, one should initiate treatment with heat; if warmth is needed, cold medicines should lead the way. Conditions located above should be treated from below, while those below should be treated from above. An illness may manifest in similar ways yet require different medicines, or it may present uniquely while responding to the same treatment. The subtleties are numerous, and scholars would do well to investigate deeply.</p>
<p>The primary prohibition in using medicine lies in the desire for speed. Aiming for rapid results can lead to improper application of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness in treatment, risking adverse outcomes without achieving any benefits. Medicine must be administered in proper order, just as soldiers must follow discipline. Even the bravest generals achieve success through proper strategies. It is also like untangling threads; a gentle approach can clear the knots, while haste only tightens them further.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br>This matter is hard to comprehend.</p>
<p>Since the time of Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor, although there have been many famous doctors, how many can truly be learned from? Consider the abdominal surgeries by the Hua family and the acupuncture of the Wang family; their techniques are indeed remarkable, but how can later generations emulate them? They are not like the sacred classics of Qibo, the fire cautery of Lei Gong, the herbal formulas of Yi Zhi, the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; of Jizi, the challenging questions from the Yue people, the &quot;Shang Han&quot; of Zhang Zhongjing, the &quot;Pulse Diagnosis&quot; of Shu He, the &quot;Jia Yi&quot; of Shi An, the annotations of Qiyuanzi, or the discussions of Qian Zhongyang. All these represent live practices that can be learned. Can extensive discussions and numerous formulas that merely validate what later generations see ever compare? Among them, those who are virtuous and accomplished, extraordinary talents and individuals, along with those who exist in high positions yet remain humble in obscurity, while they may have observable methods or principles, none give rise to lasting practices that can endure for centuries. Is it that I wish to quibble? No, I only wish for learners to look up to these sages and know whom to aspire to. Yet, there are those who, though they can extensively peruse and dabble everywhere, mistakenly believe themselves knowledgeable without utility—are they truly grasping the essence?<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br><strong>Sanitary Treasure: Medical Treatment by Fortune</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Luo Tianyi)</strong></p>
<p>In the autumn of the year Bingchen, a twenty-seven-year-old son of Mr. Jia from Chuqiu County fell ill with exhaustion in all four limbs, excessive heat and sweating, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, coughing with phlegm, discomfort in the chest, constipation, and a gaunt appearance. Over one year, he consulted several doctors without recovery. Some said: &quot;The skilled doctor is not as good as the lucky doctor.&quot; Although a certain doctor may not be proficient in prescriptions or aware of pulse conditions, he has treated numerous conditions with success, earning him the title of &quot;Fortune Doctor.&quot; </p>
<p>There is a saying: &quot;Even if you can read Wang Shuhe&#39;s texts, it’s not as good as my experience with many cases.&quot; This is rather credible, so I decided to try him. The doctor arrived, examined his pulse, and said: &quot;I am very familiar with this illness; treatment will surely be effective.&quot; He applied moxibustion on the points of the lungs three times seven, and used a formula of Pinellia and bitter orange to resolve phlegm and eliminate stagnation. After a few doses, the stool became excessively loose, causing abdominal pain and loss of appetite, which further escalated the weakness.</p>
<p>The son told his father that he had been ill for a long time and was unable to tolerate the medicine. The illness worsened, and he eventually died. During the winter, upon returning from military service, his father informed me, and I said: “The Inner Canon states: when the form and energy are insufficient, the disease&#39;s energy is also lacking; both yin and yang are deficient, and purging will exacerbate this insufficiency. When both yin and yang are depleted, the blood and energy are all exhausted, the five organs are empty, the bone marrow is dried out; the elderly will perish, and the young will find no recovery. Thus, it is said that insufficiency must be replenished; this is the principle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a prolonged illness resulting in emaciation indicates a deficiency in form; shortness of breath signifies a lack of energy; feelings of restlessness and an urge to lie down, along with languid limbs and a tendency to avoid speech, indicate that both energy and blood are deficient.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br>To supplement is to fear it may not be enough; instead, a small toxic remedy is used to purge, which makes the deficiency even more profound, weakening further. If not dead, what awaits? Duke Jia sighed and left. I sensed the matter and briefly explained its reasoning. A great physician, in curing illness, must first examine the seasonal excesses or deficiencies affecting the patient&#39;s condition, observe differences in their blood, energy, diet, and temperament. Diseases may vary in vacuity or repletion, their profundity, depending on the meridians or organs involved; medicines have hierarchies among sovereign, minister, assistant, and envoy, with variations in size and peculiarities. Treatments vary as to urgency and the principles of application and correction. Master Sun said: In all matters of great medicine, one must be well-versed in &quot;Jia Yi&quot;, the &quot;Suwen&quot;, the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;, &quot;Mingtang Liu Zhu&quot;, the twelve meridians, the three divisions and nine indications, the five viscera and six organs, the surface and interior points, the nature of medicinal substances, the doctrines of Zhang Zhongjing and Sun Simiao, and also profoundly understand the five elements and yin-yang theory; mastery of the &quot;Zhouyi&quot; is essential. Only thus can one be considered a great physician.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br>If not, then there are no eyes to guide one through the night, leading to stumbling and falling. To correctly establish the five musical tones, one must consult the laws and principles of Shi Kuang; only then can the five tones be made accurate. To determine shapes and dimensions, one must take the standards of Gongshu; only then can shapes and dimensions be achieved. The five tones and shapes are merely minor skills; hence, one should seek those who are proficient in the craft. How much more is this true for physicians, the custodians of human lives, categorized into four specialties—far beyond the comparison of the five tones and shapes? If one is not skilled in medicine, not familiar with pulses, not observant of the various classics, prescriptions, and herbal texts, yet claims to reach life and death matters by mere luck and is labeled as a fortunate physician, then patients entrust their lives to incompetent hands—how painful that is! Alas! The fortune of the physician is but a fortune of the fortunate. How can this fortune alleviate the sufferings of the sick? People in the world fail to understand this principle and entrust their lives to fortunate physicians, leading to injuries and loss of life, and in the end, they cannot comprehend; such is the greatest confusion—how tragic!<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br><strong>Danxi Heart Method</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Zhu Zhenheng)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Treating the Ill Before They Fall Ill</strong></p>
<p>Rather than trying to cure illness after it has occurred, it is better to nurture health before illness arises. Indeed, to administer medicine only after the onset of disease is futile. Thus, the practice of treating illness after it has developed is the way of doctors, while preventing illness before it arises is the essence of the principles of health preservation. If one anticipates and prevents troubles, what troubles could there be? This is the intent of the wise, who do not treat existing illness but address the unseen. For instance, one prepares earth to prevent water; if one does not block the trickling flow, the flood cannot be contained. One prepares water to combat fire; if one does not extinguish the flickering flame, the raging fire cannot be stopped. Since it is difficult to contain a surge of water or fire, how much more so for a disease already established? Therefore, one should go to bed early and rise early in the spring to prevent illness, and similarly, early rising and late resting in summer promotes health. These routines calms the body and tempers anger, enabling the fulfillment of one&#39;s ambitions, while embracing cooling and light foods to nourish vitality. Thus act the wise in the spring and summer, treating illness before it arises.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br>In the bright autumn, one must wait for sunlight in the hidden winter to gather the spirit, conceal aspirations, and keep one&#39;s intentions private; to nourish the yin with warming and hot food. This is how the sage treats illness before it arises in autumn and winter. Some say: to address a liver ailment, one must first strengthen the spleen; only then can the wood pathogen not spread. To address redness in the right cheek, one must first drain the heat from the lung meridian; only then can the metal pathogen not become dominant. This is indeed the method for preventing illness.</p>
<p>Now, to harmoniously adjust the spirit according to the four seasons as a means of preventing illness, what might this mean? To preserve one’s health and longevity is the path of the sage; to treat illnesses thoroughly is the skill of the superior practitioner. The discourse on treating illness only after it has occurred, in relation to the adjustment of the spirit in different seasons, carries a profound intention! In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor and the Heavenly Master had extensive exchanges where they never neglected nourishment; they first discussed innate nature, then the adjustment of spirit, applying principles of yin and yang followed by seasonal adjustments. They emphasized moderation in diet and regularity in daily activities, earnestly prioritizing health care, intending to prevent potential illnesses rather than react to severe diseases that are hard to remedy.</p>
<p>Later, the Qin state was slow to understand this principle. When the Duke of Jin experienced a serious ailment in the diaphragm, he was told: It cannot be treated. Bian Que understood this well; he diagnosed the Duke of Qi’s illness, which had reached the marrow, and declared: It cannot be saved. Alas! It is regrettable that the lords of Qi and Jin did not grasp the principles of preventing illness.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br>Examining the Pathology of Disease Without Losing the Correspondence to Qi</p>
<p>Evil Qi has its own specific origins, often tracing back to its essentials; therapeutic methods also have their corresponding conclusions, which should be preventively handled. The essence of treating disease lies in thoroughly understanding its sources first; if one does not comprehend the direction of the therapeutic principles, one is likely to err. Therefore, the emergence of disease, due to its multitude, does not transcend the Five Movements and Six Qi. If one can carefully examine and discern its critical points, then apply treatment accordingly, ensuring each aligns with the appropriateness of the Qi and seasons, one will not have even the slightest oversight. If so, the path to treating illness and finding its origins will be commendable. The Treatise on the True Essentials states: &quot;Examine the pathology of disease without losing the correspondence to Qi,&quot; implying deep meaning. It is often said that the essence of medical practice can be summed up in one phrase: it is the movements and Qi. Heaven represents Yang, while Earth represents Yin.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br>The two forces of Yin and Yang are each divided into three categories, known as the Three Yin and Three Yang. However, the heavens are not purely Yang; they also have Three Yin, while the earth is not purely Yin; it also has Three Yang. Therefore, both heaven and earth, above and below, have the six forces of wind, heat, fire, dampness, dryness, and cold that circulate and move between them, together with the five elements of wood, fire, metal, and water. Human beings exist within this, and the organs and energy points flow in correspondence with heaven and earth. Thus, one realizes that the origin of various diseases stems from this mechanism. However, how should medicine treat these conditions? One must carefully observe these phenomena to ensure nothing is overlooked before proceeding. For instance, all dizziness caused by wind relates to the liver and wood; all pains, ulcers, and itching pertain to the heart and fire; all swelling and fullness due to dampness relate to the spleen and earth; all stagnation of qi concerns the lungs and metal; and all contraction and withdrawal due to cold pertains to the kidneys and water—these disease mechanisms belong to the five elements.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br>All violent and rigid conditions belong to wind; all vomiting and sourness belong to heat; all restlessness and agitation belong to fire; all convulsions and rigidity belong to dampness; all dryness and desiccation belong to dryness; all diseases characterized by clear and cool water fluids belong to cold. This discussion of the pathological mechanisms relates to the six qi. The investigation of these mechanisms, while appearing to be thorough, cannot overlook the details in treating diseases. Therefore, it is essential to differentiate between yin and yang amidst confusion, and to discern the root and branches in subtle situations. For those who differ in existence and non-existence, seek the reasons for their differences; for those who differ in deficiency and excess, identify the reasons for their variations. Use sweat-inducing, vomiting, or purging methods according to appropriateness; apply hot, cold, warm, or cool treatments as required. Some may be countered to control subtle manifestations, while others follow to guide the more severe cases. Address higher matters by addressing the offenders of the qi from afar, tackle middle matters by discerning the transformations of seasonal changes, and handle lower matters by assessing southern and northern appropriateness. Ensure that larger and smaller matters are balanced, and that actions are timely and proportional; this is the basis of treatment.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br>Is it not the case that there are significant failures in deviation and disorder? Furthermore, examining the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it states: to treat illness, one must seek its root. The &quot;Herbal Classic&quot; states: to cure a sickness, one must first understand the mechanism of the illness. This is the essence of understanding the illness mechanism. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Six Primary Elements&quot; posits: do not disregard natural signs, and do not oppose vital energies. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Five Constant Elements&quot; states: one must first consider seasonal energies and not disrupt the harmony of nature. All of this reflects the importance of understanding vital energies. Thus, the texts of the &quot;Plain Questions&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; consistently emphasize the significance of vital energies. It has been stated: first determine the year to clarify its energies; and there is also a caution that those treating illness must understand heavenly principles, geographical factors, and the dynamics of yin and yang. Another statement asserts: without knowledge of the year’s progression, the rise and fall of energies, and the origin of deficiency and excess, one cannot be effective as a practitioner. These warnings are earnest, as though the sages had an unmanageable concern, illustrating that the essence of medical practice rests completely in these principles. Observing the &quot;Treatise on Origination of Illness,&quot; which categorizes and compares phenomena, reveals a profound understanding of the transformation of vital energies. This understanding is crucial for grasping the principles of illness mechanisms and vital energies.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br>The ability to harmonize color and pulse enables complete understanding.</p>
<p>To know what is within, one should observe the outside; diagnosis from the outer reveals the inner. What exists within manifests outwardly. If one does not correlate these aspects, understanding the nature of disease—whether it is progressing or regressing—cannot be achieved. A skilled practitioner illuminates the principles deeply, thus looking at the five colors: blue, yellow, red, white, and black, to relate them to the pulses of the five organs, exploring their responses and lack thereof; feeling the urgency, size, slackness, and depth of the five pulses, to associate them with the colors of the organs, determining alignment or misalignment. If one can truly perceive the subtle colors, diagnose the delicate pulses, and correlate the inner and outer aspects for treatment, then success in all endeavors can be achieved effortlessly. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: the ability to harmonize color and pulse can lead to complete success. This is its meaning. </p>
<p>The essence of the Dao is a unified qi, divided into yin and yang, dispersed into the five elements, all of which are possessed by humans. The five pulses are true to a person, circulating blood and qi, connecting yin and yang, nourishing the body; the five colors are the expressions of qi, corresponding to the five elements, aligning with the four seasons, illuminating the face.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br>Only by carefully observing colors and feeling pulses without neglecting either can one discern the mechanisms of illness, determine them with respect to cold and heat, attribute them to the organs, and treat them according to the symptoms, thereby achieving complete healing. For instance, if the liver color is as green as emerald feathers, its pulse should be slightly taut and rapid, which indicates vitality; if it is floating, weak, and short, with a color resembling withered grass, how could it thrive? If the heart color is as red as a chicken&#39;s comb, its pulse should be floating, large, and scattered, indicating harmony; if it is heavy, moist, and slippery, with a color like dark blood, how could it be harmonious? If the spleen color resembles the yellow of a crab’s belly, its pulse should be moderate, steady, and large, indicating compliance; if it is slightly taut and rapid, with a color like bitter orange, how could it comply? If the lung color is as white as pig fat, its pulse should be floating, weak, and short, indicating fortune; if it is floating, large, and scattered, with a color like dried bones, how could it be fortunate? Lastly, with the kidney color appearing as dark as crow feathers, its pulse should be heavy, moist, and slippery, indicating vitality; if the pulse is slow and large, with a color like coal, it indicates death.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br>The principle of life and death relies on mutual examination. Given this, when the medicine is applied, it corresponds to the ailment, and there will be no illness left untreated. Moreover, it has been discussed: the observable hues of the face correspond to specific areas; the pulse and breath have their respective positions within the inch, bar, and foot. The left cheek corresponds to the liver, aligned with the left wrist position, representing the wind wood and the initial qi. The forehead corresponds to the heart, aligned with the left wrist’s inch, representing the heart and small intestine, associated with the emperor fire and the second qi. The nose corresponds to the spleen, aligned with the right wrist pulse, representing the spleen and stomach, related to the damp earth and the fourth qi. The right cheek corresponds to the lungs, aligned with the right wrist inch, representing the lungs and large intestine, connected to the dry metal and the fifth qi. The jaw corresponds to the kidneys, aligned with the left wrist’s bar, representing the kidneys and bladder, associated with the cold water and the final qi. As for the fire of the heart, it corresponds to the third qi, which relates to the right wrist&#39;s mingmen and triple burner.<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br>The principle of the interaction of Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements should be harmonized with color and pulse. Thus, the &quot;Essentials of Pulse Diagnosis&quot; states: Colors correspond to the Five Elements, and pulses correspond to Yin and Yang. The &quot;Thirteen Difficulties&quot; states: Colors and pulses should correspond to each other. However, the complete practice of medicine cannot be achieved without this harmony of color and pulse. The &quot;Treatise on the Generation of the Five Organs&quot; says: The heart corresponds to the pulse, which reflects its color. The characteristics of the pulse—its size, texture, sinking or floating—can be differentiated, while the subtle diagnoses of the Five Colors can be observed. Following this, the ability to harmonize color and pulse can lead to comprehensive healing. Thus, the red pulse is characterized by being urgent and strong, the white pulse by being urgent and floating, the green pulse by being long and oscillating left and right, the yellow pulse by being large and weak, and the black pulse by being firm and large. This initially discusses the Five Colors, then the Five Pulses, intending for future scholars to focus on their harmonization. Later, Bian Que articulated this clearly, stating: To observe and know is called &#39;spirit,&#39; to feel and know is called &#39;skill,&#39; which is the essence of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; In later generations, practitioners have established methods, calling it &#39;spiritual skill and comprehensive perfection.&#39; How profound that is!<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br><strong>Tangye Ben Cao</strong> (by Wang Haogu in the Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p><strong>Observing the Severity of Illness</strong></p>
<p>In any case of wanting to treat illness, one must first investigate its source and gauge its timing. If the five organs are not depleted, the six bowels are not exhausted, the blood vessels are not chaotic, and the spirit is not dispersed, then taking medicine will surely be effective. If the illness has already developed, one may achieve partial recovery; if the condition has progressed too far, survival will be difficult. Unless one is a skilled physician who can discern through sound and color, and even pulse diagnosis, who can truly understand the illness that has not yet manifested?<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br><strong>On Medical Methods</strong></p>
<p>The discussions by the Qian family, as well as &quot;Living People,&quot; Wang Chaofeng, and Wang Defu, all originate from the Song dynasty, while Yi Lao and Shouzhen come from the Jin dynasty. The various medicines they used, differing in warmth and coolness, primarily derive from these sources. When reading these several books and applying their principles, one must also consider the appropriateness for the locality and the generations. However, nothing is better than taking principles from the pure ancients and synthesizing them with the formulas of Zhongjing, for this constitutes the unchanging great law for all ages.</p>
<p><strong>On Ancient Formulas</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and &quot;Questions of the Simple&quot; are reputedly the dialogues between the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo. Observing their meanings, they are clearly not the words of just one time, nor solely the work of one person. Liu Xiang attributed them to the sons of the various Han lords, while Chengzi said they originated at the end of the Warring States period. Their general ideas are akin to how &quot;The Book of Rites&quot; was compiled by Han scholars and transmitted along with the words of Confucius and Zisi. The &quot;Secret of the Linglan,&quot; &quot;Principles of the Five Constants,&quot; and &quot;Chronicle of the Six Origins,&quot; among other texts, merely elucidate the principles of yin, yang, and the five elements that govern existence, aligning symbols with virtues. They are directly applicable to the human body. The various colors, pulses, diseases, names, acupuncture points, and treatments all expand upon these principles. Similarly, Huangfu Mi&#39;s &quot;Jia Yi&quot; and Yang Shangshan&#39;s &quot;Tai Su&quot; are both based on this, albeit with slight differences. The overarching principles that medical practitioners must adhere to are found within these texts.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br>According to the &quot;Bibliography of Arts and Literature&quot; from the Western Han Dynasty, there are eighteen volumes of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; as well as two &quot;Inner Canons&quot; by Bian Que and the Bai family, totaling three versions; however, the title of &quot;Suwen&quot; is not listed. It wasn&#39;t until the Sui Dynasty&#39;s &quot;Catalogue of Classics&quot; that the name &quot;Suwen&quot; first appeared, and it was not identified as part of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; During the Tang Dynasty, Wang Bing made annotations based on the nine volumes of &quot;Jiu Ling,&quot; connecting them with the numbers in the Han record and also included discussions on Yin and Yang, claiming them to be the writings of his teacher, Zhang Gong, to compensate for what was lost. His efforts were indeed diligent. Unfortunately, there was a confusion of red and black ink, mixing precious stones and ordinary rocks, and the interpretations suffered from excessive leniency, with some references being rather inaccurate. Later in the Song Dynasty, scholars like Lin Yi and Gao Ruone corrected the erroneous texts and filled in the missing meanings, greatly benefiting Wang Bing&#39;s work. Now, in each section, noticing connections with the classics, I still quote passages and interpret them with my own understanding, hoping to engage in discussion with colleagues, not daring to carelessly criticize the earlier scholars.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; are not recorded in the catalogs of the Han, Wei, and Tang dynasties. In the Sui dynasty, there were nine volumes of the &quot;Needle Classic,&quot; and in the Tang dynasty, there were only the &quot;Spirit Treasure Annotations&quot; and the twelve volumes of the &quot;Yellow Emperor&#39;s Nine Spirits.&quot; Some say Wang Bing renamed the &quot;Nine Spirits&quot; to &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; and it is said that the &quot;Nine Spirits&quot; is particularly detailed regarding needles, which is why Huangfu Mi referred to it as the &quot;Needle Classic,&quot; corresponding to the nine volumes of the &quot;Needle Classic&quot; recorded in the Sui catalogs. If it is indeed a singular work with two names, there should not be an additional eleven or twelve volumes of the &quot;Needle Classic&quot; emerging in the Tang dynasty. The so-called &quot;Spirit Treasure Annotations&quot; are notes from Bian Que, the Supreme Source Lord, which have rarely been transmitted through the ages. In the late Song dynasty, there was a one-volume &quot;Brief of the Spiritual Pivot,&quot; which has also become lost. At the beginning of Shaoxing, Shi Song compiled this work into twelve volumes, restoring it to its former state, and compared to other editions, it is quite good. Scholars should study it alongside the &quot;Simple Questions,&quot; as their meanings illuminate each other.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br>&quot;Ben Cao&quot; consists of three volumes, formerly known as &quot;Shen Nong Ben Jing.&quot; The Han Dynasty&#39;s &quot;Yi Wen Zhi&quot; does not describe it in detail, but it was during the Liang Dynasty that Tao Yinju began to honor and document it, suggesting that this book should be grouped with the &quot;Su Wen.&quot; However, later generations primarily made revisions. The book was burned by the First Emperor of Qin, and it did not include medical formulas and divination, thus it was still able to be completely transcribed. When it suffered during the migration of Emperor Xian of Han and the chaos of Jin Huai, literary works were consumed by fire, and only rare remnants survived. What exists now are these three volumes of the original text, yet the counties and regions they mention are mostly from the Later Han period, casting doubt that they were recorded by Zhang Zhongjing and Hua Yuanhua. The original text listed only 365 types of medicine, which were then annotated and divided into seven volumes. During the Tang Dynasty, Li Yingong&#39;s achievements and Su Gong&#39;s references led to an addition of 114 types, dividing it into twenty volumes, commonly referred to as &quot;Tang Ben Cao.&quot; In the Song Dynasty, Liu Han and others further supplemented it with 220 types commonly used by physicians. The false Shu figure Meng Chang also ordered his minister Han Baosheng and others to refer to the Tang &quot;Tu Jing&quot; to expand it, which became known as &quot;Shu Ben Cao.&quot;<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br>During the Song dynasty, Yuxi and others compiled supplementary notes, resulting in a total of 1,082 medicinal substances combined from ancient and modern texts. The substances are categorized with white characters representing what Shen Nong said, and black characters indicating the transmissions of famous physicians. The range of herbs and minerals can be considered extensive. Regarding the works written by figures such as Lei Gong, Cai Yong, Xu Dashan, Qin Chengzu, Wang Jip, and Zheng Qian, there are a total of 39 volumes across 350 sections; though their content may vary in clarity, they all serve to support the old classics. In modern times, Chen Yan compiled &quot;A Compendium of Materia Medica,&quot; and Wang Haogu produced &quot;A Guide to Decoctions,&quot; both of which aimed to simplify previous complexities. I privately believe that the records of prefectures and counties have differed between ancient and modern times, and there are cases where one thing has different names based on its roots and sprouts, or where the same name applies to diverse qualities. It is essential to establish clear distinctions for proper therapeutic use. This would allow for a more unified understanding.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br>The &quot;Nanjing&quot; consists of thirteen volumes and is a work by the Qin man Zu Shu, who based it on the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;. It is set up as a dialogue to demonstrate to scholars, and many of the cited words are not from the texts of &quot;Ling&quot; or &quot;Su&quot;, as these ancient works have been lost to time. During the Sui Dynasty, there was a commentary by Lu Bowang, which did not spread; in the Song Dynasty, Wang Wei Yi compiled interpretations from five schools, but there were inconsistencies among them. Only the interpretations of the Yu family can be regarded as somewhat substantial. Ji Qiqing&#39;s commentary is rather detailed, but it mainly refutes the views of Yang Yuancao, Lu Guang, and Wang Zongzheng. Zhou Zhongli made several revisions, yet his investigations were not thorough. Li Ziye provided explanations at the sentence level but offered no insights. In modern times, Zhang Jiege added ancient evidence and prescriptions that are not particularly relevant to the original text. Wang Shaoqing elaborated on his views, naming it &quot;Chongyuan&quot;, but it was also insufficient to reveal the depths of earlier scholars&#39; thoughts. I have tried to compile the strengths of various schools, first explaining the terms and then interpreting the intentions, and I have humbly added my own comments in between for the convenience of future learners, but I do not dare to claim it as definitive. The &quot;Shanghan Lun&quot; consists of ten volumes and was composed by Zhang Zhongjing of the Later Han, using the principles of the &quot;Su Wen&quot; regarding fevers and basing it on the treatment methods of Yi Yin.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br>The Duke of Jin, Wang Shuhe, initially based his work on earlier theories and then reorganized and compiled them anew. Following him, Song Chengwuj, made annotations on this work. Later, figures such as Pang Anchang, Zhu Gong, Xu Shuwei, Han Dihe, and Wang Shizhi also elaborated on these ideas, but fundamentally, none of them went beyond the four methods of sweating, warming, and so forth. Indeed, each diagnosis corresponds to a specific remedy, and in thousands of years, it seems harmonious, pointing towards the ancestors of various prescriptions, which is certainly true. What can be lamented is the reliance on the familial sayings of Wang regarding the diagnosis of the three yin, which are frequently undifferentiated. Furthermore, the accounts of Zhang and Wang often mix the past and present, creating confusion. Without a thorough and thoughtful engagement with each character and phrase, it’s unlikely anyone can grasp the profound meanings. Chen Wuze once supplemented the medicinal prescriptions for the three yin in the &quot;Three Causes Treatise,&quot; and his intention can indeed be perceived. Recently, Xu Zhishan composed &quot;Supplementing the Lost of Cold Damage,&quot; which unfortunately may not align with the views of earlier scholars. Therefore, I have taken the liberty to present key points to supplement what Cheng&#39;s work lacks, hoping that the worthy physicians may find it useful.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br>The &quot;Classic of Pulses,&quot; in ten volumes, is based on the teachings of Wang Shuhe, the Chief Physician of the Western Jin, compiling the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; &quot;Simple Questions,&quot; &quot;Nine Spirits,&quot; as well as the theories of Bian Que and Zhang Zhongjing. It serves as a pivotal reference for the medical field, differing from modern interpretations and methods. Over the years, the transmission of this work has varied, with various secrets preserved and losses incurred. During the Song Dynasty, scholars like Lin Yi began to examine and correct the inaccuracies, making significant changes; their newly composed &quot;Classic of the Four Seasons,&quot; among others, was largely supplemented by the Lin family. Notable scholars such as Chen Konggu, He Daren, Mao Sheng, and Wang Zongqing have also reviewed and published their interpretations, although they are now rarely seen. More recently, Xie Jianbai utilized his collection of good editions to print a version in Yuzhang, which has helped its dissemination. I have gathered its essence and cited excerpts from the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; to create &quot;Essentials of Diagnosis and Pulse Taking,&quot; in two volumes, not intending to cut unnecessary repetitions but to also fill in gaps, and I included personal notes under each section for collaborative research among colleagues.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br>The &quot;Pulse Treatise,&quot; a single scroll, was composed by Gao Yang from the Six Dynasties, falsely attributed to the name of Shu He, misleading scholars with references to the Seven Tables, Eight Lines, and Nine Paths. Liu Yuanbin, the True Scholar, annotated it and added supplementary verses at the end. The language is crude, and the meaning is obscure. In today&#39;s era, Wang Guoguang has edited out the old expressions and enhanced it with new language; yet, it does not stray from its original paths, how could it possibly capture the essence? I, like Qingxi Xu Yi, Zhen Quan, Li Shangjiao, and others, have all composed our own works, totaling over ten families, and each has followed earlier interpretations, which Shu He himself did not accept. Readers are advised to only note the verses in order to be familiar with the &quot;Pulse Classic.&quot; The &quot;Discussion of Pathogens,&quot; in fifty volumes, was compiled by Chao Yuanfang, the chief physician of the Sui Dynasty, upon imperial decree. It elaborates on various diseases and includes methods for health preservation and guidance, forming a comprehensive book, though there are mixed merits and faults, which is evident.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br>The offices of the Song dynasty were used for examinations; the Yuan dynasty continued this practice, listing the seven classics of medicine. However, they mixed and merged ideas, no longer adhering to the old methods of the time, which knowledgeable individuals would recognize. Wu Jingxian also wrote a book titled &quot;Sources of Illness,&quot; which has not been passed down in modern times. The &quot;Heavenly Original Jade Book,&quot; consisting of ten volumes, remains unattributed; it is not recorded in the literary catalogs from the Han to the Tang dynasties. Its content does not resemble that of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and cannot be from the Warring States period. Among its contents, there are writings by the Celestial Sovereign, stating that if one follows the true way of non-action, there exists an original state before heaven, the nameless Great Change, and phrases similar to &quot;the Dao precedes existence,&quot; all reflecting the intentions of Laozi, likely authored by his followers. Broadly, the text explores the Five Movements and Six Energies, the governance of heaven and earth, the interplay of subjects and guests, political morality and correction, as well as the Three Origins, Nine Palaces, Great Unity, and governance, which are exceptionally detailed and significantly enhance the subtle principles of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and other chapters on the Five Constants of governance.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br>The Taiyuan Lord&#39;s commentary on Bian Que is akin to Guo Xiang&#39;s interpretations of the Nan Hua, and is not easy to comprehend through the teachings of the mind school. Observing the consistency in the texts and commentaries suggests they came from the same author. While Bian Que is identified as a person from Qin and Yue, there is no mention of the title Taiyuan Lord in the transmission. Older traditions often imitate this style. </p>
<p>The &quot;Secret Words of the Original Pearl,&quot; a ten-volume work, is presented by Qiyuanzi. In its preface, it states that Qiyuanzi was fortunate enough to encounter and study under the Original Pearl Master, thus calling himself Qiyuanzi as he sought enlightenment from the Original Pearl. The title &quot;Secret Words of the Original Pearl&quot; refers to the teachings passed down privately by the Original Pearl Master. When examining the preface of Wang&#39;s &quot;Plain Questions,&quot; it notes that the principles and reasoning are obscure and challenging to discuss, prompting the separate creation of the &quot;Original Pearl&quot; to explain its doctrine; both prefaces are similar in nature. </p>
<p>The implication is that the name Original Pearl is derived from Meng and Zhuangzi, specifically regarding the phrase about the Yellow Emperor leaving the Original Pearl, which is said to be elusive. Therefore, claiming one learns from the Original Pearl Master and titles oneself Qiyuan is unfounded.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br>Song Gao Baoheng and others revised the &quot;Neijing,&quot; and said: The detailed account of Wang&#39;s &quot;Yuan Zhu&quot; has no transmission in the world; the current &quot;Yuan Zhu&quot; is merely a text attributed by later generations. Although it is not Wang&#39;s work, it still has some insights regarding the &quot;Suwen,&quot; particularly in the ninth and twenty-fourth volumes. I have compared the &quot;Suwen&quot; and found that the secret writings therein discuss the theory of the six qi and do not match at all with the volumes referenced by the Gao family, leading me to suspect that the transmitted versions contain errors. Tracing back to its origins, it likely compiles the subtle meanings of the &quot;Neijing&quot; and the fundamental essentials of five essays, along with essential words from the &quot;Tian Yuan Yu Ce,&quot; mingled with miscellaneous theories. The records of qi movements and auspices may not be reliable, and it is indeed a spurious text. If the original author made a separate compilation, it would surely have been known to the world; it would not merely address the aspect of qi movements. Readers may take the strengths and discard the weaknesses. The &quot;Zhong Zang Jing,&quot; in eight volumes, states that Laozi traveled to the ancient cave of Mount Yishan, where he encountered two old men who imparted methods for healing. He obtained a stone bed with writings and used it for trial, which proved very effective.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br>I am the grandson of the teacher. While visiting the teacher&#39;s chamber, I had a dream in which I received a teaching, and I found this book in a stone box. The pretense is so absurd that it cannot withstand scrutiny, especially regarding the true account of the officials burning books, which serves to expose its falsehood. According to the &quot;Tang Records,&quot; there is a collection of prescriptions by Wu Pu from the family of Hua. There is no other name for it in the central archives. Pu is his disciple, and it should be a compilation of his own. I suspect that these writings could not have been produced by individuals of the Pu lineage; rather, the Deng family merely attached a separate formula and renamed it. The reason the formula includes the &quot;Taiping&quot; coins and &quot;mountain yam&quot; is because &quot;Taiping&quot; was the era name in the early years of Song Xiling, and &quot;yams&quot; were initially named &quot;mountain yams&quot; to avoid a later taboo. The rest can be inferred similarly. However, discussions on pulse diagnosis and observations of sounds and colors must originate from the intentions of the original transformations. Readers should carefully assess it for themselves.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br>The &quot;Sheng Ji Jing,&quot; in ten volumes, was composed by Song Huizong. It primarily expounds upon the &quot;Nei&quot; and &quot;Su,&quot; while also referencing the Six Classics and touching upon the teachings of Laozi to elucidate the essence of the Xuanqi. During the Zhenghe era, this text was issued to the two academies, and Wu Ti, a student at the Biyong, was appointed to lecture on it. </p>
<p>The chapters on the Path and proper governance can truly benefit political affairs and enlighten many skilled workers. As for the sections on the creation of characters and naming objects, although I dissect their meanings, my interpretations may be forced, stemming from a failure to thoroughly study the Six Writings. Both flaws and merits exist, yet they do not diminish the value of fine jade.</p>
<p>In discussing the various physicians, it is said: Bian Que&#39;s medicine was like Qin’s lamp illuminating objects—beauty and ugliness are evident, and akin to Yi Qi’s encounters with opponents, each move could be strategic, yet observers could not discern his divine skills. Cang Gong’s medicine resembles a wheel with a skilled hand, adeptly working without the need for clever words. Zhang Changsha was like the teacher of Tang and Wu, adhering strictly to the royal way; his strategies in offense and defense were uniquely effective, capable of overcoming any enemy regardless of size.</p>
<p>Hua Yuanhua&#39;s medicine resembled that of a cook skillfully cutting up an ox, his blade moving effortlessly and precisely; his harmony in craftsmanship surely had a divine quality, and although one might wish to learn from it, it could not be attained.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br>Sun Simiao&#39;s medical approach resembles that of Kang Sheng in his annotations, being detailed in interpretation. The essence of his understanding is not easily conveyed to others; savoring its richness can alleviate hunger. Pang Anchang&#39;s medicine could unveil the secrets of Bian Que and follow the transformative principles of nature, ensuring that when granted the years, his results would not fall behind those of the ancients. Qian Zhongyang&#39;s medical strategies were akin to Li Jing&#39;s military tactics, measured in maneuvering and strategic retreats, ultimately aligning with established principles. He first gained fame with the &quot;Skull and Brain Formula,&quot; reflecting the importance placed on adapting methods to the era as Bian Que did. Chen Wuze&#39;s practice is similar to an old official adjudicating cases, profoundly engaged in interrogations, yet he might let emotions sway him towards the law; if left to his own devices, his results would be ample, but if substituted, would become overly complicated. Xu Shuwei&#39;s medicine resembles Gu Kaizhi&#39;s artistry, rich in spirit and energy, distinctly not confined to mere resemblance, exemplary yet unattainable.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br>Zhang Yishui&#39;s medicine is like Lianxi&#39;s diagram of the Taiji, dividing yin and yang, encompassing principles and qi. Its essence is to use ancient methods for new ailments, making it a household practice; if one misjudges and aims for extreme measures, it is akin to adding legs to a snake. Liu Hejian&#39;s medicine is like a camel planting trees, ensuring survival everywhere, but relying on ice and snow as spring. It benefits pines and cypresses but not willows and poplars. Zhang Zihe&#39;s medicine is like an old general facing an enemy, sometimes deploying troops with their backs to water or burning the river with dan, placing them in desperate situations to create life; if one does not master this, victory is elusive. His six gates and three methods are indeed remnants of Changsha&#39;s teachings. Li Dongyuan&#39;s medicine is like a stringed instrument with new silks; when struck, all harmony ceases. It is like bonding with glue, yet the seven strings do not resonate in tune; the essence of harmonious sounds is not something that can be understood merely by opening fingers. Yan Zili&#39;s medicine is like Ouyang Xun writing; he skillfully adheres to rules without promoting flamboyance, making it easier for learners to imitate, yet ultimately lacking the charm of the Han and Jin dynasties. Zhang Gongdu&#39;s medicine specializes in the methods of Zhongjing, much like a poet from Jianzhai, imbued with the spirit of Shaoling. Wang Defu&#39;s medicine is like a fisherman casting nets in open fields, capturing many hares, encountering strange situations that yield game – it is not something that can be easily calculated.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br><strong>On Medicine</strong></p>
<p>The texts of medicine, from the &quot;Neijing&quot; onward, are preserved by the authorities, amounting to one hundred seventy-nine families, two hundred nine works, and one thousand two hundred fifty-nine volumes, while subsequent miscellaneous writings are not included. The &quot;Neijing&quot; is read as the work of the Yellow Emperor; although scholars before the Qin dynasty imitated and attributed their thoughts to it, its words are profound and its meanings vast and deep, truly representing the core tenets of medical practitioners, much like the Six Classics do for Confucian scholars. The &quot;Eighty-One Difficulties&quot; by a man from Qin and Yue continues this tradition, summarizing and clarifying the essential points of the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo, but it is inferior to the &quot;Neijing.&quot; Han Dynasty&#39;s Zhang Zhongjing, drawing from the essence of the &quot;Neijing&quot; and &quot;Nanjing,&quot; produced the &quot;Jinkui Yaoluan&quot; and discussions on febrile diseases, with his analysis of the six qi injuries being the most detailed.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br>King Shuhe of Jin compiled the writings of Qibo, Hua Tuo, and others into the &quot;Classic of Pulses,&quot; which discusses yin and yang internally and externally, differentiates the three divisions and nine conditions, identifies the points of human reception of Qi, outlines the twelve meridians, and details the diseases of the three burners, five organs, and six bowels, all with remarkable precision. The works of these two scholars are indeed classics that endure through the ages. Subsequently, Chao Yuanfang wrote &quot;On the Sources of Disease,&quot; and Wang Bing composed &quot;The Jade Strategies of Heaven,&quot; both of which draw on ancestral teachings. However, Yuanfang spoke of wind and cold, and two types of dampness, while neglecting the concept of damp-heat, and Bing theorized about the changes of the five movements and six Qi, focusing on stagnation rather than flow, which were shortcomings. Later, during the Tang dynasty, Sun Simiao emerged with extraordinary insights and deep compassion for humanity, listing formulas in &quot;Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold,&quot; which enlightened preceding and succeeding scholars and greatly contributed to the medical field. At that time, Wang Tao had &quot;The Secret Essentials of the Outer Chamber,&quot; discussing formulas and methods in detail; yet he stated that needles can end a life but cannot revive the dead, which represents a one-sided view. By the Song dynasty, Qian Yi, Pang Anshi, and Xu Shuwei rose in prominence.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br>Pang was confined within the confines of established measures, while Xu was devoted to ingenuity and adaptability, both drawing from the teachings of Zhang Zhongjing. Only Qian deeply explored the profound mysteries of Zhang Zhongjing, establishing methods for the five organs, each suited for its specific use. It is said that when the liver has excess fire, it should be purged rather than replenished, while the kidneys, being true water, can be replenished but not purged; this could be considered revealing the secrets of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; Regrettably, his writings have been lost, and what survives, gathered by Yan Xiaozhong, is not the original truth. In the era of Daguang, the formulas compiled by Chen Shiwen, Pei Yuanzong, and others, totaling two hundred ninety-seven, aimed to use fixed formulas to address countless diseases, though those who understand know that they lack insight into the principle of adaptability. The presence of the Jin family in the Central Plains is attributed to four individuals: Zhang Jiefu, Liu Shouzhen, Zhang Zihe, and Li Ming, who contributed to the revival of the medical path.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br>The ancient principles, while new to modern ailments, cannot adequately address them; thus, the methods of treatment are not conveyed in their texts, but their teachings are indeed profound. They illuminate the internal and external dual afflictions, particularly emphasizing the treatment of the spleen and stomach, focusing on supplementation. The work &quot;On the Spleen and Stomach&quot; is truly foundational. </p>
<p>Zihe proposed three methods involving sweating, purging, and harmonizing, identifying six pathogenic factors: wind, cold, heat, dampness, fire, and dryness, which are key to medicine. His treatments are often severe and offensive in nature. </p>
<p>In discussing the diseases brought about by wind and fire, the discussion relies on the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; outlining nineteen pathogenic mechanisms termed &quot;Original Disease Models,&quot; which explore intricate details; however, their treatment methods differ from Zihe&#39;s. </p>
<p>Zhang’s teachings were repeatedly passed down yet became obscure afterward. The disciples of Li primarily resided in Zhongzhou, while only the Liu family transmitted their teachings to the priest in Jing Mountain. The priest spread this knowledge in Jiangnan, subsequently passing it to Luo Zhiti of the Song dynasty, who was revered by Southern physicians. </p>
<p>In more recent times, discussions of medicine predominantly concern the teachings of Liu and Li. Although their methods of attack and supplementation differ, they converge and interlink, adapting according to the clinical manifestations. Does the essence of their teachings no longer exist?<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br><strong>Excerpt on Filial Piety in Medicine</strong></p>
<p>In Northern Qi, Li Yuanzhong’s mother was elderly and frequently ill. Yuanzhong dedicated himself to the art of medicine and studied diligently for many years, thus becoming proficient in this skill. His cousin, seeing his own mother suffer from illness, also sought to treat her and, when she did not recover, devoted himself to the study of acupuncture and herbal remedies, ultimately curing her. During the Sui Dynasty, Xu Daoyou also sought out medical texts due to his mother&#39;s ailments, and through extensive reading, gained profound knowledge, earning the title of famous physician. He advised his sons, saying: a son ought to be attentive to both diet and medicine; if he does not know the principles of treatment, can he truly be considered filial? This became a teaching passed down through generations.</p>
<p>Tang poet Wang Bo once stated that a son cannot be ignorant of medicine. At that time, there was a secret technique in Chang’an by Cao Yuan, which Bo learned about during his visits and obtained its essentials. What Bo encountered genuinely enhanced his understanding of the craft. In the Tang Dynasty, Wang Tao also learned medicine due to his mother’s illness and published his works in the world. In the Song Dynasty, Gao Ruone, motivated by his mother’s sickness, became well-versed in medical texts, so much so that even the eminent national physicians respected him. Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Treatise on Cold Damage and Sun Simiao’s prescriptions along with &quot;Essentials of the External Respository&quot; had long been overlooked; he carefully examined and corrected their records for circulation. It was then understood that many renowned physicians originated from Weizhou, all learning from the Gao clan. This thus exemplifies the link between medicine and filial piety.</p>
<p>In the Song Dynasty, Li Xujì’s mother lost her eyesight. Xujì diligently licked her eyes daily without fail. After two years, her sight was restored. Li Xingjian’s father suffered from painful boils; Xingjian sucked the pus from them without spitting on the ground, and the illness soon settled. This further highlights the connection between filial piety and medicine.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br><strong>On Medicine</strong><br>By Wang Wenlu (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>Medicine is about intention. It involves understanding the timing of diseases and determining their causes, as well as establishing treatments, just as heavenly principles and sacred teachings may differ. In the Yuan dynasty, customs were extravagant, leading to rich tastes and a humid, hot environment, which often resulted in many illnesses. Therefore, Zhu Danxi was taught methods to clear heat and lower fire, distinguishing them from the warm tonifying methods of the “Formula for Harmonious Medicaments,” correcting excesses. However, while hot medicines of the &quot;Formula&quot; are certainly not permissible, relying solely on Danxi’s cold medicines is also not appropriate. Especially now, as the vital energy is increasingly depleted, treating with Danxi’s methods often harms the spleen and stomach. This is because phlegm arises from spleen dampness, heat from spleen deficiency, and it is imperative to employ the method of supplementing the spleen from Dongyuan as a principal approach. Thus, it is crucial for physicians to carefully discern the flow of vital energy, observe human conditions, and identify the origins of diseases.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br><strong>The Correct Transmission of Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Yu Tuan)</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Medicine&#39;s Origins</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: &quot;The origins of medicine trace back to Xuandi and Qiyi, where medical practices gained recognition in the world, and several individuals authored texts for future generations to follow. How many have done this?&quot; I shall clarify this for you! I have read the writings of the scholar Song Gong Jinglian and have derived my understanding from them. Let me present it as follows: Although the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; is suspected to have been written by scholars of the pre-Qin period imitating earlier works, its arguments are profound and concise, its principles intricate and broad, and its examination and debate are credible and substantiated; it ought to serve as the foundational text for medical practitioners. Following this are the Qin and Yue people, represented by He Huan. He Huan left no texts to pass down, while the Yue people wrote the &quot;Eight-One Difficulties,&quot; which articulates and clarifies the essentials of the &quot;Neijing.&quot; Below them are Chunyu Yi and Hua Tuo. Tuo&#39;s manipulation of the bones certainly belongs to the realm of guiding techniques. As for his method of opening the abdomen and cleansing the stomach and intestines to remove sickness, this drifts into the supernatural.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br>Regarding the medical conditions described by Sima Qian, the &quot;Wei Feng&quot; and &quot;Ta Feng&quot; are conditions that modern people do not understand at all, let alone seek their deeper treatments. Furthermore, there are texts such as Zhang Ji&#39;s &quot;Jin Kui Yu Han Jing&quot; and various treatises on typhoid fever, which are indeed timeless classics that elaborate on injuries caused by the six qi, yet they neglect the ailments arising from improper desires related to food, drink, and labor, and their texts are also confusing and difficult to systematically analyze. Below this, we have Wang Shuhe, who compiled the writings of Qi Bo and Hua Tuo into the &quot;Mai Jing,&quot; discussing yin and yang, the internal and external, identifying the three divisions and nine pulses, distinguishing the person’s welcoming, qi, and mouth, and detailing the twelve meridians, as well as the diseases of the three burners, five organs, and six bowels, making it quite clear. Unfortunately, due to the superficial interpretations by ignorant men, the essence of this work has not flourished in the world. Following this, there is Chao Yuanfang. Although his later compilation &quot;Disease Sources&quot; may not be unobservant, it primarily discusses the two qi of wind and cold, without addressing the principles of dampness and heat, which is its shortcoming. Then we have Wang Bing, who proposed the changes in the five movements and six qi and wrote &quot;Tian Yuan Yu Ce,&quot; which is detailed and intricate, yet difficult for people to grasp; if one becomes muddled in it, they will be stagnant and unable to make progress. Lastly, we have Wang Tao and Sun Simiao.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br>Si Miao, with unparalleled discernment, wielded a heart of compassion and empathy. His discussions on the &quot;Thousand Gold&quot; remedies and the dangers of unskilled practice elicited strong emotions. Subsequent generations, although they breached his boundaries, could still echo his teachings; however, those who do not establish texts on the treatment of cold ailments may indeed face regrets. </p>
<p>Tao, though he elucidated the &quot;Essentials of the Outer Treasury,&quot; contained some confusion in his explanations pertaining to the precise restrictions of cautery and moxibustion. He held a rather narrow view in stating that needles can harm the living but cannot revive the dead. Below him were Qian Yi, Pang Anshi, and Xu Shuwei. Xu Shuwei adhered to established standards but did not make any innovations. Anshi, despite his skill in unconventional responses, ultimately remained within conventional limits; both were merely adept in the rudiments of acupuncture. </p>
<p>Only Yi delved deeply into the profound principles of this art, extracting its essence and establishing remedies tailored for the five organs, according to their specific needs. He asserted that the liver, having excess fire, should be purged rather than supplemented, while the kidneys, representing true water, should be supported without purging. These insights revealed the mysteries of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; particularly the methods known to the knowledgeable.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br>The world classifies medicine through the lens of infants, how shallow is its understanding! The texts that have been lost, collected by Yan Xiaozhong, largely reflect his own intentions and are not the true essence of this knowledge. Below him are Zhang Yuan Su from Shanggu, Liu Wansuo from Hejian, and Zhang Congzheng from Suishui. Although Yuan Su and Wansuo created strange dreams and unusual figures to mystify their teachings, they actually rose in response to the trends of this knowledge. As for Congzheng, he is again aligned with Wansuo. </p>
<p>Yuan Su, using ancient methods to address modern ailments, found that they simply could not correlate; he treated diseases without relying on established formulas, which is why his writings have not been transmitted. Those that exist today are all later interpretations. His academic lineage is traced through Li Gao of Dongyuan, who absorbed these teachings deeply. </p>
<p>Gao clarified the inner and outer injuries and focused much on the theory of nourishing the spleen as the foundation. He believed that soil is the master of the body; when the soil is balanced, all organs are at peace. Congzheng advocated for treatments including inducing sweating, utilizing three methods, and addressed the six factors of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire as crucial to medicine. His approach often relied on aggressive treatment strategies, which, if misapplied by the unwise, could lead to death. </p>
<p>Wansuo discussed diseases of wind and fire, with the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; delineating the pathogen mechanisms in a way that is encapsulated in nineteen criteria forming the &quot;Original Disease Methods.&quot; The profound intricacies therein are not something the common physicians in great institutions can easily imitate.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br>In examining its foundations, it mainly revolves around the dual aspects of attack and supplementation. Among modern famous physicians, there are those like Luo Tiantian from Wuzhong, who interpret and supplement based on the textual meanings, and Lü Fu from Cangzhou, who carries on the legacy of Dongyuan. Luo Zhiti from Wulin and Zhu Yanxiu from Danxi both draw from the refined essence of their predecessors. Additionally, there are writers like Zhu Zuo from Taiwan and Hua Shou from Yue, whose contributions are numerous and not easily listed. Alas! Since the time of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; there have been 179 notable medical writers, 209 works, and 1,259 volumes in total, which is indeed quite a lot. However, when speaking of the most prominent physicians throughout the ages, how can one possibly enumerate them all? </p>
<p>Someone asked: &quot;Since the origin of medical teachings has been clearly articulated, what path does your learning follow?&quot; The tradition states: &quot;A physician cannot adhere to the medicine of three generations.&quot; Some interpret this to mean that the grandfather&#39;s teachings passed down define the three generations; others argue that mastering the texts of the three generations qualifies one as a physician of those three generations.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br>Did you read the books of the three generations? Is this knowledge passed down from your grandfather&#39;s family? Please clarify the reason for this. The response is: Can we speak of the trivial knowledge from the wilds? Yet medicine does not stop at the three generations; what, then, limits its texts to the three dynasties? We should only speak of what is legitimate and applicable. I have a fellow townsman, Mr. Zhu Yanxiu of Danxi, who inherited the teachings of the Liu, Zhang, and Li families, and found his foundation in the works of Luo Taiwuwei, thus his medical skills have resonated widely in the present era, with people far and near taking him as a model. As for me, I am fortunate to be a contemporary of Mr. Danxi, sharing the same hometown with my ancestor, Lord Chengzhai, and therefore I also benefit from his guidance, gaining a reputation for my skills. Thus, the family tradition that I inherit has a lineage. I can only feel regret that my talent is dull and insufficient, and I cannot elevate the legacy of my forebears; this is my sorrow. What more is there to say? Someone asked: The lifespan of a person, whether long or short, is predetermined by fate. Every life must have its flowering; this has been true since ancient times. How does medicine help? The response is: What is called fate refers to the original qi of heaven and earth, the parents. The father represents heaven, the mother represents earth. The essence of the father and the blood of the mother vary in their abundance and decline, therefore, the lifespan and early death of people also differ.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br>At the beginning of life, those who are influenced by balanced energies will achieve a long life; those influenced by imbalanced energies will have a shorter life; and those whose energies are waning can only preserve a brief existence, or else they face early death. Nevertheless, one must not merely adhere to common logic. External influences such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness, as well as internal injuries from hunger, overeating, or overwork, cannot be entirely governed by one&#39;s inherent vital energy. Thus, in ancient times, the divine farmer experimented with various herbs and created medicine to support the populace, allowing each to reach their natural lifespan. Nowadays, there are those who, despite rejecting physicians in favor of shamans, end up dying prematurely, showing no difference from those shackled by sheer rock walls! Some say that present-day fortune-tellers calculate destinies based on celestial bodies at the time of birth, with occurrences of life and death reflecting these stars in an orderly manner. However, using the parents&#39; vital energies as a measure of heavenly mandate may not be the most appropriate perspective. It is said that the principles of heaven and humanity always correspond, just as the river diagrams and Luo charters reveal — the sages used them to draw the hexagrams and compile the Book of Changes.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br>In every movement and stillness of a person, there lies the principle of good and bad fortune, the paths of progress and retreat, existence and extinction, which can be used for divination with precision. However, the wise and virtuous instruct us to exhaust human effort in accordance with heavenly will, so that misfortunes can be transformed into fortunes, and those who are lost may gain life. They never advocate leaving everything to fate. It is said: &quot;Cultivate oneself and wait for destiny.&quot; Therefore, a physician can connect with the divine and influence transformation, capable of extending the life of the prematurely dying and allowing the long-lived to attain immortality. Can the art of medicine be disregarded?</p>
<p>Some ask: In ancient times, physicians had the discipline of spells and incantations; why is it not utilized today? I reply: The discipline of spells refers to the &quot;Su Wen&quot; healing methods. Established by the scholar Longshu, it pertains to techniques for transforming essence and spirit, capable of treating minor ailments. Sometimes, men and women entering temples become bewildered and ill, or they may encounter malevolent energies in mountains and valleys, presenting symptoms akin to drunkenness or confusion, which are caused by evil spirits attaching themselves. For all symptoms of mental distress, spells can be used to resolve confusion and restore peace. In ancient times, the spell methods of Longshu circulated widely, but today they have morphed into practices of sorcery, trickery, and manipulation, cheating the people. Alas! Malicious arts are employed by malicious individuals; those who understand the principles should not use them.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br><strong>Medical Discourse</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: Among the writings of Zhang Zhongjing, Dongyuan, Hejian, and Danxi, which is superior? Which should one focus on studying? The answer is: One should primarily concentrate on the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; while broadly observing the teachings of the four masters; this way, there will be no faults. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; is to medicine what the Six Classics are to Confucianism and Daoism, as it encompasses everything; the teachings of the four masters are like the &quot;Xue,&quot; &quot;Yong,&quot; &quot;Yue,&quot; and &quot;Meng,&quot; serving as steps to the Six Classics, and none can be omitted. There is no distinction of superiority or inferiority among the four works; rather, each elucidates one particular principle. Zhang Zhongjing, noting that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; contains references to cold damage but lacks a comprehensive account of its variations and transformations, therefore authored his writings to elaborate on these changes.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br>Later generations have revered these teachings, and as they have been passed down for so long, the true essence has gradually been lost. They were used to address the ailments caused by heat and cold, leading to misguidance. Thus, the Hejian school emerged, beginning to elucidate methods for treating heat illnesses, and the Dongyuan school emerged, starting to clarify methods for treating internal injuries. The theories from Hejian are in line with the principles of the &quot;Neijing&quot; regarding the five movements and six energies; the teachings from Dongyuan align with the &quot;Neijing&quot; concerning diet and fatigue. It is not that Zhongjing was unaware of the relationship between heat illnesses and internal injuries, but rather that he had not covered these topics in his writings. When it comes to treating cold damage, both Hejian and Dongyuan strictly follow Zhongjing’s principles and dare not deviate. Later, Danxi synthesized the contributions of various physicians, elucidating conditions of Yin deficiency leading to fever and the many diseases resulting from damp heat and internal fire, also documenting these according to symptoms, ultimately just expounding upon the essential meanings of the &quot;Neijing&quot; and supplementing what previous sages had overlooked. Therefore, it is said: for external pathogens, one follows Zhongjing; for internal injuries, one follows Dongyuan; for heat disease, one employs Hejian; for miscellaneous ailments, one turns to Danxi. To integrate these approaches constitutes the comprehensive path of medicine. </p>
<p>Some may question: Zhongjing&#39;s prescriptions use very few medicinal ingredients, while Dongyuan’s often exceed twenty.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br>Dan Xi said: Whenever I treat illness, I follow the methods of Dong Yuan in using medicine and the prescriptions of Zhong Jing, hoping that by limiting the dosage, the efficacy of the medicine will be concentrated. Why then does Dan Xi not follow Dong Yuan and instead emulate Zhong Jing? It is said: In understanding the properties of medicine, no one surpasses Dong Yuan; he is truly the sage among physicians. Therefore, in Dong Yuan&#39;s case, it is acceptable to use more. If others emulate this excess, it can lead to confusion. Dong Yuan, like Han Xin in commanding troops, believes that more is better. However, Dan Xi can only manage a hundred thousand, thus does not dare to imitate the excess.</p>
<p>Someone asked: It is said that in the southeast where the climate is hot, one can take cooling medications; in the northwest where the climate is cold, one can take warming medications. Yet, people in the southeast often consume pepper, ginger, and cassia without falling ill, while those in the northwest avoid spicy and warming foods. Why is this? It is said: Although the southeast is hot, the land is low and often damp, and spicy, warming foods and medicines can also help eliminate dampness; while the northwest, although cold, has high and dry terrain, thus spicy, warming foods and medicines can help combat dryness.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br>To treat illnesses with medication, one must understand this principle! Master Danxi treats diseases without departing from the concepts of qi, blood, and phlegm, therefore the key to using medicine lies in three formulations: for qi, use the Four Gentleman Decoction; for blood, use the Four Substance Decoction; for phlegm, use the Erchen Decoction. Furthermore, he states that prolonged illness leads to stagnation, hence the necessity to adopt methods to treat stagnation, such as the Yueju Pill. It can be said that the three ailments of qi, blood, and phlegm often coexist with stagnation, whether stagnation arises from prolonged illness, illness causes prolonged stagnation, or misprescriptions lead to stagnation. Consequently, whenever I treat illnesses, I always incorporate methods for stagnation. If an ailment of qi accompanies stagnation, then add an herb to resolve stagnation to the Four Gentleman Decoction; the same applies for ailments of blood and phlegm. Therefore, these four methods are essential for treating illnesses with medicine. Master Danxi also notes that in recent times, many who treat diseases do not distinguish between qi and blood, merely noticing a deficiency in qi and then using ginseng and astragalus. This is indeed appropriate for qi deficiency; however, if it is blood deficiency, does this not bolster qi while depleting yin-blood? This is referred to as treating blood ailments with qi, which aggravates the depletion of blood and can lead to both qi and blood becoming deficient.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br>Therefore, when treating illness with medicine, it is essential to clearly distinguish between Qi and blood; they must not be confused. In ancient times, it was said: when I am ill, if I write the character for death in front of my chest from time to time, all my thoughts will cease, and my heart will find peace, which is better than taking medicine. This is truly a supreme method. If one is not cautious in illness, then death is inevitable. Those who understand this principle can cultivate a clear mind and self-discipline, being attentive in all matters, and they can recover from illness. Otherwise, even with good medicine, there will be no remedy. People often encounter illness yet indulge in their emotions and recklessness, harming themselves; this shows they do not truly fear death. There are also those who, knowing they fear death, are afraid of others discovering it. They remain silent about their condition or feign a light attitude even when seriously ill to deceive others; this is knowing the fear of death yet inadvertently courting it, which is particularly absurd.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br>Dongyuan and Danxi often created their own prescriptions for treating illnesses, as both scholars had a deep understanding of the properties of medicinal herbs and an in-depth knowledge of the essential methods from the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; Since the Song Dynasty, pre-made prescriptions have been widely adopted, and people have not dared to create their own with rashness. Although the arguments in the pre-made prescriptions often contain many inaccuracies, Danxi has debated these points. Nevertheless, the formulas are all composed by renowned physicians, and their hierarchical structure, dosage, urgency, and proportions are generally accurate. Recently, the works of Dongyuan and Danxi have become popular, and contemporary doctors, noticing that they do not use ancient formulas, tend to imitate their practices and create their own prescriptions. However, lacking clarity on the properties of the medicines and not comprehending the reasoning behind the prescriptions, they end up causing confusion, with varied and troublesome symptoms arising, making it difficult to recognize and treat them. Furthermore, since different medicines have distinct flavors, for instance, Schisandra has a thick flavor, Dongyuan&#39;s prescription calls for five or six grains at a minimum and up to a dozen at most, whereas contemporary doctors may use two or three taels. Gypsum has a light flavor, thus Baihu Decoction uses half a tael, while modern doctors do not dare to use more.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br>To supplement the treatment, one should focus on light and minor ailments. Currently, regardless of condition severity, large doses are commonly used. Pills, powders, soups, and liquids each have their specific suitability. Now, regardless of urgency, decoctions are generally the preferred method. Such occurrences are numerous. Today’s physicians, if not well-versed in the &quot;Materia Medica&quot; and deeply studied the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; while lightly creating their own prescriptions, rarely avoid causing harm.</p>
<p>Someone asked: It is said that Dongyuan&#39;s methods are suitable for the North and Danxi&#39;s methods can be applied in the South. How should this be interpreted? The reply: Dongyuan is a Northern physician, and Luo Qianfu transmitted his teachings, gaining recognition in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Danxi is a Southern physician, and Liu Zonghou carried on his teachings, becoming well-known in Shaanxi. If this were as they say, would it mean that the &quot;Materia Medica&quot; and the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; the teachings of Shen Nong and Huang Di as well as Qi Bo, are only applicable in the North? However, the Five Elements give rise to different diseases, and their treatments require distinct approaches; the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; has already thoroughly discussed these varied methods and the principles of the Five Constants.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br>Just as the north is often cold and the south is often hot, the rivers and lakes are very humid, while Lingnan is prone to miasma. This is attributed to the prevalence of certain climatic influences, resulting in the rise of various diseases in these regions—not because northern diseases lack heat or southern diseases lack cold. Regarding the treatment of cold with heat and heat with cold, the principles are the same across the five directions; how could there be a difference between north and south? However, within human organs, fire occupies two places, while in the six atmospheric influences of heaven, heat accounts for three and a half parts. Therefore, illnesses in the world are characterized by more heat and less cold. This can be seen in the chapter on disease mechanisms in the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; Additionally, the combination of dampness and heat often leads to many diseases. Since the writings of the Grand Minister have fallen into obscurity, the &quot;Jufang&quot; has resorted to the common use of damp-heat remedies. Hence, Danxi emerged to elucidate the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; clarify the biases of the &quot;Jufang,&quot; and discuss the diseases caused by the interplay of dampness and heat to address the inadequacies of previous scholars. Later generations, not understanding this, regarded the frequent use of bitter and cold medicines like qin, lian, zhi, and ye as appropriate for the south, which is a shallow interpretation!<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br><strong>The Three Books of Baizhai</strong></p>
<p><strong>Methods of Treatment - &quot;Suwen&quot;</strong></p>
<p>In treating illnesses, one must understand the natural laws and geographical conditions, as well as the strength and weakness of the person. It is essential to inquire about daily activities, diet, and extreme pleasures or sufferings. For illnesses originating from within, one must first address the internal causes before treating the external symptoms. Conversely, if the illness comes from external factors, one must first treat the exterior before addressing the interior. If internal and external do not interact, then treat the primary ailment. If urgency arises, treat the superficial symptoms; if the situation is more relaxed, treat the root cause first. Address the related causes before the primary ones. To alleviate urgent conditions, supplement the lower ones to control the upper, and for urgent cases below, supplement the upper to control the lower. For severe poisons, treat ten cases with six remedies; for moderate poisons, treat ten cases with seven remedies; for minor poisons, treat ten cases with eight remedies; and for non-toxic conditions, treat ten cases with nine remedies. It is essential to nourish and harmonize, waiting for recovery. These principles are all derived from the &quot;Suwen&quot; text and are essential knowledge for medical practitioners; they cannot be fully recorded here, so I summarize the key points to illustrate their essence.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br><strong>Preface</strong></p>
<p>Medicine is one of the matters of the Confucian scholar, and it is unclear at what point it diverged into two paths. When one’s parents or close relatives fall ill, they entrust their care to others, allowing those without such kinship to take charge of life and death. If there is any mistake, the consequences could last a lifetime. Those who advocate for benevolence to others are unable to apply that same benevolence towards their parents; thus, they fall short in compassion. Friends unite through righteousness, willing to face difficulties, irrespective of the risk—be it water, fire, or warfare; hence, they do not hesitate in urgent matters, regardless of material loss, be it gold, jade, grain, or silk. When one is ill, they might say that they do not understand the ailment; then others claim to thoroughly understand and seek treatment that may not align, each offering conflicting opinions, leading to confusion and inability to discern correctly. They may only be able to address external wounds, yet cannot guide friends through life and death situations; therefore, they lack righteousness. They prioritize personal desires: longing for delicious food, insisting on fine clothing and ornaments, and being careful about offspring and lineage. Yet when sickness arises, they are oblivious, leaving matters to women, relatives, and friends, or to crazed shamans and blind fortune-tellers, and even in dire situations they fail to distinguish between correct and erroneous treatments; thus, they lack knowledge. Among the Five Constants, with three missing, it is imperative for a Confucian to also engage in medicine. Hence it is said: Medicine is one of the matters of the Confucian scholar.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br><strong>The Challenges of Medicine</strong></p>
<p>The Five Classics and Four Books, as well as military and national rites and clothing, if discussed with inconsistencies, are merely matters of conduct. However, when it comes to medicinal herbs and prescriptions, even a slight mistake can endanger life. A ruler of a thousand chariots or a wealthy leader of a hundred pieces of gold should surely think deeply and exercise caution. In the past, when Prince Xu served medicine without tasting it, he was charged with murdering his ruler. When Ji Kangzi offered medicine, Confucius expressed uncertainty, knowing well that medicine should not be taken lightly. During the Jin dynasty, a talented individual wished to revise the &quot;I Ching&quot; and various prescriptions, first discussing and debating the classics with Zunuo. Even with differences, they were not enough to damage moral teachings. However, when it comes to medicine, a minor error can lead to life or death; thus, future generations suffer greatly. How can we treat this lightly?</p>
<p><strong>The Essence of a Healer</strong></p>
<p>Any practitioner of medicine must have a general understanding of both ancient and contemporary knowledge, adhere to benevolence and righteousness, and eliminate the desire for fame and profit. One should dedicate oneself to relief and assistance. If this is achieved, one’s understanding will naturally become clear, and spiritual insights will come forth. Why then be anxious to seek fame and engage in petty profit? If not, how could one avoid the shame of Jiang who was too eager for reputation or of Hua Tuo who, despite his skills, met his demise?<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br><strong>The Physician&#39;s Restraint from Lust</strong></p>
<p>During the Xuanhe period, there was a scholar who suffered from a chronic illness and could not find a cure despite numerous treatments. A man named He Cheng was skilled in medicine. His wife requested to see him, leading him into a private chamber and said, “I have seen my husband suffer for a long time, and we have nearly sold everything we own to pay for his treatments. I am willing to offer myself in exchange.” He Cheng sternly replied, “Madam, why would you speak in such a manner? Please rest assured, I will treat your husband and achieve results; do not tarnish yourself in this way. If there exists no man who would issue punishment, certainly there will be retribution from gods and spirits.” Before long, the husband recovered. One night, He Cheng dreamt he entered a shrine, where a judge spoke to him, saying, “Your medical skills have succeeded. At a time of great urgency, you did not succumb to lust or greed. The Supreme Deity decrees you a reward of fifty thousand coins and a government official post.” A few months later, the Eastern Palace fell ill, and the imperial physicians could not cure it. An edict summoned grassroots doctors, and He Cheng responded, bringing medicine that ensured recovery. The court granted him the same official position and compensation as he had dreamt.</p>
<p><strong>The Hidden Physician</strong></p>
<p>The way of medicine has long existed. The healing of illnesses originates from the Yellow Emperor; discerning the flavors of countless herbs comes from Shen Nong; the concoction of decoctions is attributed to Yi Yin. These three sages alleviated the suffering of the common people and contributed to the nurturing of heaven and earth, thus their contributions to future generations are immensely significant. Among all the ages, those who delve deeply into this path are also disciples of the sages. Jia Yi stated: &quot;The sages of old did not dwell in the court; they must have hidden themselves among physicians and diviners.&quot; Who says there are no heroes among those skilled in techniques?<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br>The art of healing is vast! From the time of Shennong, Huangdi, Qibo, and Leigong, it has been nothing but sages and philosophers opening its sources and wise individuals guiding its flow, thus able to alleviate the sufferings of the common people and support the creation of the heavens and earth. As the world has degraded, the scholars and gentry regard this as merely a skill and disdain it, handing it over to the common people. Therefore, the most subtle and profound principles have emerged from the most humble and base thoughts, resulting in many who cannot heal the sick and instead hasten their demise. This is why Fan Wenzheng declared that if one cannot be a good minister, then one should be a good doctor. Mr. Yichuan stated that entrusting treatment of illnesses to mediocre physicians is tantamount to being unkind and unfilial.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, renowned medical practitioners like He Huan, Bian Que, Chunyu Yi, Zhang Zhongjing, and Sun Zhenren consistently emphasized preservation of health as the priority, with medicine as a supplement. Regarding the observation of symptoms and diagnosis of pulses, they would meticulously discern even the most subtle doubts. It is lamentable that today’s physicians simplify the complexities, treating illness as if it were an enemy to be vanquished, much like strategizing for battle. They merely glimpse the teachings of Hua Tuo, who discusses methods such as dissecting and reconnecting tendons, which are just specialized techniques and not the fundamental principles of the &quot;Shennong Bencao&quot; or classical formulas of established medicinal properties. Today, only Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s works serve as the model for numerous formulas, and scholars should adhere to his teachings.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br>The Continuation of Medical Sayings</p>
<p>Doctors must understand the pulse to recognize illnesses. In ancient times, they only used one medicine to treat a condition; the medicine was pure, and the effect was swift. Nowadays, people do not identify the source of the disease or differentiate pulse patterns, leading to a multitude of medicines—often fifteen or sixteen ingredients—mixed between strengthening and reducing treatments, which makes achieving efficacy difficult. Han Tianjue stated: there is no need for numerous ingredients in a prescription; just look at how simple and convenient Zhang Zhongjing’s formulas are. Danxi mentioned that using medicine is like waging war; more is not necessarily better, as this often leads to confusion.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br>The Value of Adaptability in Medicine</p>
<p>Wang Wenzhong stated: Many disciples of Li Ming are located in Zhongzhou, but only Liu Shouzheng&#39;s teachings are passed on by the Buddhist masters of Jing Mountains. When the master arrived in Jiangnan, he imparted his knowledge to Luo Zhitai of Song, and all the physicians of the South revered it. In the present dynasty, discussions about medicine do not neglect Liu&#39;s teachings. Although Liu and Li&#39;s methods differ in their approach to treatment, both can be reconciled and applied according to the situation and evidence; is there not validity in this? Recently, in Wuzhong, a good physician is identified as one who adheres to Dongyuan, while those who follow Zhang and Liu are labeled as esteemed practitioners. Alas! Yao and Shun acted with humility, while Tang and Wu resorted to warfare; as long as they aligned with the way to benefit the world, what need is there for sameness? I often lament those in the world focused solely on attack and defense, for the evil qi has not retreated while the true qi wanes. Those fixated on nourishment may also cause blockages in the qi path, resulting in considerable harm, where the true qi remains unrestored while the evil qi grows fiercer. The ancients said: Medicine is valuable when it is appropriate, and methods must be adaptable. If one adheres too strictly to the usual, ginseng may inadvertently kill; while understanding change, even Aconite can save lives. The words of Master Sun that one should adjust according to the time and circumstances are indeed wise! The complete compilation of ancient and modern medical literature, volume five hundred and three.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br>General Discussion</p>
<p>Wen Ding Gong&#39;s Family Collection</p>
<p>Monks and Quacks Recklessly Treating Illnesses Leading to Rapid Death</p>
<p>Chen Ruzhong once suffered from a disorder of spleen and stomach due to excessive fire, seeking treatment from Sheng Yongmei. After diagnosing his pulse, he said: &quot;If treated this way, you can live; if treated that way, you will die. This method may lead to a slight prolongation of life, but that method will cause swift death.&quot; However, after starting treatment, Ruzhong&#39;s recovery was slow. Some recommended a monk known for his medical skills, and Ruzhong was swayed by their words, thus seeking treatment from him. He took the monk&#39;s medicine and vomited a liter of blood before dying. Alas! When a physician uses medicine to combat illness, if the illness does not go away but instead leads to death, what is the purpose of medicine? That monk is merely a quack, lacking understanding of medical texts and unable to distinguish the properties of herbs, unable to observe the state of the pulse, ignoring the condition and duration of one&#39;s ailments, and only focusing on toxic substances to attack illness—his methods have likely resulted in many deaths. Now I blame Ruzhong for poorly choosing his physician, which led to his swift demise, and I write this as a caution for those who lightly take medicine.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br>Medical Integration<br>By Fu Zi (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>The Way of Medicine requires both precision and breadth for a clear understanding of its principles. Therefore, the sages of the past established that one must first read Confucian texts to understand the principles of change. Works such as the &quot;Suwen,&quot; &quot;Nanjing,&quot; &quot;Bencao,&quot; and &quot;Mai Jing&quot; should not be overlooked. Why is this so? It is because without the Four Books, one cannot grasp the intricacies of meaning; without the &quot;I Ching,&quot; one cannot comprehend the dynamics of yin and yang; without the &quot;Suwen,&quot; one cannot recognize illnesses; without the &quot;Bencao,&quot; one cannot identify medicines; and without the &quot;Mai Jing,&quot; one cannot diagnose the evidences of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess based on pulse examination. Thus, these texts are indispensable.</p>
<p>Moreover, human life is of utmost importance, and the variations of illness are infinite. There are old and young, differences in constitution, treatments for the five directions, distinctions for the four seasons, and nuances of yin and yang, with the need to discern cold from heat. The internal organs, meridians, qi, and blood should all be categorized properly. The interplay of the six climatic energies and the erratic expressions of the seven emotions, as well as the constant changes in qi, require different approaches and varying urgencies in treatment. Additionally, one must observe characteristics in color and pulse, inquire about daily habits, and understand that although symptoms may be similar, treatments can differ significantly. The sages offer only a glimpse into these matters. Therefore, later scholars must familiarize themselves with the strengths of various texts, integrate what they observe, and apply treatment accordingly, allowing them to be capable practitioners.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br><strong>Collected Works of Jiuling Mountain House</strong><br><strong>Author: Dai Liang of the Yuan Dynasty</strong><br><strong>On the Common Path of Medicine and Confucianism</strong>  </p>
<p>Dai Shuming of Jinhua said: &quot;The practice of medicine is fundamentally about preserving life, which is closely aligned with our Confucian principles. Since the Tang Dynasty, medicine has been classified as a skill, yet we Confucians disdain to engage in it. Those who practice medicine in the world merely recite established doctrines from one school, adhering to fixed methods to merely chance upon a cure for illness. They no longer delve deeply into exploration, seeking the sages&#39; intent to clarify the conjunction of yin and yang and the processes of creation; nor are they able to comprehensively study a myriad of texts, select diverse opinions, and adapt their discourse to changing circumstances in treatment. </p>
<p>Moreover, some go so far as to discard ancient methods, adopting speculative interpretations that lead to confusion, and their missteps are not few. Is this truly in line with the virtuous intent of sages and their compassion for the common people?&quot;<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br>In today&#39;s world, there are those who practice medicine purely for the sake of diagnosis and treatment, but there are few who seek a mentor to learn from. Our ancestors established the Imperial Medical Academy in the inner court and set up schools in the provinces and counties to gather individuals under the name of medicine. This was intended to cultivate talent, test their mastery, and subsequently appoint them to positions of public health responsibility, thereby promoting them to become national physicians, which greatly benefits the people of the world.</p>
<p>Historically, during the Chengzhou era, those regarded as physicians were highly selective and appointed as important officials. The current dynasty also established the foundations of medicine by carefully selecting and assigning upper-level officials to gather and educate all those who practiced medicine. They would study the texts of Xuanqi and refine the techniques of Zhang and Li, ensuring mastery before assigning them to positions. By honing their skills and specializing in their craft, they would effectively manage affairs and determine salaries, thereby eliminating the risk of premature death or illness among the populace, allowing everyone to thrive in health and longevity.</p>
<p>Therefore, medicine is considered one of the essential aspects of governance.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br>The Essentials of Medicine: Eight Key Considerations</p>
<p>There are eight essential points in treating illnesses; if these eight points are not carefully assessed, the illness cannot be cured. If it cannot be cured, there will be no methods available to the physician. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly distinguish these eight points to avoid mistakes. </p>
<p>First is Deficiency, which refers to the five forms of deficiency: a thin pulse, cold skin, low energy, diarrhea, and lack of appetite—these constitute the five deficiencies. </p>
<p>Second is Excess, which refers to the five forms of excess: a strong pulse, hot skin, abdominal distension, blockage in the front and back, and a feeling of fullness—these are the five excesses. </p>
<p>Third is Cold, which indicates the accumulation of cold in the internal organs. </p>
<p>Fourth is Heat, indicating the accumulation of heat in the internal organs. </p>
<p>Fifth is Pathogen, which refers to diseases not associated with the internal organs. </p>
<p>Sixth is Correctness, which implies that it is not an external pathogen that has entered the body. </p>
<p>Seventh is Internal, meaning the illness is not external. </p>
<p>Eighth is External, meaning the illness is not internal. </p>
<p>Once these eight essential points are assessed, they should be compared with the six pulses to determine their origin, and then combined with observation, listening, questioning, and pulse-taking. There should be no illness that cannot be treated!<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br>The use of medicine should not be careless.</p>
<p>Using medicine is like administering punishment; a mistake can lead to life or death. Just as a punishment requires thorough investigation and deliberation before a verdict is given, and a crime is recorded, so must we be meticulous with life, for death cannot be reversed. The same principle applies to medicine. When a physician visits a patient, if they possess the skill to diagnose correctly and understand the relationship between pulse and medicine, then their prescriptions can yield immediate results. However, if a lesser practitioner acts recklessly, applying remedies haphazardly, it can quickly lead to peril. How easy it is to cause harm! This arises from patients&#39; inability to choose their doctors wisely, having never taken care to learn about medical practices beforehand. Is this not a matter for caution?<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br><strong>The Medical Principles of Ancient and Modern Times</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Xu Chunfu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Caution in Illness and Medical Care</strong></p>
<p>The sage treats diseases before they arise, not after they have manifested. This does not mean that one neglects to treat existing illnesses, nor that one is incapable of doing so. It implies that prevention is most effective at the very beginning; by carefully addressing the early signs and guarding against the petty manifestations, one achieves greater success with fewer harms. Only by addressing the subtle beginning does one prevent it from developing into a more serious condition, thereby avoiding any sickness that must be treated later. </p>
<p>People today tend to treat existing illnesses rather than prevent emerging ones, often disregarding early warning signs and waiting for the disease to fully develop before seeking medical help. This neglect of early symptoms leads to more severe conditions, which is clearly evident. The sage’s approach to daily life and actions is meticulous, ensuring proper care at all times. If even minor, obscure ailments arise, they are carefully attended to with preventive measures and treatments. Thus, the sage&#39;s practice of treating ailments before they manifest rather than after is exemplified. </p>
<p>The Analects say: “What the Master is cautious about, are the concerns of battle and illness.” Cheng Yi explains: “Battle concerns the oversight of the divine; sincerity leads to spiritual elevation; illness pertains to matters of life and death; and battle relates to the survival of the nation.”<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>The three cautions are indeed the most significant; however, is it not to be taken with utmost seriousness? When Master Kang was offered medicine, he said he would not dare to taste it until he was fully aware of its effects. This illustrates how the sages carefully consider illness and medicine with great seriousness. </p>
<p>People in the world not only lack knowledge of preventing illness before it arises, but also, when they do fall ill, they are unaware of the need for caution. At the onset of slight ailments, they indulge without restraint, leading to severe problems. Only in desperation do they seek medical help, often recklessly choosing based on rumors or recommendations, entrusting their care to the foolish. As a result, they suffer significant damage due to their previous negligence and lack of reflection on medical treatment. </p>
<p>In urgent situations, one does not have the luxury to carefully select a physician. Little do they realize that medicine is essential for everyone; even the sages are not exempt from illness. However, they have always sought knowledge and have acquainted themselves with well-regarded physicians. When a minor ailment arises, they seek treatment readily, finding cures with ease. </p>
<p>It is akin to remedying a fire hazard before it ignites; how could one suffer from burning if one acts prudently? Danxi has undoubtedly elaborated on this matter. The superficial understanding often leaves much yet to be comprehended. Indeed, the astonishment of the scholar is something that cannot be avoided. </p>
<p>For those keen on cultivating a healthy life, expanding and deepening their understanding may not be without minor benefits.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>The Ancient Medicine&#39;s Fourteen Categories</p>
<p>Among the Fourteen Categories of Ancient Medicine, there was originally a category for the spleen and stomach, which has now been lost. The &quot;Daozang Jing&quot; contains much discussion on this matter. Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, only thirteen categories have been used for evaluating medical practices. These are: the category for wind, followed by the category for external illnesses, then the major pulse category, the minor pulse category, the category for women&#39;s obstetrics, the acupuncture category, the ophthalmology category, the category for throat, mouth, and teeth, the category for sores and ulcers, the orthopedics category, the category for gold and arrows, the category for health preservation, and the category for incantations. In our current dynasty, only thirteen categories have been retained, and the category for the spleen and stomach has never been revived. Li Gao from the Yuan dynasty wrote &quot;On the Spleen and Stomach,&quot; which is notably detailed. However, it does not mention the absence of the fourteen categories—was this due to his own interpretation of ancient texts, or was it purely a new invention that aligned with ancient knowledge? This indeed is a great fortune for the medical path. Upon observing contemporary physicians, many do not specialize in the spleen and stomach; they merely employ methods of opposite treatment, attacking diseases to address superficial symptoms, knowing only to treat heat with cold, cold with heat, obstruction with passage, and passage with obstruction. Using cold because of cold, or heat because of heat, or passage because of passage, or obstruction because of obstruction, must invariably lead to exacerbating the original condition, neglecting its underlying causes, which is the so-called method of following treatment; they seem utterly unaware of this. Moreover, when it leads to damage of the spleen and stomach, they still do not pay attention, and when the vital energy is compromised, many symptoms can arise.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>If the spleen is deficient and the qi is short, leading to an inability to sustain oneself, resulting in what resembles wheezing and panting, physicians still prescribe medicines to descend qi and alleviate wheezing. If the spleen is weak and the defensive qi does not circulate, leading to swelling, physicians still prescribe medicines to deplete qi and promote water metabolism. If the spleen is weak and there is stagnation, resulting in alternating fever and chills, physicians attribute it to external pathogens and use dispersing medicines. In large segments like these, the deficiency merely aggravates the deficiency, leading to the depletion of qi and death; subsequently administering ginseng decoction or aconite decoction after collapse—how can it possibly nurture life?</p>
<p>From what is observed now, those who are insufficient are often the majority, especially since the forces of competition in the pursuit of fame and profit lead to excessive worry, damaging the spleen and causing illness for many. If the body is robust yet is occasionally invaded by wind, cold, summer heat, or dampness, such cases are rarely seen to recover simply through attack. This explains why traditional Chinese medicine can easily lead to success in treatment. However, when encountering the spleen and stomach deficiency causing attacks from wind, cold, summer heat, or dampness, and treating those who have strong bodies, significant variances can arise. If one continues to aggressively treat without cease, they may say that the medicine does not diminish the dizziness, and the disease does not heal. They must take vigorous measures, yet this further injures the spleen and stomach, making the condition worse. When their techniques are exhausted and they feel there is no solution, they say it is difficult to treat. What a great flaw this is; how could one chronicle it all? Ultimately, it is due to a lack of understanding of the root cause.</p>
<p>The classics say: &quot;Those who have grain will thrive; those who lose grain will perish.&quot; It is also said: &quot;Those who have stomach qi live; those who lack stomach qi die.&quot; Therefore, the stomach qi and grain qi, is it not the foundation of the human body?<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>Time Doctors</p>
<p>It is often said: a skilled doctor is not as good as a timely doctor. This means that though a timely doctor may not be well-educated, their ability to seize the moment and adapt can still yield results. They often say: &quot;If you have an illness, come to me while I am in my prime.&quot; They also claim: &quot;Even if you are well-read in the works of Wang Shuhe, you cannot compare to my experience with many cases.&quot; There is a local saying: &quot;The left heart, small intestine, liver, and gallbladder are wise; when the time is right, you can earn a thousand coins a day.&quot; That is why it is said that a skilled doctor is not as good as a timely doctor. The &quot;Treasured Mirror of Health&quot; refers to a fortune doctor, which serves as a serious warning. Nowadays, patients do not understand this principle, entrusting themselves to timely doctors, which is akin to self-destructive behavior, willingly surrendering to decline. What difference is there?<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br><strong>Witch Doctors</strong></p>
<p>Witch doctors replace physicians, hence the term &quot;witch doctor.&quot;<br>According to the &quot;Analects,&quot; a person without constancy cannot be a witch doctor. Confucius laments that one cannot be without constancy, and his reasoning is sound. Zhuzi comments that a witch interacts with spirits, while medicine pertains to matters of life and death. The two are distinct and shouldn&#39;t be equated. The way of medicine originated with Shennong and was elaborated by the Yellow Emperor, who specified certain medicines for certain ailments, reflected in texts like the &quot;Neijing&quot; and &quot;Suwen,&quot; considered the sacred canons for aiding people’s lives; how can this be compared to the practices of witch doctors? However, practitioners of medicine vary in skill; thus, their names differ. Those who are proficient in medicine are called wise doctors, those skilled are good doctors, those preserving the health of the country are national doctors, while those who lack understanding are termed incompetent doctors. Those who beat drums and perform dances to ward off illness are called witch doctors. Therefore, witch doctors, who do not understand the principles of medicine, are referred to as such by those in the South. In modern times, they may be called &quot;Duan Gong Tai Bao,&quot; or &quot;night-walking diviners,&quot; and in the North referred to as &quot;Shi Po.&quot; Though they are all considered to be of dubious character, one still cannot lack constancy, how much less so in other matters?<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br><strong>Famous Physicians</strong></p>
<p>Medicine is entrusted with the mandate of life; it should not be approached with superficial embellishments or fabrications. Thus, a physician should not practice medicine for three generations nor take their own medicine; only by experiencing hardships can one become a good physician. This implies that mastery comes from deep learning. The contemporary practitioners often rely on their renown for fame and profit, failing to dedicate themselves to diligent study. The people in the capital are particularly enamored with empty reputation, disregarding practical knowledge. They rush to offer praise for new theories without ensuring their validity and often do not trust what is newly learned, handing over their lives to hollow names, which is quite regrettable!</p>
<p>Zhi Benzhong said: In the past, the Yue people strategized in support of Duke Lu; strong in resolve but weak in action, they were good at planning but poor at execution. The Zhao and Qi had aspirations that were weak but would assert themselves strongly, lacking in contemplation and suffering from their own stubbornness. They drank medicinal wine to alter the hearts of these two men, transforming them both into celebrated scholars. Observing today’s patients seeking medical help, most prioritize those with timely renown, seldom considering whether the physician has truly studied or understands the pulse. They label them as contemporary, fortunate, or famous physicians, easily elected by the powerful, yielding to treatment even at the cost of their lives, doing so without complaint. Consequently, many physicians hustle for favor with the influential, adopting servile attitudes to seek recommendations, scheming for profit and fame, while knowledgeable individuals mock them. Compassion and moral integrity have been cast aside. How can one expect to drink medicinal wine and change their hearts in such conditions?<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br><strong>The Confucian Healer</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Conggu said: During the Qingli era, there was a successful candidate named Shen Chang, who was known for his integrity and uprightness. He was usually solitary and often attracted the admiration of those who came after him. Yet he never sought recommendations for advancement, and would often sigh, saying: &quot;I am in dire straits, still unable to escape poverty; is this not my fate?&quot; Thus, he entered the capital, seeking a livelihood. </p>
<p>While wandering to the East Huamen, he happened to see several officials mounted on horses, brandishing whips, with their followers being numerous and impressive. He asked a merchant in the market, inquiring about their status. The merchant replied: “They are officials in the Hanlin Academy and medical officers.” Chang sighed again, saying: “I am poor in the teachings of Confucius; how could I not be aware of the likes of licorice and rhubarb?” This marked the beginning of his intention to study medicine.</p>
<p>Next, he saw merchants selling medicinal goods, speaking skillfully yet with difficulty, and he felt ashamed to pursue that path. Unsure and indecisive, he discussed with his peers, saying: “We, who study, may rise or fall based on the written texts; our teachers must seek out distinguished positions, and surely it ought not to be in common paths.” At that time, I was a physician in the imperial medical office; Shen would often send long letters requesting to see me, and I would eagerly receive him, with no one daring to be negligent.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br>It is often said: &quot;Those who come from difficult backgrounds, relying on mutual encouragement, tend to learn medicine. Hearing of your honorable name, I have come to seek guidance.&quot; I replied: &quot;The art of medicine is certainly secondary to the Confucian teachings. However, since it concerns life and death, it is not to be taken lightly. If a learner does not possess a genuine passion and dedication, it is difficult to grasp its subtleties. You have mentioned your difficulties, indicating that your ambitions have not yet been realized; returning to study medicine raises concerns that your stagnation might hinder your ability to delve deeply into it.&quot; He, often with an annoyed expression, said: &quot;Although you are facing hardships, you still follow Confucianism and read the works of Confucius and Mencius, having a basic understanding of the principles of governance throughout history. Now, simply aspiring to learn a technical skill—how can that be a lofty pursuit?&quot; I responded: &quot;I fear that mere superficial engagement will not suffice. You have not yet comprehended the teachings of the ancient Three Sovereigns on medicine, so let us set that aside. Even so, figures such as Zhang Zhongjing of the Han, Ge Hong of the Jin, Chu Cheng of the Qi, and Tao Yinjun of the Liang all practiced Confucianism while possessing talent and virtue. I have heard that the scholar knows rites and righteousness, while the physician understands gain and loss. Without proper cultivation of rituals and righteousness, one becomes ignorant of the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. Failing to distinguish between gain and loss endangers the lives of the people. Can the realms of Confucianism and medicine be treated lightly? Can they be separated?&quot;<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br>Five Difficulties</p>
<p>Song Lian said: Alas! How difficult it is to speak of medicine! The life of a person flows in circulation with the energies of heaven and earth. If one manages to nourish oneself correctly, then harmony prevails and a hundred ailments disappear. If one loses this nourishment, internal injuries arise from the seven emotions, and external afflictions from the six energies, leading to illness. The physician must investigate the root and branches; in essence, he must diminish what is substantive and augment what is deficient. The balance of yin and yang must be preserved, allowing one to adapt to the center. If a crude practitioner is ignorant of this, mixing the substantiated and the vacuous, he will exhaust what is lacking while enhancing what is excessive. Consequently, the ability of illness to arise becomes rare; this constitutes one difficulty. The movement of qi and blood requires specific conduits. The arms and legs, each embodying yin and yang, must balance; if the three yang are insufficient, what of the yangming? It pertains to the principle of two yangs converging in brightness. If yin is excessively diminished, what of the jueyin? It refers to the union of two yins to their fullest extent. When facing illness, it is imperative to know which remedies to apply. While treating may not be difficult, one must also understand the medicinal properties that guide the principles; by following this method, no sickness will be without remedy.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br>Rough practitioners do not distinguish the Twelve Meridians and apply treatments indiscriminately, much like a sparrow caught in the river or fishing in the woods; even if they occasionally succeed, it is sheer luck! This is the second difficulty. The seasonal energies are different each year, and treatments should be accordingly adjusted. When it is time for rising and falling, we should follow and accept their flow; when faced with cold and heat, we should resist and counter them. In doing so, we can preserve the natural harmony and avoid disorder and error. Rough practitioners, however, blindly go against the grain, reversing what should be followed and following what should be resisted, like a blind person lost in the wilderness, unable to discern east from west. This constitutes the third difficulty. Diseases can manifest as hot or cold; heat requires cooling treatments, while cold should be treated with warmth—this is a fundamental principle. Yet, when the forces of cold and heat are intense, attempting to reverse them suddenly will surely clash and create obstacles. Heat must be treated with heat, and cold with cold; their beginnings may be the same, but their ends are different, which may lead to successful outcomes. Rough practitioners, however, fail to observe this and mix treatments indiscriminately. This is the fourth difficulty. Medicinal properties have yin and yang, yet they are not solely categorized as such; there exists yin within yang and yang within yin. A slight deviation can result in a significant error. Rough practitioners neglect to weigh the relative strengths and recklessly apply treatments. This is the fifth difficulty.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br>In a memorial to Emperor Shen-zong of the Song dynasty, Lu Hui states: I originally had no chronic illness, but by chance I encountered a doctor whose techniques were errant. He failed to understand the pulse conditions, the balance of yin and yang, the distinction between root and branch in treatment, and the appropriate order for administering medicine. Recklessly prescribing decoctions and following personal whims, he misdiagnosed and caused calamity to the limbs, endangering the heart and abdomen. While using my personal ailment as an analogy for governance, it underscores the grave errors in medical practice. Should not those who practice medicine take this as a warning?<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br><strong>On Medicine</strong></p>
<p>Yuli Zi said: Governing the world is akin to practicing medicine, is it not? A physician diagnoses by feeling the pulse to understand the symptoms and examines the symptoms to formulate a treatment plan. Symptoms possess yin and yang, vacuity and solidity, while the pulse can be superficial or deep, fine or strong, and the treatment will involve the right balance of tonification and purgation, acupuncture, cautery, and decoctions. The herbs such as ginseng, poria, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and huang, are applied according to the patient&#39;s illness; if appropriately administered, they lead to life, but if not, they result in death. Therefore, to know the symptoms and pulse yet not be adept at formulating treatments, one is not a physician. Even possessing knowledge like Bian Que&#39;s, if one merely boasts without usefulness, without understanding symptoms and pulse, relying on hearsay for treatments, declaring, &quot;I can heal,&quot; is to be a thief of the world. Thus, disorder is equivalent to symptoms; order and structure are like the pulse; morality and laws correspond to treatments and regulations; talent is like medicine. In the governance of the Xia, loyalty was emphasized, while the Yin took advantage of its deficiencies to restore it with substance; the governance of the Yin valued substance, while the Zhou exploited its flaws to restore it with culture. The Qin applied harsh punishments and severe laws to suppress the world, resulting in widespread suffering. Yet, the Han embraced leniency and maintained tranquility, perfectly matching their treatments with symptoms; their medicinal applications seldom failed, ensuring that few ailments remained untreated. Furthermore, one must understand that if the cold at a single finger is not warmed, it will affect the hands and feet, and if the cold at the hands and feet is not warmed, the entire body will suffer, as the energies and pulses are interconnected. A small issue can lead to a significant one; thus, illnesses in people begin at a minor level. Failure to comprehend the fundamental causes, or even understanding yet being confused, ultimately leads to a major issue that cannot be saved, resulting in death. Is this not tragic? Oh! Someone like Yuli Zi can be said to have a profound understanding of the essence of medicine!<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br>Pao Fang Shu</p>
<p>Duke Xuan of Lu wrote the Pao Fang Shu in Zhongzhou to measure the months; it was not merely to avoid disaster but demonstrated that the mind of a noble person applies itself fully in all matters. The esteemed figures of the past were often able to heal, not only in terms of hygiene but also regarding physical ailments, yet people today are ashamed to speak of this. Recently, wealthy families have been collecting and publishing prescriptions, which are widely disseminated, all reflecting the intentions of benevolent individuals. The &quot;Ben Shi Dan Fang&quot; has recently been published in the collections and miscellaneous writings of various gentlemen from the Four Ming dynasty. There are many famous prescriptions that remain unrecorded, and I have often attempted to compile them, lamenting that my collection of books is not extensive. If there are those who can take my words and share them with others, that would also serve as a contribution to helping others.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a></p>
<h3>The Unity of Principles</h3>
<p>   Diseases such as cold damage, internal injury, women’s issues, and children’s ailments are all within the practice of medicine, but they have each become categorized into different schools over the generations. In today’s world, some are labeled as specialists in certain fields, others as having multiple specialties, while some are deemed not to belong to certain fields. They are unaware that in ancient times, there was a physician named Bian Que who traveled past Handan and became known as a female physician when he encountered noble women; he passed by Suiyang and became known as a doctor for the elderly when he heard of the Zhou people&#39;s affection for older adults; he entered Xiangyang and became a pediatrician upon learning of the Qin people’s love for children. He adapted to societal norms without distinguishing differences in the treatment of illnesses. When it comes to medicine, all is interconnected by the same principles. To say that one is strong in one area and weak in another also indicates a lack of thorough understanding of these principles.</p>
<h3>The Goodness of Acupuncture, Moxibustion, and Medicine</h3>
<p>   Bian Que remarked that diseases are limited to the area affected by the skin and muscle, or those that penetrate the blood vessels and tissues, or involve the stomach and intestines. Therefore, one must integrate acupuncture, moxibustion, and medicine in order to genuinely engage in the healing arts. Engaging in true medical practice requires a comprehensive understanding akin to that of a well-rounded official in the Zhou dynasty. In the past, the fallacy was to restrict the art of saving lives solely to medication, thus neglecting acupuncture and moxibustion. Whenever faced with diseases like cold damage that penetrate into the blood chamber, or injuries from impact, which cannot be cured by medicinal pills, one might find themselves at a loss without the intervention of acupuncture, feeling inadequate in skill. It was realized that treating illness is much like a strategic confrontation, where offense and defense must align with the characteristics of the enemy, revealing the true benefits of acupuncture, moxibustion, and medicine in relation to the illness at hand.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br>             Report on the Incompetent Doctor</p>
<pre><code>The essence of medicine lies in specialization; without it, the harm done is not trivial. Occasionally, there are ignorant individuals who misappropriate the name of medicine, copying established prescriptions and barely noting the &quot;Nanjing&quot; and &quot;Pulse Scripture,&quot; believing that medicine holds no difficulties. Apart from this, they merely groom their appearance, adorn themselves in fine clothes, practice empty rhetoric, flatter the wealthy, and thus gain hollow praise, becoming self-satisfied and ostentatious. When faced with those who truly understand, they become restless and unable to apply their tricks, yet they continue to flatter while slandering others behind their backs. They ridicule their peers who study and seek knowledge, tiring themselves in vain. Whenever they attempt treatments, they act irrationally, haphazardly dispensing medicines, occasionally finding fleeting success, but invariably demanding excessive compensation. If any harm results, they claim to have done their best. It is common for many to adopt this approach and claim that medicine is simple; is that really the case? Alas! Daily, the practice of medicine is descending into error, and it is no wonder that the learned gentlemen are so shallow.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a>
</code></pre>
<p>It is rare to find a true doctor who is genuinely effective. Fortunately, the way of heaven promotes life and detests killing, promptly revealing the consequences of one&#39;s actions, while incompetent doctors unjustly perish, witnessed by all. Recently, there was a scholar who was fatally harmed by a mistake in medication; his family sued, and the legal authorities apprehended and interrogated, but the punishment was merely a beating, and he was released to return home. Within a year, he was brutally murdered by robbers. Is this not a manifestation of heaven’s retribution? A poem mocking incompetent doctors suggests: &quot;Who knows the impostors, while the virtuous remain blind to the truth? If incompetent doctors don&#39;t perish early, they could ruin countless lives.&quot; Is this not a sign of heavenly disdain for them? Therefore, I urge my students to understand that medicine is a profound way of nature, linked to life and death. Professionals must diligently study to reach the highest standards. One should not think it easy to deceive others or rely solely on luck. If one masters their craft, there will undoubtedly be those who recognize the effort. Those who do not seek to profit at the expense of others will find their integrity within themselves. As the &quot;I Ching&quot; says: &quot;Good and evil accumulate, with misfortune and fortune coming in kind.&quot; How can one say there is no consequence?<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br>The practice of medicine, when not profound, leads to premature death.</p>
<p>What people in the world value most is life; the means to sustain life is medicine, and the foundation of medicine lies in its principles. In ancient times, figures like the Yellow Emperor, Qi Bo, Bian Que, and Hua Tuo mastered the art of reviving the dead and restoring consciousness, carrying these skills down through the three dynasties. However, those who study these arts today are often superficial and lack thorough understanding. Consequently, there are those who mislead others. Why is this so? It is because they interpret the yin with yang, and the yang with yin; they push the void with the solid, and measure the solid with the void; they consider the external in relation to the internal, and the internal in relation to the external; they assess urgency with slowness, and slowness with urgency; they advance with a retreating eye, and probe forward with a retreating stance. </p>
<p>They are reckless in diagnosing pulses, shallow in observing symptoms, confused in judging sounds, and hazy in assessing colors. This leads to a reversal of techniques that blind and confuse, misapplying remedies to the deaf and blind. They cut short lives yet to blossom, and extinguish souls that should thrive. Such practitioners send lives into this world burdened and return them to the grave in torment. Indeed, premature death in the world is common. Alas! The purpose of medicine is to save lives; a lack of mastery leads instead to their demise.<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br><strong>Method of Using Medicines</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to the method of using medicines, one must not rigidly adhere to ancient formulas. Instead, adjustments should be made based on the severity of symptoms, modifying the ingredients according to the varying properties of heat and cold to ensure they align with the principles of treatment. One must not apply recklessly; misguidedly administering pills or powders can, in an instant, harm or endanger life. Is there not a natural order that physicians must heed carefully? Substances like realgar, chaulmoogra, quartz, borax, and cinnabar must not be fire-cooked. Herbs such as Sichuan pepper, aconite, turmeric, southern star, and pinellia should not be used raw; they must be processed diligently according to proper methods for medicines to be effective.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Luo Qianfu stated: A child, during the fifth month, suffered abdominal pain after consuming cold powder. He subsequently purchased Shenqi Pills from a pharmacy, which led to an increase in cold pain around the navel and abdomen, intermittently for seven to eight years without relief. Reflecting on the ancients&#39; saying, &quot;Cold should be treated with heat,&quot; one must adhere to established principles; a competent physician cannot abandon their essential guidelines to change methods. The harmful substance was cold, and the medicine used was also cold; heavy cold injures the stomach, which explains the cold pain. The human spleen and stomach prefer warmth and reject cold, particularly for children whose vital energy and blood are still weak and cannot tolerate cold. Thus, the yang energy becomes dormant, and cold toxins linger, remaining unresolved over time. To treat illness, one must first address the root cause, using medicines that harmonize and nourish the vital energy to rectify earlier mistakes; only after one month of such treatment can recovery be expected.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br>Alas! When Kang Zi offered medicine, Confucius bowed and accepted it, and due to his lack of understanding, he did not dare to taste it; this is the essence of preserving life. How is it that ordinary people merely sit silently and pulse-check, claiming to know the illness? The pulse is the blood and energy of a person flowing between the meridians; if heat prevails, the pulse is rapid; if cold prevails, the pulse is slow; when it is robust, it indicates strength; when it is weak, it indicates deficiency. As for what is injured, how can one distinguish its form? Physicians must thoroughly examine the source of illness, and the patient must also disclose the source of their ailment. Yet this man&#39;s father did not inform the doctor of the illness&#39; source and sought medicine from the marketplace, while the dispenser of medicine also failed to assess the condition, resulting in a sickness lasting seven or eight years, all missing this principle. The real master Sun said: “Inquiring before diagnosis is most accurate.” Dongpo said: “One should just seek to recover from illness and not burden the physician.” The words of these two gentlemen greatly benefit the world.</p>
<p>Entry to the Study of Medicine<br>【Ming Dynasty – Li Chen】</p>
<p>Standards for Practicing Medicine</p>
<p>The practice of medicine involves human life; it must be genuine and unpretentious, characterized by calmness and constancy, possessing true knowledge of the nuances of Yin and virtue. One cannot recklessly pursue the study of medicine. Once the resolve is established, then one may deliberate on the application of efforts. Every morning, sit quietly facing the diagram of the primordial, studying the &quot;Classic of Filial Piety,&quot; &quot;Analects,&quot; and &quot;Elementary Learning&quot;; those with substantial resources should also study all the Four Books, the ancient texts of the I Ching, the &quot;Classic of Documents,&quot; &quot;Great Plan,&quot; &quot;Unfettered,&quot; and the &quot;Classic of Yao.&quot; Grasp the general meaning without the need for forced memorization.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br>Indeed, the practice of medicine originates from Confucianism. Without studying and understanding principles, one remains ignorant and unable to grasp the complexities of change. Every noon, upon entering, one should read aloud from the beginning to the end, methodically, ensuring that no word is missed, as if it flows from the mouth. </p>
<p>If one desires to specialize in minor subjects, it is also essential to study major subjects; if one wishes to focus on surgery, one must not neglect internal medicine. Understanding one requires knowledge of the other; there has never been a case of mastering one while ignoring the other. It is precisely due to the varied levels of depth and familiarity that there are divisions in specialties. </p>
<p>After thorough reading, one should contemplate quietly, investigating the meanings within. If there are doubts or difficulties, one should consult ancient and modern renowned texts to broaden one’s knowledge. Alternatively, seeking advice from virtuous and wise individuals is advisable. Tao Jie&#39;an stated: &quot;Just do not engage in conversation with the ignorant.&quot; This is because formulas and remedies do not stray from the “Ben Cao,” “Su,” and “Nan,” as well as works by Zhang, Liu, Li, and Zhu. Even if there are minor treatments and quick methods, they are ultimately not the work of the masters, and one must be cautious to avoid being misled by them.</p>
<p>Once the fundamental texts have been thoroughly comprehended, one can then qualify as a minor physician. With greater dedication to quiet meditation, one should revisit Confucian texts, gaining a basic understanding of the dynamics of yin and yang, learning from both close relations and distant ones, thus preparing to offer assistance effectively in various situations. </p>
<p>Particularly in one’s conduct, it is crucial to establish consistent guidelines. Each dawn, one should purify the heart through quiet meditation and rise early to engage with Confucian texts, in order to refresh the source of one’s heart. </p>
<p>At all times, one should not lose the vitality of early morning, which is wondrous.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br>When examining a patient, one must first inquire about the onset of symptoms and the date they began. From head to toe, one should reference the initial signs of typhoid fever, mixed symptoms, and methods of distinguishing internal and external injuries, questioning each detail thoroughly. If the symptoms are severe but clearly categorized, one need not check the pulse and can discuss treatment options. If the symptoms are mild yet not clearly defined, pulse examination is necessary for careful assessment.</p>
<p>For men, the left side is examined first, followed by the right; for women, the right side is examined first, followed by the left, in accordance with the principles of yin and yang. First, assess each channel individually to understand the hidden curves. Then, take a comprehensive look to determine the state of deficiency or excess, life or death. After the diagnosis, any remarks about the patient&#39;s condition must be truthful, whether they indicate excess or deficiency, and one should clarify the treatability and difficulty of the case, sharing the details of symptoms to evaluate one’s own state of mind. If there are aspects that were overlooked, they should be openly clarified without embellishment.</p>
<p>It is crucial to remain calm and consider the options carefully, avoiding hasty or intense actions that may lead to fear. When examining women, it is essential to first consult their close relatives about the symptoms, appearance, and dietary habits; then, proceed according to convenience. For severe cases, one may conduct the examination from a bedside screen, while in less severe cases, examine at the door behind a curtain, always ensuring to cover one&#39;s hands with a thin gauze. </p>
<p>In cases involving poor families, the physician should provide their own thin gauze.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br>Widows and unmarried women should be even more respectful and careful, as this is not a trivial matter. When discussing illness, one must clearly analyze and discern whether it is an internal injury or an external affliction; whether it pertains to miscellaneous diseases, or whether it shows signs of Yin deficiency; whether it is primarily an internal injury with some external influence, or primarily an external affliction with some internal injury. Discussing prescriptions should be based on the pulse, following what has been established and avoiding any secrecy. </p>
<p>According to ancient methods, one should adjust based on the patient&#39;s age, the circumstances of their situation, and whether they have taken any medications before. Women experience menstrual cycles and childbirth, while men deal with the labor and leisure of sexual activity. </p>
<p>Although based on ancient wisdom, one should not be bound by it. Understanding the organs and functions leads to certainty and prevents misjudgment. Care must be taken when administering medicine. For any specific condition, designate one herb as the sovereign, another as the minister, and others as assistants. </p>
<p>All treatment should stem from qualified practitioners; certainly, the application and formulation of medicines must align with established practices, especially in urgent situations — how can those suffering from ailments manage this themselves? If someone insists on self-administering remedies, their intentions should be respected, but they must adhere to the classical methods of preparation without risking the efficacy of the medicine through clever tricks. Should the pathological conditions remain somewhat unclear, and if the medicine does not yield strong results, it is advisable to wait quietly and reflect deeply on the underlying causes, then reassess and adjust the prescription; recovery is assured. </p>
<p>Once the illness is treated, that remains the task of the physician. Even while adhering to simplicity, when using this to sustain one’s livelihood, one should not overly demand compensation but should accept what is offered. If a patient is extremely poor and does not provide anything, it particularly demonstrates the physician’s compassion and integrity.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br>If a person cannot repay, then heaven will repay them. Thus, with a steadfast heart, is there a technique that is unclear or ineffective? Someone asked about the essence of a single word, and the answer was: merely to not deceive. One who reads medical books but does not go through them from beginning to end, only partially understanding one method or another, is deceiving themselves; one who reads thoroughly but does not comprehend or integrate the knowledge is also deceiving themselves; one who understands but does not rise early to calmly sit and regulate their breath, thinking this suffices for diagnosis, is deceiving themselves; one who diagnoses a pulse but does not accurately convey the truth is deceiving themselves; one who discusses prescriptions and medications carelessly and without detail is deceiving themselves; one who hopes for gain after recovery, yet remains entangled in worldly ways, is deceiving themselves. </p>
<p>It is not the lack of profit that is concerning with a physician, but rather the lack of clarity. Repeatedly using methods that yield results while gaining understanding, yet not compiling this knowledge to repay heaven and earth for the public good, is also deceitful. Deceit clouds one&#39;s conscience and causes the medical way to ultimately fail; honesty, on the other hand, allows for the cultivation of one’s moral sense and the flourishing of medicinal practices. The distinction between honesty and deceit is beyond human manipulation.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br><strong>Ten Essentials for Medical Practitioners</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Maintain a compassionate heart, which is the best advice; generously help the masses, and your kindness will be profound.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Understand Confucian and Daoist principles, as they are treasures in the world of medicine; clarity in reasoning is valuable, and one must study various texts thoroughly.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Differentiate between emotional and physical conditions; when your understanding is clear, even chronic illnesses can be addressed.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Recognize the origins of diseases; only when a doctor can confidently discuss these matters can they truly be considered specialized.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Understand the flow of Qi to comprehend seasonal changes; adapt treatments of warming or cooling according to the time.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Be familiar with the meridians, and correctly identify diseases; like the famous physician Bian Que, have a complete understanding of internal organs.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Know the properties of medicines and tailor prescriptions to diseases; failing to distinguish between warming and cooling might harm patients with specific conditions.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Master the preparation of medicines, paying attention to the correct heat; too much or too little can determine safety and risk.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not be jealous or let personal preferences influence you; the principles of nature are evident, so quickly repent of such thoughts.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not prioritize profit; instead, uphold righteousness and benevolence; regardless of wealth or poverty, the use of medicine should be equitable.<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br>Ten Essentials for the Ill</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose a capable physician; it benefits the illness. One must be cautious, as life and death are at stake.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>Be willing to take medicine; many ailments can be dispelled. There are foolish people who resist treatment themselves.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek early treatment; it is easier at the outset. If one is not careful in frosty conditions, hard ice will suddenly arrive.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid empty rooms; naturally, illness will not arise. If one violates this, even the best doctor cannot help.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid anger; self-reflection is necessary. Anger ignites like fire, making rescue difficult.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Cease idle thoughts; one must rest in tranquility. When worries are cleared, the spirit naturally rejuvenates.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Regulate diet and nutrition; there must be principles. Excess damages the spirit; overeating is hard to manage.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Be careful with daily routines and social interactions; even minor labor can deplete vital energy.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not trust the misguided; believing them leads to trouble. Heretical notions and deceptions disturb families.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not be frugal with expenses; what does saving mean in this context? I ask you, is life or wealth more precious?<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br><strong>Doctors and Patients Share Common Ills</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>In the south, when a person is ill, they often invite a doctor to their home. After the examination, the doctor simply prescribes a remedy and instructs someone to purchase the medicine from the market, without regard for the authenticity or preparation of the medicine, which they then take without question. They do not show reverence, nor do they reflect on their own faults, but only blame the doctor for incompetence. The next day, they simply switch doctors, and this continues for several days, resulting in an increase in symptoms, while the doctors themselves are confused and do not understand the cause. Alas! Is this the fault of the patients? Or the ignorance of the doctors?</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the north, when a person is ill, they invite a doctor to their home, and regardless of the severity of the illness, they hand over a sum of money and request a prescription. They expect immediate results; if not, they quickly seek out another doctor, changing their minds as easily as switching allegiances. They do not realize that each person has their own unique constitution and that illnesses vary in depth and severity.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br>The affliction of cold and its symptoms can be cured with one or two doses; however, as for injuries and ailments from exhaustion, can they be cured with just a dose or two? This is a common misunderstanding, and many are misled by it; only the wise can discern!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Firstly, the path of medicine, which was once called the way of immortals, is fundamentally about preserving life. Many modern physicians do not understand this meaning; they often focus on the wealthy while neglecting the poor. This is a habitual sentiment among doctors and is hardly a compassionate practice. In my view, medicine concerns life and death, and the responsibility is grave. How can one discriminate based on wealth? Those who claim to be my peers should regard the virtue of cherishing life highly and should be careful not to discuss wealth, as all are living beings; this too is a hidden merit.</p>
<p>Secondly, when a patient seeks medical aid, they are entrusting their life and death; thus, they ought to be respected. One should not treat them lightly; wealth should not be a factor in assessing their situation. One ought to sincerely dedicate oneself, for any slight disrespect would imply a disregard for life itself.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br>Moreover, there are even more despicable traitors, who, having the power of medicine, upon recovering from illness, seek financial gain with false claims of blessings received yesterday. They exchange medicine for another’s wealth, and do not give credit to anyone. Alas! They cannot reap benefits nor gain reputation; such individuals are truly devoid of compassion.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is often seen in contemporary times that when people seek medical treatment, they are instructed to lie in dark rooms behind curtains, without being informed of their afflictions. They simply allow pulse-taking, and many women are not even seen. How can they perceive their own condition? Furthermore, they cover their hands with silk cloths, making it inconvenient for the physician to inquire. Even if they do ask, the patients do not disclose the truth; this is not a desire for recovery but rather a means of complicating the treatment.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br>Little do they know that even the divine physicians of old relied on observing, listening, asking, and palpating; none of these four can be neglected. How can today&#39;s doctors, who may not be as remarkable as those of the past, expect to thoroughly comprehend the viscera by merely feeling the pulse? I write this to inform patients of the world: when a doctor is called to your home, explain your ailments in detail. If the physician then examines your pulse and understands your condition without doubt, the prescribed medicine will surely be effective.</p>
<p>In the past, Dongpo said: &quot;I seek to cure my illness; how can I be a burden to the doctor?&quot; </p>
<p>Firstly, among those in my field, there are individuals without virtue who only boast of their own strengths and expose the weaknesses of others. When they visit a patient, they do not inquire about the illness but instead criticize the previous doctor&#39;s mistakes to frighten the patient. Even if the previous physician&#39;s medicines were entirely appropriate, what more could one seek? Just because there may have been a temporary oversight that failed to produce results, one cannot generalize that the previous medicine was inept. Medicine is fundamentally a compassionate practice, and since sharing and passing down knowledge is part of this continuum, colleagues must protect and support one another despite minor differences. They should avoid slandering each other, as this reflects a lack of loyalty and integrity. Beware, beware!<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br><strong>Five Precepts and Ten Essentials of Medical Practitioners</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>First Precept</strong>: Regardless of the patient&#39;s size, wealth, or status, if someone seeks your help, do not delay or dismiss them. If you wish to go but do not, it is not easy; do not consider the cost of medicine lightly. You should do your best with each case, and naturally, your reputation will grow, without harming your conscience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Second Precept</strong>: When examining women, widows, or nuns, always wait for an attendant to be present before entering the room for diagnosis. If there is no companion, do not examine them alone. If there are inconvenient issues at hand, you should earnestly observe, but even to close relatives, do not speak of it, due to the nature of the domestic environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Third Precept</strong>: Do not accept precious gifts or items from patients as a means of barter. If it is truly necessary, have them prepare it themselves. If the treatment does not work, there will be no suspicion of blame. Moreover, do not praise the quality of their possessions; such behavior is unworthy of a gentleman.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fourth Precept</strong>: As someone who saves lives, do not engage in leisure activities like climbing mountains, carrying wine, or traveling for pleasure. Additionally, do not leave your home at inappropriate times.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br>Whenever someone arrives with an illness, one must personally examine them, carefully prepare the medicine, and write the prescription according to the texts. One must not fabricate prescriptions or be subject to questioning by others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The five prohibitions: As for courtesans and private practitioners requesting to see patients, one should treat them as one would the children of respectable families, refraining from inappropriate remarks to derive improper benefits, and upon completing the consultation, they should leave. For the impoverished, the cost of medicine may be returned, but one should only dispense medicine and not allow further visits, to avoid temptations of immorality.</p>
<p>First imperative: One must first understand Confucian principles to then grasp medical theories, whether internal or external. It is essential to diligently read the ancient texts of distinguished medical theories, never letting go of them day or night, and to consult each one thoroughly, absorbing the intricate changes, imprinting them in the heart, and discerning them with the eyes so that one will not err when diagnosing patients.</p>
<p>Second imperative: When selecting and purchasing medicines, one must strictly adhere to the methods of Lei Gong (the Thunder God). Medicines should be prepared according to established prescriptions, while some may be adjusted according to the illness as needed. Decoctions and powders should be readily prepared, while pills must be made in advance. Medicines become more effective with age, and those that age well will differ in nature. One should not be stingy with valuable medicines; in the end, they will surely bring benefit.</p>
<p>Third imperative: Among fellow practitioners in the countryside, one must not harbor feelings of contempt or arrogance; it is crucial to remain humble and cautious.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br>Respect for elders fosters deference among students and humility among the proud, while those who fall short benefit from recommendations. In this way, there are no slanders or grievances, and trust is cherished.</p>
<p>Four essentials: Managing a household is akin to treating illness. When people neglect their vital energy and overindulge, numerous ailments arise; mildly, their bodies become weak, severely, they risk death. If a household lacks a solid foundation and indulges in luxury, expenses become excessive; mildly, there are no savings, severely, there is poverty and distress.</p>
<p>Five essentials: Humans receive their mandate from heaven and must not go against it. Those who seek to advance must understand if intentions align with heaven’s will, recognizing what is in accordance with or against nature. When one acts in accordance, relationships flourish; when one acts against, descendants face misfortune. Why not lightly pursue profit and avoid long-term harm, as a precaution against repercussions?</p>
<p>Six essentials: In local relationships with friends and relatives, apart from weddings, funerals, sickness, and congratulations, other household matters including exchanges and gifts should not seek extravagance or rivalry. Meals should consist of one fish and one vegetable: this not only saves expenses but also cherishes resources, implying that frugality is preferable to excessive seeking.<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br><strong>Seven Essentials:</strong> For those from poor families and traveling monks, when they come for treatment, do not ask them for payment for medicine; simply consider it as providing medicine. If others also encounter poverty, offer small tokens of help according to your ability, as this is the true practice of benevolent medicine. Otherwise, those with medicine but without firewood or food may find their lives difficult to preserve.</p>
<p><strong>Eight Essentials:</strong> For all that one possesses, regardless of its size, it is necessary to invest in property as a foundation. Do not purchase trivial items or non-essential objects that waste money. Additionally, do not hold gatherings for silver or alcohol, as this is detrimental to business. This should be strictly prohibited in order to eliminate gossip and resentment.</p>
<p><strong>Nine Essentials:</strong> All items used in the household should be well-prepared and organized, with nothing lacking at the last moment. Furthermore, one should seek out ancient and modern respected texts, as well as recently published medical terms and theories, to enhance knowledge. This is indeed the fundamental duty of a physician.</p>
<p><strong>Ten Essentials:</strong> Whenever requested by an official office, one must be prompt in response and not delay. It is important to maintain sincerity and respect, clearly state the source of the illness, and prescribe appropriate medicines. After recovery, one should not seek gifts or speak of personal matters, as this may lead to fault or crime. Avoid unnecessary interaction with the government; one should naturally abide by the law.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Children&#39;s Health</strong></p>
<p>In the practice of medicine, one must first rectify oneself, and then address the ailments of others. To rectify oneself means to understand principles and fully utilize techniques. To rectify others means to accurately apply remedies to cure diseases. Only then will success be assured. If one cannot rectify oneself, how can one rectify others? If one cannot rectify others, how can one cure diseases? This is mentioned at the beginning to encourage learners.</p>
<p>As for those who practice medicine, they should possess a warm and gentle temperament, remain humble in aspirations, observe etiquette in actions, and be harmonious and gentle in demeanor, without self-aggrandizement or pretentiousness. They should broadly gather medicinal knowledge, deeply understand principles, be clear about the movements of Qi, grasp yin and yang, skillfully diagnose through pulse and sight, distinguish between truth and falsehood, differentiate cold and heat, examine root and branch, and identify severity and lightness. Minor illnesses should not be treated as major, and easy matters should not be neglected for difficult ones. The attention to detail should be the same for the poor and rich alike; there should be no distinction in the usage of medicines between nobility and commoners. If one can do so, they are close to the true path. Conversely, failing to do so makes one a great bane to living beings.</p>
<p>When a physician is summoned, they should not discriminate by status or distance, and must attend indiscriminately. Upon arriving at the home, they should first inquire whether medical help has been previously sought, and what medicines were administered. If there has been treatment already, then one can discern the truth of the situation. Furthermore, when treating children, one must be aware of the distinct characteristics based on geographical differences and must carefully consider the varying temperatures of the locality; treatments should not be uniform, as the ancients were particularly cautious in this regard.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br><strong>Essential Readings in Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Li Zhongzi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Not Losing Human Feelings</strong>  </p>
<p>I once read the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; and came across the discussion on the variations of treatments, which concludes with the phrase: &quot;Not losing human feelings.&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but be struck by it, sighing deeply at how profound this understanding is for practitioners. The notion of not losing human feelings is something that physicians must urgently consider, yet it proves to be quite difficult. Generally, human feelings can be categorized into three types: the feelings of the patient, the feelings of others, and the feelings of the physician.  </p>
<p>The so-called feelings of the patient are characterized by the distinct conditions of the five organs and the varying responses of the seven emotions. Yang organs require coolness, whereas Yin organs require warmth. Those who can tolerate toxins may find mild treatments ineffective, while those who cannot tolerate them may suffer harm from strong treatments; this reflects the differences in the energies of the organs. Each person&#39;s preferences and aversions vary with activity and rest, as well as with food and drink. Those who are inclined to good fortune often dismiss warnings, while those who are more anxious may find comfort in false reassurances. For the untrusting, sincere advice is hard to accept, and those who are skeptical may reject deeper insights out of caution.  </p>
<p>Moreover, the wealthy often indulge their desires and disregard restrictions, while the noble may act with pride and defy reason; these depict the differences in social interactions. The poor struggle to meet basic needs, making it difficult to consider medicine and remedies. The lowly labor excessively with little remedy, and their burdens are evident; these illustrate the variations in treatment approaches.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br>There are sound words that, once believed, can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations—many paths lead to losing one’s way, ultimately resulting in empty promises; this is the harm of lack of guidance. Some are overly cautious, seeking only safety, but with limited resources, they inevitably face failure; this is the harm of excessive caution. There are circumstances that do not align, leading to unfulfilled desires, deep emotional ties, and even the best remedies may be ineffective; this is the harm of gains and losses. Some act too hastily and face delayed ailments, complicating their treatment; others are too slow and encounter urgent problems, leading to a situation that is hard to rectify; this is the harm of haste and delay. Some fear the remedies due to their bitter taste, leading to mental blockages; others fear aggressive treatments, causing their spirit to become unsettled; this is the harm of the mind. Some avoid discussing their ailments, harbor hidden troubles, and even conceal symptoms, merely relying on pulse diagnosis without understanding that since ancient times, wise figures have never depended solely on pulse without considering other symptoms; for instance, if the pulse shows fullness, one knows it could be due to food damage, but the exact time and nature of the injury cannot be discerned solely through the pulse. These are emotional aspects of patients, which must not be overlooked. </p>
<p>As for the feelings of others: some may adhere to opinions grounded in evidence, while the illness may not correspond; others may speak without basis, and the medical principles have never actually appeared in dreams.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br>Some manipulate the truth, siding with those who agree with them and denying those who do not, making it difficult to discern true from false; some cling to shallow views, treating headaches with head remedies and foot pain with foot remedies, but who can distinguish what is fundamental? Some hold on to prestigious opinions that are hard to counter, while others have biases that are hard to correct. It is like recommending a doctor on matters of life and death, where some recommend out of personal affection, others for superficial effects, some trust their reputation, and others for greedy rewards. Even when they are confused, they carelessly critique; if praised, someone like Zhi can become Shun, while if criticized, a phoenix can become an owl. This leads to talented individuals withdrawing, leaving serious illnesses to wait for demise. These are all human sentiments that ought to be scrutinized.</p>
<p>As for the emotions involved in healing: some use crafty language to deceive, some sweeten their words to please, others argue passionately to mislead, and some use alarmist speech to intimidate—these belong to the deceitful category. Some build connections with acquaintances, some improve relations with servants, some seek recommendations, and some show up uninvited—these belong to the sycophants. There are those who express empty ideas without substance, making claims of divine inspiration while being illiterate, pretending to possess secret teachings—these are the frauds. Others observe and inquire without real concern, gathering what they can without thought and mistakenly believing that they are wise while others are foolish—these are the reckless.<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br>There exists a jealousy that leads to exclusion, where the sun may share a common heart while the shadows permeate; right and wrong are reversed, and distinctions are blurred. This is the flow of slander and jealousy. There are those who are greedy and ignorant, dismissing human life lightly; when illness is precarious, even a good doctor cannot be certain. Despite thorough care, there is still hope for recovery, yet the greedy, in their eagerness for achievement, irresponsibly administer treatments that lead to ruin, thus spreading slander to disguise their failures. This is the flow of greed and fortune. </p>
<p>There are opinions held individually, leading to indecision over similarities and differences. Those who aspire to high ideals often have few allies, while those who strive for lofty paths frequently face slander. How much can be collectively shared, and how easily can disturbances arise from many voices? This is the flow of superficiality. </p>
<p>Some, who are longtime acquaintances, work opportunistically for gain; others, who are strangers, engage in ad hoc debates. If the patient does not recognize the physician, they hastily seek financial help, while physicians, unwilling to bear grudges, can only rely on superficial remedies. Some engage many doctors, watching each other; others, with vested interests, avoid suspicion. They only seek to avoid blame; indeed, they may succeed. But who is to blame for missing opportunities? This results from a lack of true understanding of the physician and reliance on unqualified doctors.</p>
<p>In all these cases, is there not a depth to human emotions? Yet, the complexities of human sentiment are too numerous to exhaust fully. The sage warns against losing sight of human feelings, urging learners to reflect and be cautious, lest they fall into bad habits. Nevertheless, to avoid loss is not without its compromises. Compromises may exacerbate the illness, while not compromising can strain human relations. There are inevitable conditions where one must compromise on illness, and yet there are also unavoidable social dynamics that require concessions. How, then, can one navigate this? Hence it is said: “How difficult it is!”<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br><strong>A Discussion on the Conduct of Healing: Straight in Action, Round in Wisdom, Small in Heart, and Great in Courage</strong></p>
<p>Sun Simiao&#39;s advice to physicians states: &quot;Actions should be straight, and wisdom should be round; the heart should be small, but the courage should be great.&quot; Truly! The essence of medical skill resides in this. Maintain a sincere and cautious heart, act with tranquility and harmony, speak without frivolous words, observe without chaotic gazes, avoid letting unwholesome thoughts arise, never give in to greed, be not dismissive of poverty, do not shy away from fatigue, diligently examine medical texts, and seek to understand suffering with compassion. Such practice is called &quot;straight in action.&quot; </p>
<p>Understand that talents vary in depth, ages differ in youth and old age, body types range from fat to thin, temperaments can be slow or quick, circumstances can be rich or poor, social climates may be gentle or strong, climatic conditions shift between cold and heat, day and night have their light and heavy moments, appearances reflect good or ill fortune, voices have their highs and lows, illnesses may be longstanding or new, and life circumstances may be excessive or deficient. Knowing the constant and the variable, possessing spirit and clarity, such qualities are referred to as &quot;round in wisdom.&quot;<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br>The principles of observation, listening, questioning, and examining should be thorough. One must distinguish between tonifying and purging, and recognize the variations of cold and heat. Life is incredibly precious, and the consequences of error are inescapable; if one makes a mistake, there can be no atonement, no matter how long one may seek it. How can one afford to be careless? Such is called a little heart. To tonify is to tonify, and to purge is to purge; heat is heat, and cold is cold. Use appropriate methods according to the situation, apply recovery techniques, and administrate ginger in moderation. Constantly strive to restore life; analyze principles thoroughly and avoid indecision. Those who can act thus are called bold. The four aspects may seem separate but are fundamentally connected.</p>
<p>In the world, there has not been a meticulous scholar who uses established methods to harm others, nor a resourceful person who damages their reputation and integrity for personal loss. Those who are skilled in treatments will have complete wisdom. A little heart fears mistakes, while a bold heart understands the diagnosis of medicines. Sometimes, a powerful remedy or a minor supplement may seem brash, but ignorance of the balance can lead to unresolved ailments; thus, boldness allows one to exercise caution effectively.</p>
<p>Hence, a small heart paired with a bold spirit leads to complete wisdom, while a small heart and bold spirit together cultivate effective medical practices. In this way, suspicion of methods may disrupt wisdom, and caution may hinder boldness; therefore, these concepts must be articulated and expressed.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br><strong>The Treatise on Herbal Medicine: Commentary by Miao Xiyong in the Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five Principles for Healers</strong></p>
<p>All human ailments arise from a disregard for the lives of countless beings, exhausting human and material resources, and a tendency to kill birds, beasts, and insects. They may even unjustly impose punishment on the innocent. These various actions generate karma that leads to suffering in return. Those who practice medicine and serve as healers must feel compassion when witnessing suffering. They should carefully examine medical texts, diligently seek the path of healing, and thoroughly contemplate their practices, aiming for harmony with the natural order. </p>
<p>One must constantly reflect: if the remedy does not match the illness, and the illness does not connect with the right treatment, it could lead to irreversible consequences. Human life is of utmost importance, and retribution is inescapable. Do not sacrifice your conscience for momentary gain, as it may result in untold suffering in future lives—beware of this! Fear the repercussions rather than rejoice in temporary comforts. </p>
<p>For anyone aspiring to be a healer, they must first engage in scholarly study; and for those wishing to study, they must first learn to read. Literacy is the beginning of learning. Without understanding the meaning of characters, how can one grasp the texts? If the meanings are unclear, it becomes an obstacle to understanding.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br>Although one may be well-versed in poetry and prose, if one&#39;s spirit remains untainted, and if one becomes stagnant upon encountering the path, how can one achieve enlightenment? It is like facing a wall or being akin to a wooden puppet—desiring to alleviate the suffering of the people, yet finding it not difficult? Hence, in ancient times, they were called great physicians; today, we refer to them as Confucian physicians. Great physicians study deeply to understand principles, focusing on both body and mind, observing the world with cautious vigilance, seeking the middle path, and in moments of urgency, dare not act recklessly. Anything less would merely be considered common craft and not worthy of being called medicine.</p>
<p>For anyone who wishes to be a physician, it is essential to first understand medicine. The origin of medicine varies by region, affecting its quality; if it is harvested at the wrong time, its efficacy is entirely disrupted. Furthermore, markets may present counterfeit products that can easily confuse the genuine. Unless one recognizes the true qualities and diligently tests the properties and flavors, it is rare to avoid being misled. Just as a general who does not understand military strategy cannot achieve victories, a physician who is ignorant of medicine is in a similar plight. Having understood the medicines, one should then practice diligently in this field.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br>The thunder god&#39;s cannon is indeed a great method; however, there may be aspects that are not fully expressed. One must understand the essence and work diligently, without seeking superficial gains. This can be likened to food: if cooking is poorly done, it will not benefit people and may even cause harm. How much more cautious one must be with medicines that relate to life and death! </p>
<p>One must be careful about this! When becoming a physician, it is essential to remain humble, with an open mind, empty of preconceived notions. If one stubbornly clings to their own views, they will confront the world, becoming rigid and dismissive of others. This attitude will block the flow of wisdom. Even if one is close to others, they will ultimately gain no benefit. Growing old without gaining knowledge is indeed a sorrowful fate. If one holds onto rigid ideas and fails to transform, they may bring harm to others. In the quietness of the night, one ought to reflect deeply and feel shame. Moreover, one’s talents and insights are not innate; they must be acquired through learning and inquiry.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br>The benefits of studying are broad and difficult to measure; without a humble heart, how can one accept knowledge? It is shameful to lack learning, yet shameful to ask someone of lower status. A teacher&#39;s heart is sacred, but what benefit does it bring to the path? If one is not utterly foolish, can they not reflect upon this?</p>
<p>A physician does not worry about their skills being inadequate, but rather about not earning enough money. By abandoning their true vocation and seeking external favors, hoping for the approval of the influential to gain worldly esteem, even if they acquire great wealth, they cannot escape the toil. Considering the next life, is there not a recompense for this?</p>
<p>Such thoughts are painful rather than joyful, which is why one should diligently seek knowledge and skills to benefit others&#39; lives. Even if one achieves effectiveness, let it reward itself rather than seeking excessive returns. Treat all with an equal heart, and do not look down on the poor. By doing so, virtue will take root in oneself, and even the spirits will silently approve.</p>
<p>The five blessings just mentioned are all connected to physicians: their talents and skills, and the benefits and contributions they make. I earnestly hope that you will learn and follow my blessings, advancing in the path without being confined to mere techniques. Is it not the greatest fortune for living beings and the greatest illumination of this path?<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br><strong>Medical Laws of the Medical Field</strong><br><strong>(Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treating Illness</strong></p>
<p>Chang notes that during the Spring and Autumn period, Zuo&#39;s commentary was well-versed in medical principles, while Han scholars had ceased to study medicine. The Grand Historian has little to mention regarding those like Cang Gong, let alone others! Later, works such as &quot;Hua Yuanhua&#39;s Biography&quot; delve into the chaotic and superstitious, where it was indeed scholars who first determined the pulse diagnosis. There are many prescriptions from the Tang dynasty, which are not surprising. Those who discuss medicine in the &quot;Jiu Ling Shan Fang Ji&quot; should broadly read a variety of texts, seek the intentions of sages, and understand the return of natural laws. Is their ambition not vast?</p>
<p>The path of medicine requires precision to illuminate its principles and breadth to grasp its essentials. Therefore, previous scholars established teachings that required students to first read Confucian texts, understanding the principles of the &quot;Yi,&quot; the &quot;Suwen,&quot; and not to neglect the &quot;Bencao&quot; and &quot;Mai Jing.&quot; Without the Four Books, it is impossible to comprehend the subtlety of meanings; without the &quot;Yi,&quot; one cannot understand the changes of yin and yang; without the &quot;Suwen,&quot; one cannot recognize illnesses; without the &quot;Bencao,&quot; one cannot identify medicines; and without the &quot;Mai Jing,&quot; one has no method to diagnose and understand symptoms of cold, heat, deficiency, or excess. Sages have provided only a brief outline for people. Later scholars must integrate the strengths of various texts, apply what they observe in practice, and only then can they be deemed competent.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br>There are six major failures in dealing with illness: failing to examine properly, failing to trust, being out of date, failing to choose the right physician, not understanding the disease, and not knowing the medicine. The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; states: Those who are arrogant and disregard reason will not be treated; those who value wealth over life will not be treated; those whose clothing and food are unsuitable will not be treated; those whose yin and yang and internal qi are unsettled will not be treated; those whose bodies are weak and cannot take medicine will not be treated; those who believe in shamans rather than physicians will not be treated. In today&#39;s society, these are the common issues faced by patients. </p>
<p>Sun Simiao said: Many sick people have friends and old acquaintances come to inquire about their illnesses, yet these individuals have no experience, have not read medical texts, and self-pretend to be knowledgeable. They speak nonconventional views, some say it is illusory, some say it is real, some say it is wind, some say it is qi, with a multitude of erroneous claims, all differing, which confuse the patient’s thoughts, leaving them unsure of what is true. Time does not wait for anyone, and disaster suddenly arrives, causing everyone to scatter. This kind of situation is particularly concerning nowadays. Therefore, it is crucial to rely on good people and reputable physicians who understand the depth of diseases, thoroughly explore medical texts, and have broad knowledge of both ancient and modern practices; otherwise, it will lead to great misunderstandings and errors in treatment.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br><strong>The Meaning of Herbs</strong> 【Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang】</p>
<p><strong>First Discuss the Illness, Then Discuss the Medicine</strong></p>
<p>From ancient times to the present, each generation has its physicians, though they may differ in wisdom and stature, they must not abandon rules and standards to seek balance and clarity. Therefore, in treating illness, one must first understand the illness; only after understanding the illness can one discuss the medicine. Medicine is the means to overcome illness. If one understands the illness, they can choose one or two appropriate remedies from thousands of medicines, and these remedies will work effectively; if one does not understand the illness, there are many different approaches which may confuse the treatment. All medicines can harm a person, especially those that are the most obstinate.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been an increase in those studying medicine, yet medical practice has grown more chaotic, resulting in a world where medicine is discussed without consideration of the illness, which leads to countless tragedies. Some attribute this to fate, not knowing that the natural order does not favor killing or harming life. I often see families in officialdom, after a diagnosis, hastily prescribing a treatment to show their caution while failing to consider the source of the illness or how the medicine aligns with it; this leads physicians to resort to ambiguous discussions. When the medicine fails, they blame the lack of effective medicine, when in fact, effective medicines exist, but they do not dare to use them due to their ignorance of the disease.</p>
<p>Alas! Treatises like <em>Ling Shu</em>, <em>Su Wen</em>, <em>Nan Jing</em>, and <em>Jia Yi</em>, which contain fundamental principles, are seldom studied, while later works that do have prescriptions are venerated as treasures. For instance, Zhu Danxi&#39;s writing, <em>Pulse Diagnosis and Treatment</em>, discusses pulse first, then the cause, followed by symptoms, and lastly, treatment; yet this approach has fallen out of favor. Meanwhile, the book <em>Xing Fa</em> is filled with assorted prescriptions, forming a common doctrine.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br>The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; only describes the functions of medicinal properties, without addressing people&#39;s cravings. Additionally, the commentary by Miao includes both the virtues and flaws of these properties, which should necessarily be neglected. Without knowledge of the nature of plants and trees, we might take only a biased view to serve human needs, ignoring the flaws that need not be mentioned; many already discard such knowledge upon hearing it. Why not entirely revise the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica,&quot; retaining only those medicines that are faultless, potentially fifty to seventy kinds, and use those? The intent in the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; for physicians to gather toxic medicines for medical purposes, combined with the anxiety of past emperors regarding the completeness of the compendium, suggests a misunderstanding of this practice. To resolve this confusion, it is essential to discuss ailments in detail. When the nature of ailments is clearly understood, a specific ailment will coincide with specific medicines, even as diseases and medicines vary greatly. Beyond evolution&#39;s subtlety in nurturing life, identifying that a certain medicine is effective for a particular ailment, while another might be detrimental, leads to naming conventions. Without discussing ailments, how can we determine the efficacy and toxicity of medicines? It becomes evident that the notions of efficacy and toxicity in relation to medicines differ fundamentally from those related to bodily ailments. Those who are unaware insist on treating medicinal properties as fixed entities, which is quite narrow-minded. Therefore, Chang&#39;s discussions on ailments are not without necessity. In ancient times, experts on the platform could make clear predictions, and later generations would follow without fail; accumulating knowledge like a pile of rice, they ensured their earlier work was substantial. Though medicine may seem a minor path, it is no different. Chang, unable to change societal norms, truly desires to use this example to illuminate the mechanisms of diseases, examining what can be used and what cannot.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br><strong>Discussion on Diagnosing Illness</strong></p>
<p>In a certain year, month, and place, a certain person, of a certain age, possessing a certain physique—whether fat, thin, tall, or short; skin tone—whether black, white, or dry and moist; voice—whether clear, murky, long, or short; and the person&#39;s disposition—whether full of hardship or joy; when the illness began, what medicine was initially administered, what subsequent medications were taken, which medicine showed some effect, and which did not; presently, what is the balance between day and night, and the severity of cold and heat; preferences and aversions regarding food, as well as the frequency and quality of bowel movements; the pulses—what is unique in the three positions and nine qualities, what pulse is solely present among the twenty-four, and which pulses are combined; whether the symptoms are due to internal injury, external pathogens, both, or neither; based on the classics, what illness is diagnosed, what are the priorities between symptoms and root causes, what treatments are appropriate for sweating, vomiting, purging, and warming or nourishing—what medicines should be chosen from among the seven categories, which dosage from ten options, which elemental energy from five, which taste from five flavors, and what decoction is suitable for mixture and adjustment, and when should effects be expected. Each aspect must be clearly detailed to ensure no minute detail is overlooked. Such a comprehensive understanding should inspire confidence in others, and can serve as a model within the medical profession without the need for elaborate explanations. </p>
<p>For a certain year, it refers to the heavenly stems and earthly branches, and one must first clarify the nature of the season. For a certain month, diagnosis must align with the four seasons. For a certain place, distinctions between elevation, dryness, and humidity must be made, as well as the differing requirements by direction. For a certain age, physique, voice, and energy, these should correspond accurately to the pulse for totality.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br>The discernment of suffering and joy in relation to the physical form is to observe the interplay between the seven emotions and the exertions of labor and rest. To understand the origins of ailments, one must examine the changes transmitted over time. Inquire about symptoms, remedies, and their effectiveness to refine one’s own insights. Day and night, the temperature variations can clarify the distinctions between the vital and blood systems. The conditions of food intake and bowel movements indicate the harmony of the stomach and intestines. The examination of the three regions and nine pulses reveals the locations of diseases in the twelve meridians. Observing the appearance of the twenty-four pulses sheds light on the balance of yin and yang, ensuring accuracy. When diagnosing based on the classics, correct naming leads to coherent statements, allowing actions to align with prescribed measures. The priority of the fundamental and the branch suggests an understanding of the relative significance of conditions. The methods of sweating, vomiting, purging, warming, and nourishing must be specific and precise. The differentiation of remedies involves careful selection considering size, urgency, and characteristics, avoiding randomness. The ten prescriptions encompass the suitable applications for circulation, nourishment, and other effects without generalization. Among the five qi, the essence of each flavor must be applied as the highest method in treatment: balancing cold, heat, warmth, coolness, and neutrality with sour, pungent, sweet, bitter, and salty flavors. The term &quot;add and subtract&quot; for decoctions implies adherence to ancient practices rather than personal improvisation. The timing of effects should be precisely delineated, considering the acute versus chronic nature of the illness, with the five elements determining the healing period. Thus, the distribution of medical cases in practice is determined by skill, accumulated over decades, able to treat millions with unwavering precision.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br><strong>On Medicine</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, quack doctors would take lives; in the present, while they do not kill, they also do not save lives, leaving patients caught between not living and not dying, allowing their illnesses to worsen until they eventually die. Medicine has its rulers and subjects, just as people have strengths and weaknesses. With rulers and subjects, the dosage varies; with strengths and weaknesses, the remedy is adjusted accordingly. Too much leads to specialization, and specialization results in quick effects; a greater dose thickens the remedy, deepening its power. However, those who use medicine today tend to mix indiscriminately and prescribe uniformly, failing to discern clearly or treat boldly, which is why illnesses cannot be cured. Yet society regards merely not killing as a sign of virtue, unaware that the great doctors of old could not afford to make mistakes. The &quot;Book of Rites&quot; states that physicians at the end of the year should evaluate their medical practices to determine their sustenance: achieving ten successes is the highest, ten failures once earns a lower rank, and so on. Despite having three or four failures, ancient people still employed such doctors. Even Chunyu Yi, responding to Emperor Xiaowen, noted that mistakes are made from time to time, and it is impossible for ministers to be perfect in their duties. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: &quot;The insect of abundance comes to see misfortune.&quot;<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br>How can one solely rely on a rich and extravagant treatment? It is believed that even if the individual dies, it does not result from my actions. Alas! This is how Zhang Yu brought about the downfall of Han and how Li Linfu led to the fall of Tang. </p>
<p>According to Xu Yinzong in the &quot;Book of Tang&quot;: The great physicians of ancient times focused exclusively on distinguishing pulses; once the pulse was precisely identified, they then recognized the illness. The relationship between illness and medicine is such that there is a correct match—one needs only to use a single remedy that directly targets the illness. When the potency of the medicine is pure, the illness will promptly recover. Nowadays, people cannot distinguish pulses and their understanding of the source of illness is based solely on personal conjecture, often overloading the medicinal flavors, akin to a hunt where one does not know of the rabbit&#39;s location, scattering men and horses in vain hopes of capturing one, making the strategy ineffective. Suppose a certain medicine happens to suit the illness; if other flavors interfere, the energy and action are impeded, thus making it difficult to differentiate; this is indeed the reason. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Book of the Later Han,&quot; it is said that Hua Tuo excelled in formulas and used only a few types of medicines. A master catalogues six or five, relying on nine or two would predict success, while combining three or four would indicate failure. Therefore, when there are too many officials, there is disorder; when there are too many troops, there is defeat; matters of the world are likewise.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>

<p>　　圣人治未病，不治已病，非谓已病而不治，亦非谓已病而不能治也。盖谓治未病，在谨厥始，防厥微，以治之，则成功多而受害少也。惟治于始微之际，则不至于已着而后治之，亦自无已病而后治也。今人治已病，不治未病，盖谓病形未着，不加慎防，直待病势已着，而后求医以治之，则其微之不谨，以至于着，斯可见矣。圣人起居动履，罔不摄养有方，间有几微隐晦之疾，必加意以防之，用药以治之，圣人之治未病，不治已病有如此。《论语》曰：子之所慎，齐战疾。程云：齐，所以交神明，诚至而神格；疾为身之生死所关；战为国家存亡所系。<a id="orig-126p" href="#trans-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br>然此三慎，诚为最大，而疾与乎其中，得非以身为至重耶？康子馈药，则曰未达不敢尝，可见圣人慎疾慎医之心，至且尽矣。世之人非惟不知治未病，及至已病，尚不知谨。始初微略，恣意无忌，酿成大患，方急而求医，曾不加择，惟以其风闻，或凭其吹荐，委之狂愚，卒以巨坏，皆其平日慢不究心于医，至于仓卒不暇择请，殊不知医药人人所必用，虽圣人有所不免，顾在平昔讲求，稔知某为明医，偶有微疾，则速求之以药，治如反掌。譬能曲突徙薪，岂有焦头烂额之诮？丹溪论之，固亦详矣。甫之肤见，尤有未悉之意焉。续貂之讶，诚所不免。有志养生者，扩而充之，亦未必无小补云。<a id="orig-127p" href="#trans-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br>　　　　　古医十四科</p>
<p>　　古医十四科中有脾胃科，而今亡之矣。《道藏经》中颇有是说。自宋元以来，止用十三科考医政。其一为风科，次伤寒科，次大方脉科，次小方脉科，次妇人胎产科，次针灸科，次眼科，次咽喉口齿科，次疮疡科，次正骨科，次金镞科，次养生科，次祝由科。国朝亦惟取十三科而已，其脾胃一科，终莫之续。元李杲着《脾胃论》，极其精详。但不言十四科之阙，此不知其得旧本而加以己意欤？抑尽为创着而得上古之同然欤？是诚医道之大幸也。甫观今世医者，多不工于脾胃，只用反治之法，攻击疾病以治其标，惟知以寒治热，以热治寒，以通治塞，以塞治通而已。用寒因寒用，热因热用，通因通用，塞因塞用，必伏其所主，而先其所因，所谓从治之法，则漠然无所知也。及致脾胃损伤，犹不加察，元气一坏，变证多端。<a id="orig-128p" href="#trans-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br>如脾虚而气短不能以续，变而似喘促，医尚用降气定喘之药；如脾虚卫气不行，变而为浮肿，医尚用耗气利水之药；如脾虚郁滞，变而作寒热，医尚谓外感，用发散之药。大段类此，虚而益虚，直以气尽身亡，始用人参汤、附子汤灌之于殒绝之后，岂有能生之理乎？自今观之，不足者十常八九，况其时势竞驰驱于名利之涂，劳思伤脾而致病者，居其大半。若体实而偶为风寒暑湿之邪袭，则惟攻之而即愈者，亦不多见矣。此则中医治之易成功也。及遇脾胃虚而致风寒暑湿之邪袭，一同体实者而施治之，则大有间然者矣。攻之不已，则曰药不瞑眩，厥疾弗瘳。必大攻之，脾胃益伤而疾益笃，技穷无措则曰难医。时弊如斯，曷可胜纪？要皆不知本之故也。经曰：得谷者昌，失谷者亡。又曰：有胃气者生，无胃气者死。然则胃气谷气，得非人身之本欤？<a id="orig-129p" href="#trans-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br>　　　　　时医</p>

If there is truly no delusion, but medicine is used to treat it, it becomes delusion again; how can it be used? Hence, it cannot be tried. To try means to use temporarily, somewhat like tasting it. The essence is that if there is already no delusion and one still uses medicine, it becomes delusion again and brings about illness. In the Great Complete Book, Zhang of the Xi family says: Without delusion yet ill, and without delusion yet medicated, it becomes delusion and causes illness again. This is why the medicine of without falsehood cannot be tried. Confucius said: &quot;I do not dare to taste it; the sage does not try the medicine of delusion thus.”]</p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Commentary by Confucius states: &quot;When taking medicine, one must experience extreme dizziness; only then can the illness be cured.&quot; The commentary explains that dizziness leads to a dazed state of mind. The &quot;Dialectics&quot; mentions that consuming medicine that is toxic, especially in the regions between Dongqi and Haidai, is referred to as &#39;dizziness&#39; or &#39;light-headedness.&#39; Guo Pu notes that &#39;dizziness&#39; is a common expression. Thus, the act of the medicine attacking the illness first causes a state of confusion, and only then can healing occur. When it is said that dizziness is extreme, it indicates that the medicine works only when the mind is deeply affected.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Book of Rites,&quot; it states: &quot;When a ruler is ill and takes medicine, a minister must first taste it. If a parent is ill and takes medicine, a child must first taste it. A doctor must not administer medicine without a lineage of three generations.&quot; The Great Compilation by the Yanling Fang clan asserts: &quot;In ordinary times, when the ruler is not engaged in affairs, the servants taste the dishes, and the crown prince personally observes; this is to maintain caution. Thus, during illness, it is even more critical not to neglect this practice. If a medical skill is not passed down from father to son, it will not be refined. If the skill is not refined, how can its medicine be taken? The Zhou official&#39;s minister teaches based on experience, which is why this is stated. However, what is mentioned in the classics merely describes the norm. As for those who acquire knowledge not through inheritance but through personal understanding, they may still be accepted within three generations. Therefore, the Zhou officials&#39; physicians only regard the perfectly comprehensive method as the best; if the knowledge is not passed to the right person, it is not accepted, even after three generations. Hence, Confucius remarked that those without constancy should not be allowed to serve as shamans or doctors.&quot; The &quot;Collected Commentaries&quot; by Zheng states: &quot;One must assess their own capacity; a doctor should not administer medicine unless it has been tried on three generations; cautiousness must be observed.&quot;<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Confucius said: When a person is ill, they must take medicine. If a father and son pass down their knowledge through three generations, they can avoid mistakes and maintain balance. Furthermore, it is said: the three generations refer to the &quot;Yellow Emperor&#39;s Acupuncture,&quot; the &quot;Shennong&#39;s Materia Medica,&quot; and the &quot;Sunu&#39;s Pulse Formula.&quot; Without studying these three ancient texts, one should not take their medicine.</p>
<p>Lü of Lantian said: Confucius emphasized caution regarding diseases, warfare, and calamities. Disease is a serious matter. If one is not careful in the face of danger, they invite disaster, especially in the case of illnesses affecting one&#39;s ruler or parent. If a medicine makes one dizzy or fails to cure an illness, then the medicine aimed at curing the illness is never without toxicity. Preferences or aversions may lead to harmful outcomes, measuring doses may be inappropriate, and treating cold with heat or vice versa can have counterproductive effects. Mild misuse could worsen an ailment, and severe misuse could lead to death. As a subject or child, one must not use medicine without careful trial; there is no greater unfilial or disloyal act than that. This is why the heir is blamed for his ruler&#39;s assassination due to his failure to properly test the medicine.</p>
<p>Lü of Shanyin said: The knowledge passed down through three generations contains insights that cannot be easily discerned. The world says: the old practitioner provides experience, while the young one offers divination.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></p></div>

<p>There are two upper physicians, four lower physicians, two officials, two historians, and twenty apprentices. </p>
<p><strong>[Commentary: Zheng Kangcheng said: The physician is the leader among doctors. Chen Hongfu said: The use of a person’s body, akin to that of heaven and earth, requires balance; excess leads to harm, and deficiency needs to be compensated, which is the way of heaven. Without an understanding of the principles of creation and the changes of fullness and emptiness, how could one know the specific conditions of a person&#39;s vital energy? This is indeed crucial to the smallest detail. How could later generations of mediocre physicians comprehend this matter, thus establishing Zhou with the gentlemen to oversee it?]</strong> </p>
<p><strong>[Xue Pingzhong said: From the cook to the butcher, cooks are interconnected in their duties, thus the position of food physician can also be aligned with them. It is special to place them among the physicians, truly reflecting the way a ruler protects and nurtures. However, the former kings did not want to indulge themselves at the expense of the people, which is why they appointed physicians ahead of food physicians; to manage diseases affecting the populace. After establishing food physicians, the roles of disease physicians, wound physicians, and animal physicians followed in sequence. Indeed, kindness originates from oneself and extends to the people, and concern for living beings truly arises from each sip and morsel.]</strong></p>

Only with complete knowledge can one participate in medical matters.</p>
<p>In any state with diseases, those with ulcers should be treated separately by physicians, and at the end of each year, their medical affairs should be reviewed to determine food provisions.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Those who serve above with their skills find it particularly difficult in medicine; it is vital to be cautious concerning diseases. How could the ancient kings dare to rely on a single person to bear the skills of two or three? Therefore, beneath the physician, there are specialists for ailments, and dietary management does not overlap with treating illnesses; beneath the ailment physician, there are ulcer specialists, who examine internal conditions without overlapping with external signs; beneath the ulcer physician, there are veterinarians, treating animals without overlapping with humans. One must pursue excellence without wishing for superfluousness; this illustrates the benevolence of the ancient kings.</p>
<p>Among the physicians of ailments, there are eight specialists, responsible for the health of all people’s diseases by regulating the five flavors, five grains, and five medicines to nurture their ailments. </p>
<p>According to Zheng Kangcheng, the five medicines include herbs, trees, insects, stones, and grains. &quot;Nurture&quot; is akin to &quot;treat.&quot; Diseases arise from the balance of qi, so one must attack what is excessive and nurture what is deficient. As the Wang family stated, &quot;The Suwen says, when the form is insufficient, warm it with qi; when the essence is insufficient, replenish it with flavors.&quot; Flavors nurture the essence, grains nurture the form, and medicines treat the illnesses. Nurturing the essence is fundamental, nurturing the form is secondary, and treating diseases is the last priority. Lü&#39;s teachings suggest first using the five flavors and five grains, then following up with five medicines, acknowledging that treating with medicine comes last. Yet, is it only physicians who practice this? </p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Jia states that internal illnesses are not visible to others; however, by observing a person&#39;s sounds and color, one can discern the severity of their condition. Wang further explains that by looking at their breath, listening to their sounds, and watching their color, one can determine life or death based on five indicators, and using food and medicine to treat the illness also follows this five-fold principle. Thus, changes in the body and movements of the internal organs can be regarded similarly. When people suffer from illness, they should be treated based on their specific conditions, and at the end of the year, each should document these for the physician.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Jia notes that for illnesses, there are eight skilled practitioners who specialize in treating them, necessitating a division in treatment. The eight practitioners responsible for treating ulcers and wounds manage the blessings, medications, cuts, and cauterizations involved in healing.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: It is my humble understanding that medical practices rely on blessings, which are perhaps reasonable. In contemporary times, some use techniques like sealing ulcers based on this traditional method. If the blessings do not help, medication is used; if the medicine is ineffective, cutting away the bad blood is necessary; if cutting does not heal, additional medication is required to remove the harmful tissue. Each method has varying degrees of applicability, hence it is said they are comparable.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>&quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;: In the 19th year of Duke Zhao&#39;s reign, in the summer of the fifth month on the day of Wuchan, the heir of Xu made an attempt to assassinate his lord, Mai. &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;: Duke Dao of Xu fell ill and took the medicine that the crown prince had prescribed, and ultimately the crown prince fled to Jin, where it was recorded: he assassinated his lord. A gentleman said: One should dedicate their heart and strength to serving their lord; it is permissible to forego medicine. Hu’s commentary on the Zuo tradition states that Duke Dao of Xu was ill and took the medicine prescribed by the heir; the record states he assassinated his lord because he did not try the medicine first. In ancient times, a physician would not administer medicine across three generations; one would not take medicine administered by others. The things the Master was cautious about were three, with illness being one of them. When Ji Kangzi sent medicine, he said: &quot;Qiu has not yet understood, therefore I dare not try it.&quot; If the lord is ill and drinks medicine, the minister must try it first; if the father is ill and drinks medicine, the son must try it first. This highlights the importance of caution. If one hastily uses medicine without choosing a proper physician, and advances medicine untested to the lord, this reflects a neglect of the lordly and paternal respect, showing a lack of caution. </p>
<p>[In the comprehensive account, Zhang says: The reason a medication might lead to death is manifold; thus, we speak of illness. Today&#39;s treatments for malaria involve arsenic and often lead to cures, however, improper preparation has led to many deaths. The death of Duke Dao must have been of this sort. Commentary states: According to the records, Duke Xu consumed the prescribed medicine and passed away, indeed not an assassination, but blaming the heir for not leaving behind the medicinal concerns suggests that one should trust the physician rather than administer it themselves. A filial son should perform with dedication and prayers only; the dosing of medicines is not something to be learned by experience. The heir of Xu served the nation, and the country was not without physicians; thus, hastily advancing medicine brought guilt akin to assassination, primarily to instruct on distant prevention.]<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a></p></div>

If one only administers medicine after the disease has developed, or intervenes after chaos has broken out, it is like digging a well when one is thirsty or forging weapons after a battle; is that not too late?<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a></p></div>

<p>Chronic illness leads to transformation; if the upper and lower do not align, a skilled physician should not intervene. Therefore, when yang accumulates, illness can lead to death, and the yang energy becomes isolated. Isolation must be resolved, and if not promptly treated, it can lead to decline.</p>
<p><strong>On the True Words of the Golden Coffer</strong></p>
<p>A good pulse practitioner carefully examines the five internal organs and six bowels, observing their interplay: one goes against, one follows, noting the correspondence of yin and yang, surface and interior, and the balance of male and female. This is understood in the heart and aligns with essence. One should not teach the unworthy nor impart the untrue; this is called attaining the Way.</p>
<p><strong>On the Great Discussion of Yin and Yang Correspondences and Symbols</strong></p>
<p>In treating illness, one must seek the root cause. Therefore, if treatment does not conform to heavenly principles or does not follow earthly rationale, calamity will ensue. Hence, when an evil wind arrives, it comes swiftly like wind and rain. A skilled healer addresses the skin first, then the flesh, followed by the tendons, then the six bowels, and finally the five internal organs, as treating the five organs can be a matter of life or death.</p>
<p>Thus, an adept needle practitioner draws yin from yang and vice versa; they treat the right side with knowledge of the left and the left side with understanding of the right; they recognize the other by knowing the self, the exterior by understanding the interior, and they discern excess and deficiency. By observing subtle signs and avoiding misdiagnosis, they use treatment effectively without peril.</p>
<p>A skilled diagnostician examines color and takes the pulse, first distinguishing yin from yang, clarifying purity and turbidity to determine affected portions. They observe respiration, listen to sounds, and identify areas of suffering, assess balance and proportion, and discern the primary illness by their pulse examination, skillfully diagnosing symptoms without error, thus ensuring accuracy in treatment.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Discussion of the Spiritual Orchid&#39;s Secret Classics</strong></p>
<p>The true way lies in the subtle, with endless transformations; who knows its origin? How perplexing! The dissipating element is elusive, who knows its essence? In a timely manner, who acts wisely? In the nebulous calculations, life emerges from minute details; the minutiae arise from measurements. Hundreds and thousands can lead to great benefits; extending it greatly, its form is accomplished. The Yellow Emperor said: &quot;Well said! I have heard of the path of essence and light, the great saint&#39;s undertaking, which clarifies the great way. It is not through fasting and selecting auspicious days that one can dare to accept it.&quot; The Emperor then chose auspicious days with good omens and stored the Spiritual Orchid in his chambers to pass it on and preserve it.</p>

<p>In treating illness, one must first examine the lower parts, match the pulse, observe the spirit and intentions alongside the illness.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on the Transformation of Essence and Qi</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked: &quot;I have heard that in ancient times, curing illnesses relied solely on the transformation of essence and qi, and could be done through blessings. In today&#39;s world, diseases are treated with poisonous medicines for internal issues, and needles and stones for external troubles. Sometimes one recovers, sometimes not; why is this?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;In ancient times, people lived among beasts, moved to avoid the cold, and stayed still to escape the heat. Internally, they were free from emotional burdens, and externally, they were not burdened by social roles. This was a harmonious era, and thus, evil forces could not penetrate deeply. Therefore, poisonous medicines could not treat internal issues, and needles and stones could not address external troubles; hence, they could transform essence and bless as required. However, in today&#39;s world, it is not the same. Inner worries and external pains prevail, and people have lost harmony with the seasons, going against the natural flow of cold and heat. Harmful winds frequently arrive, and weakening evils come morning and night, penetrating the five organs and bones, injuring the skin and voids. Hence, minor ailments become severe, and major ailments lead to death; thus, blessings can no longer be effective.&quot; </p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to observe the conditions of patients, to see life and death, to resolve doubts, and to understand the essentials, like the light of the sun and moon. Can this be conveyed to me?&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The colors and pulses are what the sovereigns value, and they were passed down by the earlier masters. In ancient times, practitioners used to study the color and pulse to connect with the divine, aligning with the five elements—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—and the four seasons, eight winds, and the six harmonies, never straying from the norm. They would adapt their understanding to observe the intricacies and grasp the essentials. To know the essentials, the colors and pulses are key.&quot;<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Color responds to the sun, and pulse responds to the moon; one consistently seeks the essence, and that essence is revealed. The changes in color reflect the seasonal energies; this is what the Supreme Deity values, aligning with the divine. Thus, one distances from death and approaches life, cultivating the path of existence, leading to the title of Sage King. </p>
<p>In ancient times, illness was treated by understanding its root. Boiling herbal liquids for ten days could dispel eight winds and five blockages. If illness persisted for ten days, one would then use the branches of herbal plants as aids. When the root cause was addressed, the harmful energies yielded.</p>
<p>However, in the later ages, treatment deviated from the four seasons, lacking an understanding of the sun and moon, and misjudging the trends of illness. When the symptoms were already established, they would seek to treat superficially with needles and internally with herbal liquids, using coarse methods rashly, believing they could attack the illness. As a result, the illness would persist, and new ailments would arise.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;I wish to hear the essential principles!&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The essence of treatment lies in ensuring no neglect of color and pulse. If one uses it without confusion, they achieve great results. Following or going against the natural order, if the root cause isn’t addressed, the spirit is lost and the state falls. By discarding the old and embracing the new, one can attain the status of a true human.&quot;</p>
<p>The Emperor said: &quot;I have heard its essence from my teacher. My teacher spoke of color and pulse, which is what I know.&quot; Qi Bo replied: &quot;The pinnacle of treatment lies in unity.&quot; The Emperor asked: &quot;What do you mean by unity?&quot; Qi Bo said: &quot;Unity arises from understanding. The Emperor asked: &quot;How can this be achieved?&quot; Qi Bo said: &quot;Close the doors and block the windows; inquire deeply about the patient&#39;s situation, to align with their intention. Those who gain the spirit thrive, while those who lose the spirit perish.&quot; The Emperor said: &quot;Excellent.&quot;<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Decoctions and Fermented Liquor</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: In ancient times, sages created decoctions and fermented liquors but did not use them; why is that? Qi Bo replied: Since ancient times, sages made these drinks as preparations. In ancient times, decoctions were made but not consumed. During the Middle Ages, the virtues declined slightly, and evil energies arrived, hence they were consumed for complete healing.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: In today’s world, is it unnecessary to do so? Qi Bo replied: In the present age, one must directly attack poison with medicines for internal issues, while using needles and stones to treat external afflictions.</p>
<p>The Emperor asked: What about when the body is weak and blood is exhausted, and yet the treatment does not take effect? Qi Bo replied: This is because the spirit is not responsive. The Emperor asked: What does it mean that the spirit is unresponsive? Qi Bo replied: It refers to the methods of needles and stones. If the spirit does not advance and one&#39;s will is not directed toward healing, the illness cannot be cured.</p>
<p>The Emperor said: When an illness first manifests, it is extremely subtle and refined; it must first be lodged within the skin. Today, skilled doctors all say that when an illness is fully manifested, it is termed a reverse condition, hence needles and stones cannot treat it, nor can good medicines reach it. Nowadays, skilled practitioners have their methods and adhere to their practices, relatives and friends hear sounds daily, and they see colors every day, yet the illness does not heal; what flaw remains unaddressed? Qi Bo replied: The illness is the root, and the practitioner is merely the branch. Without grasping the root, the evil energy will not subside.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Pain Discourse</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: I have heard that those who articulate the heavenly truths must have their evidence in human experience; those who speak of the ancients must align with the present; those who discuss humanity must have a profound understanding of themselves. If so, then the Way is clear and the essential truths become apparent, which is what is called clarity.</p>
<p><strong>On the Essentials of the Ultimate Truth</strong></p>
<p>Qi Bo said: The emergence of diseases comes from various sources; some arise from the root, some from the superficial, and some from the inner Qi. Some are derived from the root, some from the superficial, some from the inner Qi, and some from a combination of superficial and root causes. There are those that arise from oppositional forces and those that are derived from harmonies. Opposition is in contrast to harmony; what is harmonious can become oppositional. Therefore, it is said knowing the superficial and the root will ensure no peril in their application. Understanding opposition and harmony allows for righteous practice without inquiries. This is what is meant. Not knowing this is insufficient for diagnosis and leads to disruptions in the meridians. Hence, the essence states: Rough practitioners laugh it off as knowable. Words on heat have not yet ceased, and cold diseases begin anew. Similar emitted energies of different forms confound diagnoses and disrupt the meridians. This is what is meant. The Emperor said: All diseases arise from wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire; these transform and change. The classics say that the excessive should be drained, and the deficient should be supplemented. I bestow this to the practitioners, but they still have yet to achieve perfection. I wish to ensure that the essential Way is practiced; let the drums and gongs respond harmoniously, just like removing thorns and clearing dirt. Is there a skillful and divine method that can be shared? Qi Bo said: Careful observation of the condition of the disease must not neglect the critical energies.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, valuing the release from power, though one is not involved in evil, if the spirit is internally wounded, the body must perish. Being wealthy initially and then becoming poor, though not due to evil, leads to skin burning and sinews bending, resulting in weakness and contractions. If a physician cannot be strict and cannot engage the spirit, being externally weak and disordered will lead to the loss of normalcy; if the condition cannot change, then medical affairs will not succeed. This is one of the four missteps in treatment.</p>
<p>In all diagnoses, one must know the beginning and the end. Understanding the remaining traces, taking pulses and asking names, one must align with male and female. Separation and blockage, worry, fear, joy, and anger lead to the emptiness of the five organs and the departure of blood and qi. If the skilled cannot understand, then what technique can they speak of? Experiences of wealth that lead to great injuries cut sinews and sever pulses; if the body recovers, it causes unremitting harm, leading to the failure of vital connections, leaving insufficient return of yang, causing accumulation of pus and cold. If a novice treats it, hastily needling yin and yang, the body will disintegrate, limbs will cramp, and death will be certain. If the physician cannot be clear, does not inquire about the cause, and only speaks of the day of death, this is also a sign of a novice.

Therefore, it is said: When a sage treats illness, they must comprehend the principles of heaven and earth, the yin and yang, the seasonal changes, the functions of the five organs and six intestines, as well as the relationship between male and female. They must know the methods of needling, moxibustion, stones, and the principles of poisons. They should approach human affairs calmly, to clarify the canonical way. Rich and poor, high and low, each has its own patterns and principles.

<p>The way to treat illness considers inner energy as a treasure. By seeking its principles, if one cannot find them, the problem lies in the external and internal. By adhering to data in treatment, one should not deviate from the principles of healing. Those who can apply this technique throughout their lives will remain safe. If one does not understand the principles, the five organs may become heated, leading to sores in the six intestines; misdiagnosing the illness indicates a failure to maintain normalcy. Careful adherence to this method, in conjunction with the classics, aligns upper and lower texts and assesses yin and yang.

<p>In diagnosing ailments, one should not neglect to inquire about their origins, the troubles arising from failures in diet, and the excesses in daily living, which may result in harm from toxins.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Rise and Fall</strong></p>
<p>The Emperor said: Diagnosis has ten degrees, including measuring the pulse, assessing the organs, evaluating the flesh, examining the tendons, and discerning the points. When the essence of yin and yang is exhausted, illness manifests naturally. The pulse is irregular, and yin disperses while yang prevails. When the pulse is faint and lacking, the diagnosis is inconsistent. Diagnosis must encompass both the upper and lower states, considering the people, the ruler, and the ministers. If one does not receive teaching completely, one’s skills remain unclear. Failing to discern what is contrary or in agreement leads to erroneous actions. Holding onto the feminine while losing the masculine, favoring yin over yang without understanding their union, results in unclear diagnoses. The teachings must be transmitted to future generations, reflecting upon themselves. When yin is extremely deficient, the heavenly qi is severed; when yang is overly abundant, the earthly qi is insufficient. </p>
<p>The synchrony of yin and yang is where the wise person acts. In this synchrony, yang qi arrives first, followed by yin qi. Therefore, the sage upholds the way of diagnosis by prioritizing the sequence of yin and yang. The dynamic of the extraordinary and the ordinary culminates in sixty beginnings. The subtle matters of diagnosis align with the changes in yin and yang, reflecting the emotions contained within five principles, examining the essence of emptiness and fullness, and establishing the required degrees—this is sufficient for diagnosis. Thus, if one cannot palpate the yin, the yang diagnosis will wither away.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a></p></div>

One may know the left but not the right, or know the right but not the left; one may know the top but not the bottom, or know the beginning but not the end—therefore, governance does not last long. One knows the ugly and the good, knows sickness and health, knows high and low, knows sitting and standing, knows action and stillness; using these with regulation, one grasps the Way completely, thus avoiding peril for eternity. </p>
<p>One arises with reserves and knows one’s deficiencies. In addressing matters, one understands the upper and lower, the pulse and its conditions; hence, if the body is weak and energy is deficient, death follows. If the body has excess but energy is lacking, life ceases. </p>
<p>Thus, diagnosis has standard principles, sitting and standing have their constants. There are established ways of entering and exiting, focusing the spirit keenly. One must be clear and tranquil, observing above and below, managing the eight right and wrongs, distinguishing the five central categories, feeling the pulse’s movement and stillness, following the fluctuations of cold and heat, considering its size, matching it with possible ailments, discerning whether to go against or follow, and then further identifying the names of maladies—all this makes diagnosis complete and avoids losing a sense of humanity. </p>
<p>Thus, in diagnosis, one observes breath and intention without losing coherence. The Way is clear and discerning, allowing longevity.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Yellow Emperor was in the Ming Hall when Lei Gong asked, &quot;I have received teachings about applying the principles from classic texts, instructing on the theories of yin and yang, acupuncture, moxibustion, and medicinal substances. In practice, there are the wise and the unwise, and one cannot always achieve perfection. If one first speaks of sorrow, joy, anger, and fear, of dryness, dampness, cold, and heat, as well as the distinctions of yin and yang among men and women, I seek to understand the underlying reasons for these matters. Regarding the statuses of lowly or wealthy, the forms of people, and their relationships with the world, one must carefully heed the commands. I have humble and foolish inquiries not covered in the classics, and I wish to know their nature.&quot; The Emperor replied, &quot;This is profound!&quot;</p>
<p>The Classic of the Spiritual Axis</p>
<p>On the Pathologies of Evil Qi in the Organs</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor asked Qi Bo, &quot;I have heard that by observing color, one can know a disease, which is called ‘ming’ (brightness); by feeling the pulse, one knows the disease, which is called ‘shen’ (spirit); by inquiring about the illness, one knows its location, which is termed ‘gong’ (work). I wish to learn how to see it, understand it, feel it, and inquire thoroughly about it. What should I do?&quot; Qi Bo responded, &quot;Color and pulse correspond to each other as do the resonance of a drum and a stick; they cannot be separated. This also pertains to the root and leaves: when the root dies, the leaves wither. The relationship between color, pulse, and flesh cannot be separated. Therefore, understanding one indicates mastery of work (gong), understanding two indicates spirit (shen), and understanding three indicates both spirit and brightness. Thus, those adept in feeling the pulse do not rely on color; those skilled in assessing color do not depend on the pulse. Those who can integrate and apply these can be considered top practitioners, achieving ten out of ten nine times. Those who apply two qualify as intermediate practitioners, achieving ten out of ten seven times. Those who apply one qualify as lower practitioners, achieving ten out of ten six times.&quot;<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a></p></div>

<p>The essence of using acupuncture lies in understanding the balance of yin and yang. When yin and yang are harmonized, the vital energy can shine forth. Integrating spirit and energy allows the spirit to be contained within. Therefore, it is said that the skilled practitioner regulates the energy, the intermediate practitioner causes disharmony in the pulse, and the unskilled practitioner brings danger to life. Thus, it is stated that the unskilled practitioner must proceed with caution. One must carefully examine the changes in the five organs’ illnesses, the responses of the five pulses, the realities and insufficiencies of the meridians, and the softness and brittleness of the skin before taking action.</p>

<p>Those who practice acupuncture must understand the effects of age, the fluctuations of qi, and the origins of deficiency and excess, or they cannot be considered skilled practitioners.</p>
<p><strong>Reversal and Order of Thickness and Thinness</strong></p>
<p>Qi Bo said: The way of the sage corresponds above with heaven, below with earth, and in the middle with human affairs. There must be clear principles to formulate measures. The methods of regulation and precision can later be transmitted. Thus, a craftsman cannot abandon the measurements and mistakenly envision lengths or depths, nor ignore the tools and create level waters. A worker cannot ignore the compass to create a circle, nor discard the square to create a rectangle.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Harmonizing Qi across the Four Seasons</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: If there are variations in the times, what could be the reason? Qi Bo replied: It is due to the failure to harmonize with the seasonal qi; when an organ is solely affected by disease, it must be due to the qi of that organ being weak against the seasonal influence, while its stronger seasonal counterparts arise. The Yellow Emperor asked: How should one treat this? Qi Bo replied: By aligning with the timing of nature, one can effectively address the illness. To be in harmony is to be skilled; to act against it is to be crude.</p>
<p><strong>On Deviant Winds</strong></p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor said: What is the reason for those who simply chant a blessing? Qi Bo replied: The ancient shamans understood the victories of various ailments and were aware of the origins of those illnesses, thus they could merely chant blessings.</p>
<p><strong>On the Twelve Difficulties</strong></p>
<p>The scriptures state: When the pulses of the five organs are exhausted internally, needling should be directed externally; when the pulses of the five organs are exhausted externally, needling should turn inward. How does one distinguish between the internal and external failures? Indeed, when the pulses in the five organs are exhausted internally, it also signifies the exhaustion of the kidney and liver pulses; yet, the physician mistakenly reinforces the heart and lungs. Conversely, when the pulses of the five organs are exhausted externally, the heart and lung pulses are similarly depleted; however, the physician wrongly reinforces the kidneys and liver. Complementing yang when yin is depleted, and complementing yin when yang is depleted—this is termed reality and illusion, diminishing the insufficient and augmenting the excessive. In such cases, the physician is essentially responsible for the patient’s demise.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Thirteen Difficulties</p>
<p>The classic text states that when one sees the complexion but cannot detect the pulse, if one finds a pulse that is victorious over another, it signifies death; if one finds a pulse that nurtures another, the illness will resolve itself. The colors and pulses should correspond; but how should this be done? Indeed. Each of the five organs has five colors, which can all be observed on the face, and they should also correspond with the pulse at the wrist. For example, if the color is blue, the pulse should be taut and quick; if red, the pulse should be floating, large, and scattered; if yellow, the pulse should be moderate and large; if white, the pulse should be floating, thin, and short; if black, the pulse should be deep, moist, and slippery. This illustrates how the five colors correspond with the five pulses. If the pulse is rapid, then the skin at the wrist is also rapid; if the pulse is quick, the skin is also quick; if the pulse is slow, the skin is also slow; if the pulse is thin, the skin is also thin; if the pulse is slippery, the skin is also slippery. Each organ has its own sound, color, smell, and taste, which should correspond with the pulse at the wrist; failure to correspond indicates illness. For instance, if the color is blue, and the pulse is floating, thin, and short, it would indicate a victory if it is large and slow; floating and large, and small and slippery would indicate nurturing. The classic states that knowing one signifies being a lesser practitioner, knowing two represents a mid-level practitioner, and knowing three signifies a superior practitioner. The superior practitioner achieves perfection nine times out of ten, the mid-level practitioner achieves eight out of ten, and the lesser practitioner achieves six out of ten.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>Chapter 77</h3>
<p>The classics say, &quot;The superior healer addresses the disease before it manifests; the intermediate healer treats the disease once it appears.&quot; What does this mean? Indeed, treating a disease before it manifests refers to recognizing the illness of the liver, which is known to affect the spleen. Thus, one first strengthens the spleen&#39;s qi to prevent the invasion of the liver’s pathogenic influence, hence it is said to treat before the disease. The intermediate healer, however, sees the liver illness and focuses solely on the liver without understanding the connections, thus it is said to treat the disease after it manifests.</p>
<h3>Chapter 81</h3>
<p>The classics say, &quot;There is both reality and illusion; one drains what is insufficient while benefiting what is excessive—this is the pulse at the wrist. Is the nature of the disease related to these realities and illusions? How should one balance the depletion and the excess?&quot; Indeed, it is not the pulse at the wrist that signifies illness; it indicates that the disease itself has realities and illusions. For instance, if the liver is full and the lung is deficient, where the liver represents wood and the lung represents metal, wood and metal should balance each other. One must know to balance metal with wood. Conversely, if the lung is full and the liver is deficient, and there’s little qi, one should not supplement the liver with needles, but rather focus on reducing the excessive lung condition. Thus, it is said there is reality and illusion; depleting what is insufficient while benefiting what is excessive. This is detrimental to the intermediate healer. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Question:</strong> What does it mean to treat diseases before they occur? </p>
<p><strong>Master:</strong> To treat diseases before they occur means to recognize the illness of the liver and understand how it affects the spleen; therefore, one should first strengthen the spleen. If the spleen, the ruler of the four seasons, does not suffer from evil influences, then it should not be supplemented. An intermediate practitioner, lacking this understanding, will see liver illness but will only treat the liver without resolving the spleen.</p>
<p><strong>Path to Eliminate Illness:</strong> </p>
<p>The method to eliminate illness focuses on observing symptoms, inquiring about preferences, examining the causes of disease, and considering the common ailments of the time; thus, one can trace the course of an illness from beginning to end. Once the disease is understood, treat external diseases internally and address upper issues to rescue lower issues. Differentiate between the deficiency and excess of organ diseases, recognize the relationships between mother and child organs, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and tailor the prescriptions accordingly, leading to a superior practitioner’s expertise. The best prescriptions use single flavors, two flavors come second, and multiple flavors rank lowest. Sour flavors enter the bones, sweet flavors resolve toxins, bitter flavors eliminate heat, salty flavors guide downward, and spicy flavors disperse stagnation. One should test the medicine; if it has not been tested, be cautious about hasty use. Once the major condition has passed, residual symptoms should not be treated again with medicine. Those who are well-nourished should receive ample doses, while the frail and weak should have reduced doses. </p>
<p>Using medicine is like waging war, and utilizing a physician is like employing a general. A good military leader may not rely solely on war chariots; a proficient herbalist shows the effectiveness of ginger and cassia. Knowing a person&#39;s abilities to assign them to a task represents the way of employing generals; knowing the techniques to prescribe denotes the way of employing physicians. In the world, there are no difficult-to-treat diseases, only poorly skilled physicians; there are no irreplaceable medicines, only inadequately skilled individuals who misprescribe. Among the common people, certain deaths can be recognized.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Examination of the Subtle</strong></p>
<p>Illness can mistakenly be perceived as coolness and then result in true coldness; there can also be phenomena that appear to be true but are actually false. A small deviation can lead to significant loss of life. The &quot;Floating Chest Sutra&quot; in the chapter on the two energies states: All diarrhea is due to heat, and all coolness relates to regulation. Heat first affects the inner organs, while cold first influences the blood&#39;s warmth. In the chapter on abdominal ailments, it states: Dry pain should at times be considered as caused by worms, and residual stabbing pain often leads to swelling. The chapter on cold damage indicates: Wind patterns and epidemics, damp heat and lingering phlegm, cause malaria and rashes, all similar to cold damage. When malaria is common, one should take precautions against it; when rashes are common, one should be wary of catching them. Spring plagues and summer epidemics first reveal internal symptoms. For dampness and heat, it is advisable to test with certain herbs like Lingzhi and Atractylodes. When administering dispersing agents, both vomiting and sweating must occur; such symptoms indicate lingering phlegm and, if not guided properly, may lead to limb dysfunction. Alas! Some illnesses are subtle yet deadly, while conditions that seem severe are easily treated. The precision of subtle differentiation is the hallmark of great practitioners in the world!<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></p></div>

<p>Yin Yancheng asked: In today&#39;s world, is there a way to engage with the works of ancient masters? The response was: A good teacher and friend, a skilled physician, learn through words and recognize changes; they review old texts, using nets to seek fish. With extensive knowledge of diseases, multiple diagnoses, and repeated use of effective medicines, what shame is there in being compared to ancient people!</p>
<p><strong>Discussion on Medicine</strong></p>
<p>A physician cannot be entrusted to one who is not benevolent, wise, and discerning. They must also be honest and genuinely good. Therefore, in ancient times, those who practiced medicine were carefully chosen from well-known families, possessing virtue and the ability to be compassionate and loving. They had to be intelligent and articulate, capable of understanding the celestial and spiritual realms, discerning the factors of life and death, distinguishing between vacuity and actuality, determining the rules of oppositions and agreements, evaluating the severity of ailments, and adjusting medicine&#39;s dosage accordingly, paying attention to the subtle and the profound, without neglecting the minute details. Thus, they are called good doctors. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Daoists value coolness, using plants that grow in cold; meanwhile, doctors advocate warmth, facilitating the flow of blood and channels. It is not enough to grasp the general principles; one must understand the finer details, including the balance of hardness and softness, the nuances of seasonal changes, and the regulations of intake and excretion. Renowned physicians examine the pulse at the three positions of the wrist, which reveals the truth. They measure the seasonal changes and assess warmth and cold, observing the pulse dynamics and aligning weight with lightness, proportioning medicine and minerals accordingly. This can be called a renowned physician. There are those who are well-known yet ineffective, and others who remain obscure yet are proficient. Those in authority who employ physicians must thoroughly evaluate and discern their qualifications.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Book of Sui</p>
<p>The Treatise on Classics</p>
<p>Medical prescriptions are techniques used to remove illnesses and preserve life. The heavens have the dualities of yin and yang, the elements of wind and rain, and cycles of light and darkness; humans experience emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow, love, and hatred. By regulating these emotions, one achieves harmony and balance, whereas indulging exclusively leads to deterioration and illness. Thus, the sage understands the essence of blood vessels, using needles and stones, employing medicinal substances, regulating the internal balance, nurturing energy, unblocking stagnation, and alleviating constrictions, thus returning to a state of simplicity. Those skilled in this can understand governance through pulse diagnosis and relate illnesses to the state. The physician&#39;s role, as detailed in the Zhou rituals, involves gathering various medicines to treat all who are ill; this is their duty. If the unworthy engage in this, they undermine the fundamental nature. Therefore, it is said that those with illnesses who do not seek treatment will invariably rely on traditional medicine.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On the Great Physician&#39;s Precision and Sincerity</strong></p>
<p>Zhang Zhan said: The difficulty in mastering the classic formulas has existed for a long time. Today, diseases can have similar internal characteristics but different external manifestations, and vice versa. Therefore, the fullness and emptiness of the five organs and six bowels, as well as the circulation and obstruction of blood and qi, cannot be discerned merely by sight and hearing; they must first be diagnosed and examined. The pulse at the inch and the cun can show various irregularities such as floating, sinking, tightness, and slackness. The acupoints can have differences in elevation and depth, while the skin, muscles, and bones may vary in thickness and softness. Only those who are meticulous and discerning can truly understand these matters.</p>
<p>To seek the most refined and subtle knowledge through coarse and superficial thinking is perilous! If one adds to what is already full, depletes what is empty, aggravates what is open, and obstructs what is blocked, if one cools what is cold and warms what is hot, this only exacerbates the illness while hoping for recovery; I have seen such patients perish. Therefore, the art of medicine and divination is challenging to perfect. If it were not divinely inspired, how could one grasp the profound and subtle? In this world, there are fools who, after studying formulas for three years, claim there are no diseases that can be treated, and after three years of treating diseases, come to realize that there are no formulas that can be universally applied.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a></p></div>

</div>
<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Therefore, scholars must extensively explore the sources of medicine, diligently and tirelessly, avoiding hearsay while claiming to have grasped the medical path. This is truly lamentable! Any great physician treating illness must first calm the mind and settle the will, free from desires and aspirations. They should cultivate profound compassion and a heart of pity, vowing to universally relieve the suffering of all sentient beings. When someone in distress comes seeking help, they must not inquire about wealth or poverty, status or age, beauty or ugliness, familial ties or friendships, whether they are of the nobility or the common folk; they should regard everyone as equals, akin to one&#39;s closest kin. Furthermore, they must not look forward or backward, worrying about fortune and misfortune, nor should they be concerned about their own safety. Witnessing others in pain, one should feel as if it were their own suffering, experiencing deep sorrow: One must not avoid hardship, whether day or night, through cold and heat, hunger and thirst, or fatigue, but must wholeheartedly rush to assist, without the intention of seeking recognition or reputation. In this way, one can truly be a great physician for the people; if one deviates from this, they are akin to a great thief of sentience. Throughout history, esteemed figures have treated illnesses, often risking their lives to aid those in dire straits. Although one may claim to value human life over that of animals, in the face of danger, life is ultimately one and the same. To benefit oneself at the expense of others is a shared suffering of all beings; how much more should this apply to humans? Killing for the sake of survival only distances one further from life. The reason why I do not use life as medicine today is precisely because of this understanding.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a></p></div>

<p>For a great physician, one must achieve a tranquil mind, able to introspect, and look upon the situation with a serene demeanor, expansive and free, not shining bright nor drearily dim, thoroughly inspecting symptoms and illnesses, with deep intention and careful observation, missing no detail.

This is a shared shame among humans and gods, something that the truly wise would never do—this is the essence of the healer&#39;s intention. </p>
<p>As for the practice of medicine, one must not speak too much, jest, chatter, argue about right and wrong, discuss people, flaunt one’s fame, disparage other doctors, or boast of one&#39;s own virtue.

The Book of Changes states: &quot;If it is not the utmost mystery of the world, who can engage with it?&quot; Observing today&#39;s physicians, they do not contemplate and seek the essence of the classics to expand their understanding. Rather, each follows their traditional skills, clinging to old methods from beginning to end. When diagnosing illnesses or asking about symptoms, they focus on verbal responses, relying only on brief interactions. They apply remedies without thorough examination, taking superficial measurements that do not capture the whole condition; they check the pulse without understanding its depth, dismiss the body&#39;s currents, and disregard important signs. Often, they do not reach fifty proper assessments, and are unaware of crucial diagnoses, lacking a comprehensive view, merely peering through a tube. The challenge of distinguishing life from death is indeed difficult. Should not patients be vigilant about recognizing these shortcomings in their physicians to guard against negligence? Throughout history, physicians have harbored jealousy and malice towards one another; the case of Bian Que, who was harmed by Li Shizhen, the chief physician of the Qin dynasty, exemplifies this. When one physician prescribes, they must not allow another physician to collaborate improperly, risking the addition of harmful substances that would exacerbate the illness, leading to suffering. Such instances are not uncommon; hence, caution is essential.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>It is better to not take medicine and accept the natural order than to have foolish doctors compete, endangering lives—this is indeed tragic. Diagnosing patients is not easy; knowing the conditions through inquiry distinguishes the skilled doctors. Zhang Zhongjing said: &quot;Anyone wishing to harmonize decoctions, herbs, and acupuncture techniques must engage in deep thought. One must understand the twelve meridians, identify the three hundred sixty-five acupoints, recognize the flow of vital energy, and discern the location of diseases—the methods of treatment must be understood.&quot; In ancient times, the highest physicians observed colors. The colors, pulses, and forms must not be disconnected. When black dominates red, it leads to death; when red dominates blue, it leads to life. Chinese medicine considers sounds, correlating them to the five tones. Fire perceives water’s sound, leading to anxiety and fright; wood perceives metal’s sound, leading to fear of punishment. The spleen represents earth; it nurtures all things, supports all around. In favorable conditions, it is unseen; in death, it reverts to it. Excessive activation leads to immobility of limbs, while deficiency leads to blocked orifices and closed senses, akin to a person inebriated. The four seasons circulate, ending and beginning anew. Lower physicians diagnose pulses and understand disease origins, observing the flows and shifts through the seasons, knowing their interrelations—this is the essence of mastery.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Diagnosing Illness</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, those skilled in medicine were categorized as follows: the highest physicians treat the state, the middle physicians treat the people, and the lowest physicians treat diseases. Furthermore, it is said that the highest physicians listen to sounds, the middle physicians observe colors, and the lowest physicians diagnose pulses. Additionally, the highest physicians treat diseases that have yet to emerge, the middle physicians treat diseases that are desired to emerge, and the lowest physicians treat diseases that are already present. If one does not carefully apply themselves and allow confusion to arise, it becomes difficult to save the patient. </p>
<p>Foolish physicians do not understand the three divisions, nine pulses, and the principles of the four seasons. They may incorrectly use decoctions or medicines and misapply acupuncture, leading to more ailments, resulting in their demise. Alas, the masses suffer, and half die unjustly; it can be said that there are no good physicians in the world. These practitioners fail to explain the classics regarding the interplay of earth, water, fire, and wind, which together create human life. However, foolish physicians do not consider the pulse pathways and incorrectly treat ailments, causing the internal organs and their five elements to conflict with one another, like pouring oil on a raging fire—this cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>In all matters, the four Qi must harmonize, and the four spirits must be at peace. If one Qi is out of balance, a hundred diseases arise; if the four spirits are disturbed, four hundred and four diseases emerge simultaneously. It is also said: one hundred diseases may heal on their own without treatment; one hundred diseases require treatment to heal; one hundred diseases may be difficult to cure even with treatment; one hundred diseases will lead to true death if untreated.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Notes from Dongpo</strong> by Su Shi (Song Dynasty)</p>
<p>Regarding seeking medical treatment and pulse diagnosis</p>
<p>The difficulty in reading pulses has been a longstanding issue through the ages. When the pulse is thin yet has substantial indicators, and when it shows strong signs but is frail, even a slight difference can make the distinction between life and death, fortune and misfortune. This has been a problem throughout history. One cannot avoid consulting a physician, yet truly skilled practitioners are very few. Exceptional horses are rare indeed, as the world has never seen one that did not need to be ridden; likewise, outstanding physicians do not appear often, and patients do not die in vain, as it is due to their strengths that they guard against their weaknesses. Many local doctors hold secret knowledge of the ailments and seek consultations to test the abilities of the physicians, thereby making the diagnosis a wandering search through uncertainty, distinguishing the real from the false amidst suspicion. If the physician unfortunately fails, they still do not acknowledge their failure, resorting to clever embellishments to preserve their reputation; yet, if no recovery is achieved, they say it was indeed difficult to treat. Occasionally, some are diligent and wish to improve, but even if they refer to the words of the patient, they still mix in their own observations, balancing both, leading to ineffective remedies; this is a universal problem of our time that remains unrecognized. Throughout my life, when I sought medical help, I generally observed their skill or lack thereof during normal times. When I did fall ill and sought treatment, I would first fully disclose my ailments, then request a diagnosis. By letting the physician clearly understand the source of the problem first, the matters of deficiency and excess, heat and cold, would be determined beforehand, hence the doubts of the pulse could not confuse. Therefore, even with traditional medicine, my ailments always improved. My only goal was to recover from my illness; I did not seek to trouble the physician.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The physician prescribes medicine based on intention.</p>
<p>Ouyang Wenzhong once remarked that a patient, when asked about the cause of his illness, said: &quot;I was on a boat and encountered strong winds, which startled me and led to my condition.&quot; The physician then used a long-standing remedy: he took a tooth from a long-standing tree, cut it where it was moist with sweat from the boatman’s hands, mixed it with cinnabar and substances like Poria, and the patient recovered after drinking it. Now, according to the &quot;Pharmaceutical Notes,&quot; citing the &quot;Discussion on Medicinal Properties,&quot; it states that to stop sweating, one should take the root of Ephedra and grind it with ancient bamboo leaves to consume. Wenzhong noted that physicians often rely heavily on cooking and using medicines in this manner. Initially, it seemed trivial like child’s play; however, it sometimes proved effective, though it is difficult to challenge that assertion. I then said: &quot;If you nourish scholars with ink and burnt ash, should they not be cured of laziness? Broadening this perspective, one could say that drinking the washing water of Boyi can cure greed, eating the remnants of Bigan&#39;s dish can end flattery, licking the shield of Fan Kuai can heal cowardice, and touching the earrings of Xi Shi can alleviate wickedness.&quot; He then laughed heartily. On the seventeenth day of the eighth month in the third year of the Yuanyou era, while sailing into the boundary of Yingzhou, I sat and recalled twenty years ago when I saw Wenzhong here, and casually recorded this moment of conversation and laughter.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a></p></div>

Zizhan was intrigued by this and wrote a preface, comparing it to Sun Simiao’s San Jiansan, though he did not dare to criticize it too harshly. He included it in his work &quot;Shanghan Lun,&quot; and it gained widespread acceptance throughout the land.</p>
<p>However, the treatment was extremely precise; even the slightest error could lead to death in cases of typhus. If the medicine was misused, it would result in many deaths.

<p>The ancient methods were often successful for the wealthy, but many of the poor and lowly did not experience such outcomes; conversely, the folk remedies were often effective for the poor, while the wealthy found little success. I initially doubted this but eventually realized: wealthy people typically safeguard themselves carefully; when they fall ill, their ailments must develop gradually, arising from within before manifesting outward, and cannot be entirely resolved by the ancient methods alone. </p>
<p>The poor, however, quickly acquire sickness from fluctuations in temperature, humidity, hunger, fatigue, and rest. These are not necessarily genuine illnesses, and there is no need to deeply investigate the causes; so long as there is something present, anything can be treated, while the ancient methods and strict protocols may not align with them. </p>

If the issue was in the intestines or stomach, he would carefully dissect and cleanse, removing impurities, and then stitch up the wounds, applying a divine ointment. In four to five days, the wounds would heal, and within a month, the patient would be restored. This is indeed a matter of decisive action.

<p>The historian Sima Qian, in his account of Bian Que, discusses the notion that treating illness should not rely on medicinal liquids, terrain techniques, incisions, or carving the flesh. He refers to the ancient methods of treatment, not suggesting that Bian Que possessed such arts, but rather that the world has misconstrued this. The lifespan of every person, whether long or short, cannot hinge on the skill of a single physician. It may be unfortunate for one to fall ill and escape death, yet still be harmed by incompetent doctors. There is no malady that a physician cannot address to restore life when there is potential for recovery.</p>
<p>The texts on medicine are meant to address treatable ailments and prevent harm. Bian Que himself stated that a skilled physician can aid those who are naturally destined to live, implying that they can merely help that which is meant to survive. Therefore, instead of relying on foolish doctors who thrive on dubious curiosities and untested methods, one would be better served to gain knowledge of self-care and nurture their health during a peaceful and carefree time to prolong their natural life.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Caution in Using Medicine</strong>  </p>
<p>In the art of medicine, if one does not understand it from the heart and relies solely on books, they are unlikely to attain its wonderful subtleties. For example, the herb Zhu can affect the essence of limestone; according to the theory of limestone, if one consumes limestone, they must avoid Zhu for life. The various formulas that include limestone as the main ingredient but also contain Zhu are fundamentally contradictory, and I do not understand what this means! I have asked experienced doctors, yet none could explain its significance. The theory of limestone states that although the stone pillars are warm, their substance is inherently heavy and can only become effective after being steamed and thinned out. Therefore, if one consumes a large quantity of the stone, it tends to steam itself; but if additional medicine is used to touch it, the effect will certainly be intensified. Just as a small fire must be fanned by the wind to ignite, a strong fire can be harmed by excessive fanning; this is a principle of nature. Hence, Sun Simiao stated: &quot;The five stone powder is highly toxic; it is better to eat wild kudzu than to use the five stones. When encountering this formula, one must burn it to avoid the dangers of consumption.&quot; He also said: &quot;People should not take stones; otherwise, all affairs will be unwell; with stones in the body, all things will be futile.&quot;<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a></p></div>

I ponder the case of Xihua Maimen Stone Gypsum, which is guarded and not passed down; such intentions are selfish, and a gentleman would be accountable for this. In the past, Zhao Gongxuan taught Ji Xiu, who came to preside over Longquan. He hurriedly advanced but suffered from a nosebleed, losing several sheng daily. At that time, his elder brother advised him to take lotus root juice and Rehmannia paste. Zhao consulted various physicians, and one said: This is a cautionary remedy. He changed doctors several times, all to no avail. His elder brother secretly provided the juice, and after three days of taking it, he recovered. His brother said: This is the formula presented earlier. Zhao was astonished and said: If it were not for the deceptive tactics of non-medical people misleading me, had I trusted this remedy sooner, would I have endured this suffering for so long? Now, I have tested and verified repeatedly—there are things that should not be exchanged. For instance, if vomiting stems from heat toxins affecting the heart, one should use Neituo San, also known as Wanjin San. If vomiting arises from weak spleen and stomach, one should use Jiazhu San. For heat toxins causing swelling and pain, Maimen Stone Gypsum should be used.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a></p></div>

It is not that there are no formulas in the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; If one insists on using ancient formulas to treat contemporary illnesses, it is akin to dismantling an old house to match a new one.

<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Use of Medicine</strong> (by Li Gao from the Yuan Dynasty)</p>
<p>The method of using medicine emphasizes clarity and flexibility. Just as the wind may differ from ancient to modern times, the qualities of the land vary between the north and south, the timing of weather transforms with seasons, one’s constitution can be thick or thin, the nature of illnesses can be new or old, age distinctions exist between the young and the old, and social status defines the rich and the poor. When administering medicine, one should not be overly curious, nor should one cling to singular notions, be reckless, or act hastily. Caution and precision are essential; one must be adaptable and flexible, allowing for deep contemplation to ensure effectiveness. It is a lament that earlier sages did not articulate these principles, leaving later scholars ill-informed, thus leading to widespread confusion.</p>
<p>Illnesses may require tonics, which should be addressed with purging methods. Conversely, some illnesses may need purging, which must then be treated with tonics. If a condition calls for cold medicine, one should initiate treatment with heat; if warmth is needed, cold medicines should lead the way. Conditions located above should be treated from below, while those below should be treated from above. An illness may manifest in similar ways yet require different medicines, or it may present uniquely while responding to the same treatment. The subtleties are numerous, and scholars would do well to investigate deeply.</p>
<p>The primary prohibition in using medicine lies in the desire for speed. Aiming for rapid results can lead to improper application of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness in treatment, risking adverse outcomes without achieving any benefits. Medicine must be administered in proper order, just as soldiers must follow discipline. Even the bravest generals achieve success through proper strategies. It is also like untangling threads; a gentle approach can clear the knots, while haste only tightens them further.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></p></div>

<p>Since the time of Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor, although there have been many famous doctors, how many can truly be learned from? Consider the abdominal surgeries by the Hua family and the acupuncture of the Wang family; their techniques are indeed remarkable, but how can later generations emulate them? They are not like the sacred classics of Qibo, the fire cautery of Lei Gong, the herbal formulas of Yi Zhi, the &quot;Hong Fan&quot; of Jizi, the challenging questions from the Yue people, the &quot;Shang Han&quot; of Zhang Zhongjing, the &quot;Pulse Diagnosis&quot; of Shu He, the &quot;Jia Yi&quot; of Shi An, the annotations of Qiyuanzi, or the discussions of Qian Zhongyang. All these represent live practices that can be learned. Can extensive discussions and numerous formulas that merely validate what later generations see ever compare? Among them, those who are virtuous and accomplished, extraordinary talents and individuals, along with those who exist in high positions yet remain humble in obscurity, while they may have observable methods or principles, none give rise to lasting practices that can endure for centuries. Is it that I wish to quibble? No, I only wish for learners to look up to these sages and know whom to aspire to.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Sanitary Treasure: Medical Treatment by Fortune</strong><br><strong>(Yuan Dynasty, Luo Tianyi)</strong></p>
<p>In the autumn of the year Bingchen, a twenty-seven-year-old son of Mr. Jia from Chuqiu County fell ill with exhaustion in all four limbs, excessive heat and sweating, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, coughing with phlegm, discomfort in the chest, constipation, and a gaunt appearance. Over one year, he consulted several doctors without recovery. Some said: &quot;The skilled doctor is not as good as the lucky doctor.&quot; Although a certain doctor may not be proficient in prescriptions or aware of pulse conditions, he has treated numerous conditions with success, earning him the title of &quot;Fortune Doctor.&quot; </p>
<p>There is a saying: &quot;Even if you can read Wang Shuhe&#39;s texts, it’s not as good as my experience with many cases.&quot; This is rather credible, so I decided to try him. The doctor arrived, examined his pulse, and said: &quot;I am very familiar with this illness; treatment will surely be effective.&quot; He applied moxibustion on the points of the lungs three times seven, and used a formula of Pinellia and bitter orange to resolve phlegm and eliminate stagnation. After a few doses, the stool became excessively loose, causing abdominal pain and loss of appetite, which further escalated the weakness.</p>
<p>The son told his father that he had been ill for a long time and was unable to tolerate the medicine. The illness worsened, and he eventually died. During the winter, upon returning from military service, his father informed me, and I said: “The Inner Canon states: when the form and energy are insufficient, the disease&#39;s energy is also lacking; both yin and yang are deficient, and purging will exacerbate this insufficiency. When both yin and yang are depleted, the blood and energy are all exhausted, the five organs are empty, the bone marrow is dried out; the elderly will perish, and the young will find no recovery. Thus, it is said that insufficiency must be replenished; this is the principle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a prolonged illness resulting in emaciation indicates a deficiency in form; shortness of breath signifies a lack of energy; feelings of restlessness and an urge to lie down, along with languid limbs and a tendency to avoid speech, indicate that both energy and blood are deficient.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To supplement is to fear it may not be enough; instead, a small toxic remedy is used to purge, which makes the deficiency even more profound, weakening further. If not dead, what awaits? Duke Jia sighed and left. I sensed the matter and briefly explained its reasoning. A great physician, in curing illness, must first examine the seasonal excesses or deficiencies affecting the patient&#39;s condition, observe differences in their blood, energy, diet, and temperament. Diseases may vary in vacuity or repletion, their profundity, depending on the meridians or organs involved; medicines have hierarchies among sovereign, minister, assistant, and envoy, with variations in size and peculiarities. Treatments vary as to urgency and the principles of application and correction. Master Sun said: In all matters of great medicine, one must be well-versed in &quot;Jia Yi&quot;, the &quot;Suwen&quot;, the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;, &quot;Mingtang Liu Zhu&quot;, the twelve meridians, the three divisions and nine indications, the five viscera and six organs, the surface and interior points, the nature of medicinal substances, the doctrines of Zhang Zhongjing and Sun Simiao, and also profoundly understand the five elements and yin-yang theory; mastery of the &quot;Zhouyi&quot; is essential. Only thus can one be considered a great physician.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Treating the Ill Before They Fall Ill</strong></p>
<p>Rather than trying to cure illness after it has occurred, it is better to nurture health before illness arises. Indeed, to administer medicine only after the onset of disease is futile. Thus, the practice of treating illness after it has developed is the way of doctors, while preventing illness before it arises is the essence of the principles of health preservation. If one anticipates and prevents troubles, what troubles could there be? This is the intent of the wise, who do not treat existing illness but address the unseen. For instance, one prepares earth to prevent water; if one does not block the trickling flow, the flood cannot be contained. One prepares water to combat fire; if one does not extinguish the flickering flame, the raging fire cannot be stopped. Since it is difficult to contain a surge of water or fire, how much more so for a disease already established? Therefore, one should go to bed early and rise early in the spring to prevent illness, and similarly, early rising and late resting in summer promotes health. These routines calms the body and tempers anger, enabling the fulfillment of one&#39;s ambitions, while embracing cooling and light foods to nourish vitality. Thus act the wise in the spring and summer, treating illness before it arises.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In the bright autumn, one must wait for sunlight in the hidden winter to gather the spirit, conceal aspirations, and keep one&#39;s intentions private; to nourish the yin with warming and hot food. This is how the sage treats illness before it arises in autumn and winter. Some say: to address a liver ailment, one must first strengthen the spleen; only then can the wood pathogen not spread. To address redness in the right cheek, one must first drain the heat from the lung meridian; only then can the metal pathogen not become dominant. This is indeed the method for preventing illness.</p>
<p>Now, to harmoniously adjust the spirit according to the four seasons as a means of preventing illness, what might this mean? To preserve one’s health and longevity is the path of the sage; to treat illnesses thoroughly is the skill of the superior practitioner. The discourse on treating illness only after it has occurred, in relation to the adjustment of the spirit in different seasons, carries a profound intention! In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor and the Heavenly Master had extensive exchanges where they never neglected nourishment; they first discussed innate nature, then the adjustment of spirit, applying principles of yin and yang followed by seasonal adjustments. They emphasized moderation in diet and regularity in daily activities, earnestly prioritizing health care, intending to prevent potential illnesses rather than react to severe diseases that are hard to remedy.</p>
<p>Later, the Qin state was slow to understand this principle. When the Duke of Jin experienced a serious ailment in the diaphragm, he was told: It cannot be treated. Bian Que understood this well; he diagnosed the Duke of Qi’s illness, which had reached the marrow, and declared: It cannot be saved. Alas! It is regrettable that the lords of Qi and Jin did not grasp the principles of preventing illness.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Examining the Pathology of Disease Without Losing the Correspondence to Qi</p>
<p>Evil Qi has its own specific origins, often tracing back to its essentials; therapeutic methods also have their corresponding conclusions, which should be preventively handled. The essence of treating disease lies in thoroughly understanding its sources first; if one does not comprehend the direction of the therapeutic principles, one is likely to err. Therefore, the emergence of disease, due to its multitude, does not transcend the Five Movements and Six Qi. If one can carefully examine and discern its critical points, then apply treatment accordingly, ensuring each aligns with the appropriateness of the Qi and seasons, one will not have even the slightest oversight. If so, the path to treating illness and finding its origins will be commendable. The Treatise on the True Essentials states: &quot;Examine the pathology of disease without losing the correspondence to Qi,&quot; implying deep meaning. It is often said that the essence of medical practice can be summed up in one phrase: it is the movements and Qi. Heaven represents Yang, while Earth represents Yin.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The two forces of Yin and Yang are each divided into three categories, known as the Three Yin and Three Yang. However, the heavens are not purely Yang; they also have Three Yin, while the earth is not purely Yin; it also has Three Yang. Therefore, both heaven and earth, above and below, have the six forces of wind, heat, fire, dampness, dryness, and cold that circulate and move between them, together with the five elements of wood, fire, metal, and water. Human beings exist within this, and the organs and energy points flow in correspondence with heaven and earth. Thus, one realizes that the origin of various diseases stems from this mechanism. However, how should medicine treat these conditions? One must carefully observe these phenomena to ensure nothing is overlooked before proceeding. For instance, all dizziness caused by wind relates to the liver and wood; all pains, ulcers, and itching pertain to the heart and fire; all swelling and fullness due to dampness relate to the spleen and earth; all stagnation of qi concerns the lungs and metal; and all contraction and withdrawal due to cold pertains to the kidneys and water—these disease mechanisms belong to the five elements.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a></p></div>

This discussion of the pathological mechanisms relates to the six qi. The investigation of these mechanisms, while appearing to be thorough, cannot overlook the details in treating diseases. Therefore, it is essential to differentiate between yin and yang amidst confusion, and to discern the root and branches in subtle situations. For those who differ in existence and non-existence, seek the reasons for their differences; for those who differ in deficiency and excess, identify the reasons for their variations. Use sweat-inducing, vomiting, or purging methods according to appropriateness; apply hot, cold, warm, or cool treatments as required. Some may be countered to control subtle manifestations, while others follow to guide the more severe cases. Address higher matters by addressing the offenders of the qi from afar, tackle middle matters by discerning the transformations of seasonal changes, and handle lower matters by assessing southern and northern appropriateness. Ensure that larger and smaller matters are balanced, and that actions are timely and proportional; this is the basis of treatment.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Is it not the case that there are significant failures in deviation and disorder? Furthermore, examining the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; it states: to treat illness, one must seek its root. The &quot;Herbal Classic&quot; states: to cure a sickness, one must first understand the mechanism of the illness. This is the essence of understanding the illness mechanism. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Six Primary Elements&quot; posits: do not disregard natural signs, and do not oppose vital energies. The &quot;Great Treatise on the Five Constant Elements&quot; states: one must first consider seasonal energies and not disrupt the harmony of nature. All of this reflects the importance of understanding vital energies. Thus, the texts of the &quot;Plain Questions&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; consistently emphasize the significance of vital energies. It has been stated: first determine the year to clarify its energies; and there is also a caution that those treating illness must understand heavenly principles, geographical factors, and the dynamics of yin and yang. Another statement asserts: without knowledge of the year’s progression, the rise and fall of energies, and the origin of deficiency and excess, one cannot be effective as a practitioner. These warnings are earnest, as though the sages had an unmanageable concern, illustrating that the essence of medical practice rests completely in these principles. Observing the &quot;Treatise on Origination of Illness,&quot; which categorizes and compares phenomena, reveals a profound understanding of the transformation of vital energies. This understanding is crucial for grasping the principles of illness mechanisms and vital energies.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The ability to harmonize color and pulse enables complete understanding.</p>
<p>To know what is within, one should observe the outside; diagnosis from the outer reveals the inner. What exists within manifests outwardly. If one does not correlate these aspects, understanding the nature of disease—whether it is progressing or regressing—cannot be achieved. A skilled practitioner illuminates the principles deeply, thus looking at the five colors: blue, yellow, red, white, and black, to relate them to the pulses of the five organs, exploring their responses and lack thereof; feeling the urgency, size, slackness, and depth of the five pulses, to associate them with the colors of the organs, determining alignment or misalignment. If one can truly perceive the subtle colors, diagnose the delicate pulses, and correlate the inner and outer aspects for treatment, then success in all endeavors can be achieved effortlessly. The &quot;Suwen&quot; states: the ability to harmonize color and pulse can lead to complete success. This is its meaning. </p>
<p>The essence of the Dao is a unified qi, divided into yin and yang, dispersed into the five elements, all of which are possessed by humans. The five pulses are true to a person, circulating blood and qi, connecting yin and yang, nourishing the body; the five colors are the expressions of qi, corresponding to the five elements, aligning with the four seasons, illuminating the face.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Medical Methods</strong></p>
<p>The discussions by the Qian family, as well as &quot;Living People,&quot; Wang Chaofeng, and Wang Defu, all originate from the Song dynasty, while Yi Lao and Shouzhen come from the Jin dynasty. The various medicines they used, differing in warmth and coolness, primarily derive from these sources. When reading these several books and applying their principles, one must also consider the appropriateness for the locality and the generations. However, nothing is better than taking principles from the pure ancients and synthesizing them with the formulas of Zhongjing, for this constitutes the unchanging great law for all ages.</p>
<p><strong>On Ancient Formulas</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and &quot;Questions of the Simple&quot; are reputedly the dialogues between the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo. Observing their meanings, they are clearly not the words of just one time, nor solely the work of one person. Liu Xiang attributed them to the sons of the various Han lords, while Chengzi said they originated at the end of the Warring States period. Their general ideas are akin to how &quot;The Book of Rites&quot; was compiled by Han scholars and transmitted along with the words of Confucius and Zisi. The &quot;Secret of the Linglan,&quot; &quot;Principles of the Five Constants,&quot; and &quot;Chronicle of the Six Origins,&quot; among other texts, merely elucidate the principles of yin, yang, and the five elements that govern existence, aligning symbols with virtues. They are directly applicable to the human body. The various colors, pulses, diseases, names, acupuncture points, and treatments all expand upon these principles. Similarly, Huangfu Mi&#39;s &quot;Jia Yi&quot; and Yang Shangshan&#39;s &quot;Tai Su&quot; are both based on this, albeit with slight differences. The overarching principles that medical practitioners must adhere to are found within these texts.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>According to the &quot;Bibliography of Arts and Literature&quot; from the Western Han Dynasty, there are eighteen volumes of the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; as well as two &quot;Inner Canons&quot; by Bian Que and the Bai family, totaling three versions; however, the title of &quot;Suwen&quot; is not listed. It wasn&#39;t until the Sui Dynasty&#39;s &quot;Catalogue of Classics&quot; that the name &quot;Suwen&quot; first appeared, and it was not identified as part of the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; During the Tang Dynasty, Wang Bing made annotations based on the nine volumes of &quot;Jiu Ling,&quot; connecting them with the numbers in the Han record and also included discussions on Yin and Yang, claiming them to be the writings of his teacher, Zhang Gong, to compensate for what was lost. His efforts were indeed diligent. Unfortunately, there was a confusion of red and black ink, mixing precious stones and ordinary rocks, and the interpretations suffered from excessive leniency, with some references being rather inaccurate. Later in the Song Dynasty, scholars like Lin Yi and Gao Ruone corrected the erroneous texts and filled in the missing meanings, greatly benefiting Wang Bing&#39;s work. Now, in each section, noticing connections with the classics, I still quote passages and interpret them with my own understanding, hoping to engage in discussion with colleagues, not daring to carelessly criticize the earlier scholars.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Pivot&quot; are not recorded in the catalogs of the Han, Wei, and Tang dynasties. In the Sui dynasty, there were nine volumes of the &quot;Needle Classic,&quot; and in the Tang dynasty, there were only the &quot;Spirit Treasure Annotations&quot; and the twelve volumes of the &quot;Yellow Emperor&#39;s Nine Spirits.&quot; Some say Wang Bing renamed the &quot;Nine Spirits&quot; to &quot;Spiritual Pivot,&quot; and it is said that the &quot;Nine Spirits&quot; is particularly detailed regarding needles, which is why Huangfu Mi referred to it as the &quot;Needle Classic,&quot; corresponding to the nine volumes of the &quot;Needle Classic&quot; recorded in the Sui catalogs. If it is indeed a singular work with two names, there should not be an additional eleven or twelve volumes of the &quot;Needle Classic&quot; emerging in the Tang dynasty. The so-called &quot;Spirit Treasure Annotations&quot; are notes from Bian Que, the Supreme Source Lord, which have rarely been transmitted through the ages. In the late Song dynasty, there was a one-volume &quot;Brief of the Spiritual Pivot,&quot; which has also become lost. At the beginning of Shaoxing, Shi Song compiled this work into twelve volumes, restoring it to its former state, and compared to other editions, it is quite good.

The book was burned by the First Emperor of Qin, and it did not include medical formulas and divination, thus it was still able to be completely transcribed. When it suffered during the migration of Emperor Xian of Han and the chaos of Jin Huai, literary works were consumed by fire, and only rare remnants survived. What exists now are these three volumes of the original text, yet the counties and regions they mention are mostly from the Later Han period, casting doubt that they were recorded by Zhang Zhongjing and Hua Yuanhua. The original text listed only 365 types of medicine, which were then annotated and divided into seven volumes. During the Tang Dynasty, Li Yingong&#39;s achievements and Su Gong&#39;s references led to an addition of 114 types, dividing it into twenty volumes, commonly referred to as &quot;Tang Ben Cao.&quot; In the Song Dynasty, Liu Han and others further supplemented it with 220 types commonly used by physicians. The false Shu figure Meng Chang also ordered his minister Han Baosheng and others to refer to the Tang &quot;Tu Jing&quot; to expand it, which became known as &quot;Shu Ben Cao.&quot;<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a></p></div>

In modern times, Chen Yan compiled &quot;A Compendium of Materia Medica,&quot; and Wang Haogu produced &quot;A Guide to Decoctions,&quot; both of which aimed to simplify previous complexities. I privately believe that the records of prefectures and counties have differed between ancient and modern times, and there are cases where one thing has different names based on its roots and sprouts, or where the same name applies to diverse qualities.

It is set up as a dialogue to demonstrate to scholars, and many of the cited words are not from the texts of &quot;Ling&quot; or &quot;Su&quot;, as these ancient works have been lost to time. During the Sui Dynasty, there was a commentary by Lu Bowang, which did not spread; in the Song Dynasty, Wang Wei Yi compiled interpretations from five schools, but there were inconsistencies among them. Only the interpretations of the Yu family can be regarded as somewhat substantial. Ji Qiqing&#39;s commentary is rather detailed, but it mainly refutes the views of Yang Yuancao, Lu Guang, and Wang Zongzheng. Zhou Zhongli made several revisions, yet his investigations were not thorough. Li Ziye provided explanations at the sentence level but offered no insights. In modern times, Zhang Jiege added ancient evidence and prescriptions that are not particularly relevant to the original text. Wang Shaoqing elaborated on his views, naming it &quot;Chongyuan&quot;, but it was also insufficient to reveal the depths of earlier scholars&#39; thoughts. I have tried to compile the strengths of various schools, first explaining the terms and then interpreting the intentions, and I have humbly added my own comments in between for the convenience of future learners, but I do not dare to claim it as definitive.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Duke of Jin, Wang Shuhe, initially based his work on earlier theories and then reorganized and compiled them anew. Following him, Song Chengwuj, made annotations on this work. Later, figures such as Pang Anchang, Zhu Gong, Xu Shuwei, Han Dihe, and Wang Shizhi also elaborated on these ideas, but fundamentally, none of them went beyond the four methods of sweating, warming, and so forth. Indeed, each diagnosis corresponds to a specific remedy, and in thousands of years, it seems harmonious, pointing towards the ancestors of various prescriptions, which is certainly true. What can be lamented is the reliance on the familial sayings of Wang regarding the diagnosis of the three yin, which are frequently undifferentiated. Furthermore, the accounts of Zhang and Wang often mix the past and present, creating confusion. Without a thorough and thoughtful engagement with each character and phrase, it’s unlikely anyone can grasp the profound meanings. Chen Wuze once supplemented the medicinal prescriptions for the three yin in the &quot;Three Causes Treatise,&quot; and his intention can indeed be perceived. Recently, Xu Zhishan composed &quot;Supplementing the Lost of Cold Damage,&quot; which unfortunately may not align with the views of earlier scholars. Therefore, I have taken the liberty to present key points to supplement what Cheng&#39;s work lacks, hoping that the worthy physicians may find it useful.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a></p></div>

It serves as a pivotal reference for the medical field, differing from modern interpretations and methods.

<p>The &quot;Secret Words of the Original Pearl,&quot; a ten-volume work, is presented by Qiyuanzi.

The title &quot;Secret Words of the Original Pearl&quot; refers to the teachings passed down privately by the Original Pearl Master.

Although it is not Wang&#39;s work, it still has some insights regarding the &quot;Suwen,&quot; particularly in the ninth and twenty-fourth volumes. I have compared the &quot;Suwen&quot; and found that the secret writings therein discuss the theory of the six qi and do not match at all with the volumes referenced by the Gao family, leading me to suspect that the transmitted versions contain errors. Tracing back to its origins, it likely compiles the subtle meanings of the &quot;Neijing&quot; and the fundamental essentials of five essays, along with essential words from the &quot;Tian Yuan Yu Ce,&quot; mingled with miscellaneous theories. The records of qi movements and auspices may not be reliable, and it is indeed a spurious text. If the original author made a separate compilation, it would surely have been known to the world; it would not merely address the aspect of qi movements.

Pu is his disciple, and it should be a compilation of his own. I suspect that these writings could not have been produced by individuals of the Pu lineage; rather, the Deng family merely attached a separate formula and renamed it. The reason the formula includes the &quot;Taiping&quot; coins and &quot;mountain yam&quot; is because &quot;Taiping&quot; was the era name in the early years of Song Xiling, and &quot;yams&quot; were initially named &quot;mountain yams&quot; to avoid a later taboo.

<p>The chapters on the Path and proper governance can truly benefit political affairs and enlighten many skilled workers.

Both flaws and merits exist, yet they do not diminish the value of fine jade.</p>
<p>In discussing the various physicians, it is said: Bian Que&#39;s medicine was like Qin’s lamp illuminating objects—beauty and ugliness are evident, and akin to Yi Qi’s encounters with opponents, each move could be strategic, yet observers could not discern his divine skills. Cang Gong’s medicine resembles a wheel with a skilled hand, adeptly working without the need for clever words. Zhang Changsha was like the teacher of Tang and Wu, adhering strictly to the royal way; his strategies in offense and defense were uniquely effective, capable of overcoming any enemy regardless of size.</p>

The works of these two scholars are indeed classics that endure through the ages. Subsequently, Chao Yuanfang wrote &quot;On the Sources of Disease,&quot; and Wang Bing composed &quot;The Jade Strategies of Heaven,&quot; both of which draw on ancestral teachings. However, Yuanfang spoke of wind and cold, and two types of dampness, while neglecting the concept of damp-heat, and Bing theorized about the changes of the five movements and six Qi, focusing on stagnation rather than flow, which were shortcomings. Later, during the Tang dynasty, Sun Simiao emerged with extraordinary insights and deep compassion for humanity, listing formulas in &quot;Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold,&quot; which enlightened preceding and succeeding scholars and greatly contributed to the medical field. At that time, Wang Tao had &quot;The Secret Essentials of the Outer Chamber,&quot; discussing formulas and methods in detail; yet he stated that needles can end a life but cannot revive the dead, which represents a one-sided view.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Excerpt on Filial Piety in Medicine</strong></p>
<p>In Northern Qi, Li Yuanzhong’s mother was elderly and frequently ill. Yuanzhong dedicated himself to the art of medicine and studied diligently for many years, thus becoming proficient in this skill. His cousin, seeing his own mother suffer from illness, also sought to treat her and, when she did not recover, devoted himself to the study of acupuncture and herbal remedies, ultimately curing her. During the Sui Dynasty, Xu Daoyou also sought out medical texts due to his mother&#39;s ailments, and through extensive reading, gained profound knowledge, earning the title of famous physician. He advised his sons, saying: a son ought to be attentive to both diet and medicine; if he does not know the principles of treatment, can he truly be considered filial? This became a teaching passed down through generations.</p>
<p>Tang poet Wang Bo once stated that a son cannot be ignorant of medicine. At that time, there was a secret technique in Chang’an by Cao Yuan, which Bo learned about during his visits and obtained its essentials. What Bo encountered genuinely enhanced his understanding of the craft. In the Tang Dynasty, Wang Tao also learned medicine due to his mother’s illness and published his works in the world. In the Song Dynasty, Gao Ruone, motivated by his mother’s sickness, became well-versed in medical texts, so much so that even the eminent national physicians respected him. Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s Treatise on Cold Damage and Sun Simiao’s prescriptions along with &quot;Essentials of the External Respository&quot; had long been overlooked; he carefully examined and corrected their records for circulation. It was then understood that many renowned physicians originated from Weizhou, all learning from the Gao clan. This thus exemplifies the link between medicine and filial piety.</p>
<p>In the Song Dynasty, Li Xujì’s mother lost her eyesight. Xujì diligently licked her eyes daily without fail. After two years, her sight was restored. Li Xingjian’s father suffered from painful boils; Xingjian sucked the pus from them without spitting on the ground, and the illness soon settled. This further highlights the connection between filial piety and medicine.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Medicine</strong><br>By Wang Wenlu (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>Medicine is about intention. It involves understanding the timing of diseases and determining their causes, as well as establishing treatments, just as heavenly principles and sacred teachings may differ. In the Yuan dynasty, customs were extravagant, leading to rich tastes and a humid, hot environment, which often resulted in many illnesses. Therefore, Zhu Danxi was taught methods to clear heat and lower fire, distinguishing them from the warm tonifying methods of the “Formula for Harmonious Medicaments,” correcting excesses. However, while hot medicines of the &quot;Formula&quot; are certainly not permissible, relying solely on Danxi’s cold medicines is also not appropriate. Especially now, as the vital energy is increasingly depleted, treating with Danxi’s methods often harms the spleen and stomach. This is because phlegm arises from spleen dampness, heat from spleen deficiency, and it is imperative to employ the method of supplementing the spleen from Dongyuan as a principal approach. Thus, it is crucial for physicians to carefully discern the flow of vital energy, observe human conditions, and identify the origins of diseases.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>On Medicine&#39;s Origins</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked: &quot;The origins of medicine trace back to Xuandi and Qiyi, where medical practices gained recognition in the world, and several individuals authored texts for future generations to follow. How many have done this?&quot; I shall clarify this for you! I have read the writings of the scholar Song Gong Jinglian and have derived my understanding from them. Let me present it as follows: Although the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; is suspected to have been written by scholars of the pre-Qin period imitating earlier works, its arguments are profound and concise, its principles intricate and broad, and its examination and debate are credible and substantiated; it ought to serve as the foundational text for medical practitioners. Following this are the Qin and Yue people, represented by He Huan. He Huan left no texts to pass down, while the Yue people wrote the &quot;Eight-One Difficulties,&quot; which articulates and clarifies the essentials of the &quot;Neijing.&quot; Below them are Chunyu Yi and Hua Tuo. Tuo&#39;s manipulation of the bones certainly belongs to the realm of guiding techniques. As for his method of opening the abdomen and cleansing the stomach and intestines to remove sickness, this drifts into the supernatural.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Regarding the medical conditions described by Sima Qian, the &quot;Wei Feng&quot; and &quot;Ta Feng&quot; are conditions that modern people do not understand at all, let alone seek their deeper treatments. Furthermore, there are texts such as Zhang Ji&#39;s &quot;Jin Kui Yu Han Jing&quot; and various treatises on typhoid fever, which are indeed timeless classics that elaborate on injuries caused by the six qi, yet they neglect the ailments arising from improper desires related to food, drink, and labor, and their texts are also confusing and difficult to systematically analyze. Below this, we have Wang Shuhe, who compiled the writings of Qi Bo and Hua Tuo into the &quot;Mai Jing,&quot; discussing yin and yang, the internal and external, identifying the three divisions and nine pulses, distinguishing the person’s welcoming, qi, and mouth, and detailing the twelve meridians, as well as the diseases of the three burners, five organs, and six bowels, making it quite clear. Unfortunately, due to the superficial interpretations by ignorant men, the essence of this work has not flourished in the world. Following this, there is Chao Yuanfang. Although his later compilation &quot;Disease Sources&quot; may not be unobservant, it primarily discusses the two qi of wind and cold, without addressing the principles of dampness and heat, which is its shortcoming. Then we have Wang Bing, who proposed the changes in the five movements and six qi and wrote &quot;Tian Yuan Yu Ce,&quot; which is detailed and intricate, yet difficult for people to grasp; if one becomes muddled in it, they will be stagnant and unable to make progress.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The world classifies medicine through the lens of infants, how shallow is its understanding! The texts that have been lost, collected by Yan Xiaozhong, largely reflect his own intentions and are not the true essence of this knowledge. Below him are Zhang Yuan Su from Shanggu, Liu Wansuo from Hejian, and Zhang Congzheng from Suishui. Although Yuan Su and Wansuo created strange dreams and unusual figures to mystify their teachings, they actually rose in response to the trends of this knowledge. As for Congzheng, he is again aligned with Wansuo. </p>
<p>Yuan Su, using ancient methods to address modern ailments, found that they simply could not correlate; he treated diseases without relying on established formulas, which is why his writings have not been transmitted. Those that exist today are all later interpretations. His academic lineage is traced through Li Gao of Dongyuan, who absorbed these teachings deeply. </p>
<p>Gao clarified the inner and outer injuries and focused much on the theory of nourishing the spleen as the foundation. He believed that soil is the master of the body; when the soil is balanced, all organs are at peace. Congzheng advocated for treatments including inducing sweating, utilizing three methods, and addressed the six factors of wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, and fire as crucial to medicine. His approach often relied on aggressive treatment strategies, which, if misapplied by the unwise, could lead to death. </p>
<p>Wansuo discussed diseases of wind and fire, with the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; delineating the pathogen mechanisms in a way that is encapsulated in nineteen criteria forming the &quot;Original Disease Methods.&quot; The profound intricacies therein are not something the common physicians in great institutions can easily imitate.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a></p></div>

Luo Zhiti from Wulin and Zhu Yanxiu from Danxi both draw from the refined essence of their predecessors. Additionally, there are writers like Zhu Zuo from Taiwan and Hua Shou from Yue, whose contributions are numerous and not easily listed. Alas! Since the time of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; there have been 179 notable medical writers, 209 works, and 1,259 volumes in total, which is indeed quite a lot. However, when speaking of the most prominent physicians throughout the ages, how can one possibly enumerate them all? </p>

The response is: Can we speak of the trivial knowledge from the wilds? Yet medicine does not stop at the three generations; what, then, limits its texts to the three dynasties? We should only speak of what is legitimate and applicable. I have a fellow townsman, Mr. Zhu Yanxiu of Danxi, who inherited the teachings of the Liu, Zhang, and Li families, and found his foundation in the works of Luo Taiwuwei, thus his medical skills have resonated widely in the present era, with people far and near taking him as a model. As for me, I am fortunate to be a contemporary of Mr. Danxi, sharing the same hometown with my ancestor, Lord Chengzhai, and therefore I also benefit from his guidance, gaining a reputation for my skills. Thus, the family tradition that I inherit has a lineage. I can only feel regret that my talent is dull and insufficient, and I cannot elevate the legacy of my forebears; this is my sorrow. What more is there to say? Someone asked: The lifespan of a person, whether long or short, is predetermined by fate. Every life must have its flowering; this has been true since ancient times. How does medicine help? The response is: What is called fate refers to the original qi of heaven and earth, the parents. The father represents heaven, the mother represents earth. The essence of the father and the blood of the mother vary in their abundance and decline, therefore, the lifespan and early death of people also differ.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a></p></div>

External influences such as wind, cold, heat, and dampness, as well as internal injuries from hunger, overeating, or overwork, cannot be entirely governed by one&#39;s inherent vital energy. Thus, in ancient times, the divine farmer experimented with various herbs and created medicine to support the populace, allowing each to reach their natural lifespan. Nowadays, there are those who, despite rejecting physicians in favor of shamans, end up dying prematurely, showing no difference from those shackled by sheer rock walls! Some say that present-day fortune-tellers calculate destinies based on celestial bodies at the time of birth, with occurrences of life and death reflecting these stars in an orderly manner. However, using the parents&#39; vital energies as a measure of heavenly mandate may not be the most appropriate perspective.

They never advocate leaving everything to fate.

<p>Some ask: In ancient times, physicians had the discipline of spells and incantations; why is it not utilized today? I reply: The discipline of spells refers to the &quot;Su Wen&quot; healing methods. Established by the scholar Longshu, it pertains to techniques for transforming essence and spirit, capable of treating minor ailments. Sometimes, men and women entering temples become bewildered and ill, or they may encounter malevolent energies in mountains and valleys, presenting symptoms akin to drunkenness or confusion, which are caused by evil spirits attaching themselves. For all symptoms of mental distress, spells can be used to resolve confusion and restore peace. In ancient times, the spell methods of Longshu circulated widely, but today they have morphed into practices of sorcery, trickery, and manipulation, cheating the people. Alas! Malicious arts are employed by malicious individuals; those who understand the principles should not use them.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a></p></div>

<p>Someone asked: Among the writings of Zhang Zhongjing, Dongyuan, Hejian, and Danxi, which is superior? Which should one focus on studying? The answer is: One should primarily concentrate on the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; while broadly observing the teachings of the four masters; this way, there will be no faults. The &quot;Inner Canon&quot; is to medicine what the Six Classics are to Confucianism and Daoism, as it encompasses everything; the teachings of the four masters are like the &quot;Xue,&quot; &quot;Yong,&quot; &quot;Yue,&quot; and &quot;Meng,&quot; serving as steps to the Six Classics, and none can be omitted. There is no distinction of superiority or inferiority among the four works; rather, each elucidates one particular principle. Zhang Zhongjing, noting that the &quot;Inner Canon&quot; contains references to cold damage but lacks a comprehensive account of its variations and transformations, therefore authored his writings to elaborate on these changes.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Later generations have revered these teachings, and as they have been passed down for so long, the true essence has gradually been lost. They were used to address the ailments caused by heat and cold, leading to misguidance. Thus, the Hejian school emerged, beginning to elucidate methods for treating heat illnesses, and the Dongyuan school emerged, starting to clarify methods for treating internal injuries. The theories from Hejian are in line with the principles of the &quot;Neijing&quot; regarding the five movements and six energies; the teachings from Dongyuan align with the &quot;Neijing&quot; concerning diet and fatigue. It is not that Zhongjing was unaware of the relationship between heat illnesses and internal injuries, but rather that he had not covered these topics in his writings. When it comes to treating cold damage, both Hejian and Dongyuan strictly follow Zhongjing’s principles and dare not deviate. Later, Danxi synthesized the contributions of various physicians, elucidating conditions of Yin deficiency leading to fever and the many diseases resulting from damp heat and internal fire, also documenting these according to symptoms, ultimately just expounding upon the essential meanings of the &quot;Neijing&quot; and supplementing what previous sages had overlooked. Therefore, it is said: for external pathogens, one follows Zhongjing; for internal injuries, one follows Dongyuan; for heat disease, one employs Hejian; for miscellaneous ailments, one turns to Danxi. To integrate these approaches constitutes the comprehensive path of medicine. </p>
<p>Some may question: Zhongjing&#39;s prescriptions use very few medicinal ingredients, while Dongyuan’s often exceed twenty.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a></p></div>

Therefore, in Dong Yuan&#39;s case, it is acceptable to use more. If others emulate this excess, it can lead to confusion. Dong Yuan, like Han Xin in commanding troops, believes that more is better.

Yet, people in the southeast often consume pepper, ginger, and cassia without falling ill, while those in the northwest avoid spicy and warming foods. Why is this? It is said: Although the southeast is hot, the land is low and often damp, and spicy, warming foods and medicines can also help eliminate dampness; while the northwest, although cold, has high and dry terrain, thus spicy, warming foods and medicines can help combat dryness.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>To treat illnesses with medication, one must understand this principle! Master Danxi treats diseases without departing from the concepts of qi, blood, and phlegm, therefore the key to using medicine lies in three formulations: for qi, use the Four Gentleman Decoction; for blood, use the Four Substance Decoction; for phlegm, use the Erchen Decoction. Furthermore, he states that prolonged illness leads to stagnation, hence the necessity to adopt methods to treat stagnation, such as the Yueju Pill. It can be said that the three ailments of qi, blood, and phlegm often coexist with stagnation, whether stagnation arises from prolonged illness, illness causes prolonged stagnation, or misprescriptions lead to stagnation. Consequently, whenever I treat illnesses, I always incorporate methods for stagnation. If an ailment of qi accompanies stagnation, then add an herb to resolve stagnation to the Four Gentleman Decoction; the same applies for ailments of blood and phlegm. Therefore, these four methods are essential for treating illnesses with medicine. Master Danxi also notes that in recent times, many who treat diseases do not distinguish between qi and blood, merely noticing a deficiency in qi and then using ginseng and astragalus. This is indeed appropriate for qi deficiency; however, if it is blood deficiency, does this not bolster qi while depleting yin-blood? This is referred to as treating blood ailments with qi, which aggravates the depletion of blood and can lead to both qi and blood becoming deficient.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a></p></div>

In ancient times, it was said: when I am ill, if I write the character for death in front of my chest from time to time, all my thoughts will cease, and my heart will find peace, which is better than taking medicine. This is truly a supreme method. If one is not cautious in illness, then death is inevitable. Those who understand this principle can cultivate a clear mind and self-discipline, being attentive in all matters, and they can recover from illness. Otherwise, even with good medicine, there will be no remedy. People often encounter illness yet indulge in their emotions and recklessness, harming themselves; this shows they do not truly fear death. There are also those who, knowing they fear death, are afraid of others discovering it. They remain silent about their condition or feign a light attitude even when seriously ill to deceive others; this is knowing the fear of death yet inadvertently courting it, which is particularly absurd.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a></p></div>

Although the arguments in the pre-made prescriptions often contain many inaccuracies, Danxi has debated these points. Nevertheless, the formulas are all composed by renowned physicians, and their hierarchical structure, dosage, urgency, and proportions are generally accurate. Recently, the works of Dongyuan and Danxi have become popular, and contemporary doctors, noticing that they do not use ancient formulas, tend to imitate their practices and create their own prescriptions. However, lacking clarity on the properties of the medicines and not comprehending the reasoning behind the prescriptions, they end up causing confusion, with varied and troublesome symptoms arising, making it difficult to recognize and treat them. Furthermore, since different medicines have distinct flavors, for instance, Schisandra has a thick flavor, Dongyuan&#39;s prescription calls for five or six grains at a minimum and up to a dozen at most, whereas contemporary doctors may use two or three taels. Gypsum has a light flavor, thus Baihu Decoction uses half a tael, while modern doctors do not dare to use more.<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Just as the north is often cold and the south is often hot, the rivers and lakes are very humid, while Lingnan is prone to miasma. This is attributed to the prevalence of certain climatic influences, resulting in the rise of various diseases in these regions—not because northern diseases lack heat or southern diseases lack cold. Regarding the treatment of cold with heat and heat with cold, the principles are the same across the five directions; how could there be a difference between north and south? However, within human organs, fire occupies two places, while in the six atmospheric influences of heaven, heat accounts for three and a half parts. Therefore, illnesses in the world are characterized by more heat and less cold. This can be seen in the chapter on disease mechanisms in the &quot;Inner Canon.&quot; Additionally, the combination of dampness and heat often leads to many diseases. Since the writings of the Grand Minister have fallen into obscurity, the &quot;Jufang&quot; has resorted to the common use of damp-heat remedies. Hence, Danxi emerged to elucidate the teachings of the &quot;Inner Canon,&quot; clarify the biases of the &quot;Jufang,&quot; and discuss the diseases caused by the interplay of dampness and heat to address the inadequacies of previous scholars. Later generations, not understanding this, regarded the frequent use of bitter and cold medicines like qin, lian, zhi, and ye as appropriate for the south, which is a shallow interpretation!<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a></p></div>

<p><strong>Methods of Treatment - &quot;Suwen&quot;</strong></p>
<p>In treating illnesses, one must understand the natural laws and geographical conditions, as well as the strength and weakness of the person. It is essential to inquire about daily activities, diet, and extreme pleasures or sufferings. For illnesses originating from within, one must first address the internal causes before treating the external symptoms. Conversely, if the illness comes from external factors, one must first treat the exterior before addressing the interior. If internal and external do not interact, then treat the primary ailment. If urgency arises, treat the superficial symptoms; if the situation is more relaxed, treat the root cause first. Address the related causes before the primary ones. To alleviate urgent conditions, supplement the lower ones to control the upper, and for urgent cases below, supplement the upper to control the lower. For severe poisons, treat ten cases with six remedies; for moderate poisons, treat ten cases with seven remedies; for minor poisons, treat ten cases with eight remedies; and for non-toxic conditions, treat ten cases with nine remedies. It is essential to nourish and harmonize, waiting for recovery. These principles are all derived from the &quot;Suwen&quot; text and are essential knowledge for medical practitioners; they cannot be fully recorded here, so I summarize the key points to illustrate their essence.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Preface</strong></p>
<p>Medicine is one of the matters of the Confucian scholar, and it is unclear at what point it diverged into two paths. When one’s parents or close relatives fall ill, they entrust their care to others, allowing those without such kinship to take charge of life and death. If there is any mistake, the consequences could last a lifetime. Those who advocate for benevolence to others are unable to apply that same benevolence towards their parents; thus, they fall short in compassion. Friends unite through righteousness, willing to face difficulties, irrespective of the risk—be it water, fire, or warfare; hence, they do not hesitate in urgent matters, regardless of material loss, be it gold, jade, grain, or silk. When one is ill, they might say that they do not understand the ailment; then others claim to thoroughly understand and seek treatment that may not align, each offering conflicting opinions, leading to confusion and inability to discern correctly. They may only be able to address external wounds, yet cannot guide friends through life and death situations; therefore, they lack righteousness. They prioritize personal desires: longing for delicious food, insisting on fine clothing and ornaments, and being careful about offspring and lineage. Yet when sickness arises, they are oblivious, leaving matters to women, relatives, and friends, or to crazed shamans and blind fortune-tellers, and even in dire situations they fail to distinguish between correct and erroneous treatments; thus, they lack knowledge. Among the Five Constants, with three missing, it is imperative for a Confucian to also engage in medicine. Hence it is said: Medicine is one of the matters of the Confucian scholar.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Challenges of Medicine</strong></p>
<p>The Five Classics and Four Books, as well as military and national rites and clothing, if discussed with inconsistencies, are merely matters of conduct. However, when it comes to medicinal herbs and prescriptions, even a slight mistake can endanger life. A ruler of a thousand chariots or a wealthy leader of a hundred pieces of gold should surely think deeply and exercise caution. In the past, when Prince Xu served medicine without tasting it, he was charged with murdering his ruler. When Ji Kangzi offered medicine, Confucius expressed uncertainty, knowing well that medicine should not be taken lightly. During the Jin dynasty, a talented individual wished to revise the &quot;I Ching&quot; and various prescriptions, first discussing and debating the classics with Zunuo. Even with differences, they were not enough to damage moral teachings. However, when it comes to medicine, a minor error can lead to life or death; thus, future generations suffer greatly. How can we treat this lightly?</p>
<p><strong>The Essence of a Healer</strong></p>
<p>Any practitioner of medicine must have a general understanding of both ancient and contemporary knowledge, adhere to benevolence and righteousness, and eliminate the desire for fame and profit. One should dedicate oneself to relief and assistance. If this is achieved, one’s understanding will naturally become clear, and spiritual insights will come forth. Why then be anxious to seek fame and engage in petty profit? If not, how could one avoid the shame of Jiang who was too eager for reputation or of Hua Tuo who, despite his skills, met his demise?<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Physician&#39;s Restraint from Lust</strong></p>
<p>During the Xuanhe period, there was a scholar who suffered from a chronic illness and could not find a cure despite numerous treatments. A man named He Cheng was skilled in medicine. His wife requested to see him, leading him into a private chamber and said, “I have seen my husband suffer for a long time, and we have nearly sold everything we own to pay for his treatments. I am willing to offer myself in exchange.” He Cheng sternly replied, “Madam, why would you speak in such a manner? Please rest assured, I will treat your husband and achieve results; do not tarnish yourself in this way. If there exists no man who would issue punishment, certainly there will be retribution from gods and spirits.” Before long, the husband recovered. One night, He Cheng dreamt he entered a shrine, where a judge spoke to him, saying, “Your medical skills have succeeded. At a time of great urgency, you did not succumb to lust or greed. The Supreme Deity decrees you a reward of fifty thousand coins and a government official post.” A few months later, the Eastern Palace fell ill, and the imperial physicians could not cure it. An edict summoned grassroots doctors, and He Cheng responded, bringing medicine that ensured recovery. The court granted him the same official position and compensation as he had dreamt.</p>
<p><strong>The Hidden Physician</strong></p>
<p>The way of medicine has long existed. The healing of illnesses originates from the Yellow Emperor; discerning the flavors of countless herbs comes from Shen Nong; the concoction of decoctions is attributed to Yi Yin. These three sages alleviated the suffering of the common people and contributed to the nurturing of heaven and earth, thus their contributions to future generations are immensely significant. Among all the ages, those who delve deeply into this path are also disciples of the sages. Jia Yi stated: &quot;The sages of old did not dwell in the court; they must have hidden themselves among physicians and diviners.&quot; Who says there are no heroes among those skilled in techniques?<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The art of healing is vast! From the time of Shennong, Huangdi, Qibo, and Leigong, it has been nothing but sages and philosophers opening its sources and wise individuals guiding its flow, thus able to alleviate the sufferings of the common people and support the creation of the heavens and earth. As the world has degraded, the scholars and gentry regard this as merely a skill and disdain it, handing it over to the common people. Therefore, the most subtle and profound principles have emerged from the most humble and base thoughts, resulting in many who cannot heal the sick and instead hasten their demise. This is why Fan Wenzheng declared that if one cannot be a good minister, then one should be a good doctor. Mr. Yichuan stated that entrusting treatment of illnesses to mediocre physicians is tantamount to being unkind and unfilial.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, renowned medical practitioners like He Huan, Bian Que, Chunyu Yi, Zhang Zhongjing, and Sun Zhenren consistently emphasized preservation of health as the priority, with medicine as a supplement. Regarding the observation of symptoms and diagnosis of pulses, they would meticulously discern even the most subtle doubts. It is lamentable that today’s physicians simplify the complexities, treating illness as if it were an enemy to be vanquished, much like strategizing for battle. They merely glimpse the teachings of Hua Tuo, who discusses methods such as dissecting and reconnecting tendons, which are just specialized techniques and not the fundamental principles of the &quot;Shennong Bencao&quot; or classical formulas of established medicinal properties. Today, only Zhang Zhongjing&#39;s works serve as the model for numerous formulas, and scholars should adhere to his teachings.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a></p></div>

Han Tianjue stated: there is no need for numerous ingredients in a prescription; just look at how simple and convenient Zhang Zhongjing’s formulas are.

<p>Wang Wenzhong stated: Many disciples of Li Ming are located in Zhongzhou, but only Liu Shouzheng&#39;s teachings are passed on by the Buddhist masters of Jing Mountains. When the master arrived in Jiangnan, he imparted his knowledge to Luo Zhitai of Song, and all the physicians of the South revered it. In the present dynasty, discussions about medicine do not neglect Liu&#39;s teachings. Although Liu and Li&#39;s methods differ in their approach to treatment, both can be reconciled and applied according to the situation and evidence; is there not validity in this? Recently, in Wuzhong, a good physician is identified as one who adheres to Dongyuan, while those who follow Zhang and Liu are labeled as esteemed practitioners. Alas! Yao and Shun acted with humility, while Tang and Wu resorted to warfare; as long as they aligned with the way to benefit the world, what need is there for sameness? I often lament those in the world focused solely on attack and defense, for the evil qi has not retreated while the true qi wanes. Those fixated on nourishment may also cause blockages in the qi path, resulting in considerable harm, where the true qi remains unrestored while the evil qi grows fiercer. The ancients said: Medicine is valuable when it is appropriate, and methods must be adaptable. If one adheres too strictly to the usual, ginseng may inadvertently kill; while understanding change, even Aconite can save lives. The words of Master Sun that one should adjust according to the time and circumstances are indeed wise!

<p>Monks and Quacks Recklessly Treating Illnesses Leading to Rapid Death</p>
<p>Chen Ruzhong once suffered from a disorder of spleen and stomach due to excessive fire, seeking treatment from Sheng Yongmei. After diagnosing his pulse, he said: &quot;If treated this way, you can live; if treated that way, you will die. This method may lead to a slight prolongation of life, but that method will cause swift death.&quot; However, after starting treatment, Ruzhong&#39;s recovery was slow. Some recommended a monk known for his medical skills, and Ruzhong was swayed by their words, thus seeking treatment from him. He took the monk&#39;s medicine and vomited a liter of blood before dying. Alas! When a physician uses medicine to combat illness, if the illness does not go away but instead leads to death, what is the purpose of medicine? That monk is merely a quack, lacking understanding of medical texts and unable to distinguish the properties of herbs, unable to observe the state of the pulse, ignoring the condition and duration of one&#39;s ailments, and only focusing on toxic substances to attack illness—his methods have likely resulted in many deaths.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Medical Integration<br>By Fu Zi (Ming Dynasty)</p>
<p>The Way of Medicine requires both precision and breadth for a clear understanding of its principles. Therefore, the sages of the past established that one must first read Confucian texts to understand the principles of change. Works such as the &quot;Suwen,&quot; &quot;Nanjing,&quot; &quot;Bencao,&quot; and &quot;Mai Jing&quot; should not be overlooked. Why is this so? It is because without the Four Books, one cannot grasp the intricacies of meaning; without the &quot;I Ching,&quot; one cannot comprehend the dynamics of yin and yang; without the &quot;Suwen,&quot; one cannot recognize illnesses; without the &quot;Bencao,&quot; one cannot identify medicines; and without the &quot;Mai Jing,&quot; one cannot diagnose the evidences of cold, heat, deficiency, and excess based on pulse examination. Thus, these texts are indispensable.</p>
<p>Moreover, human life is of utmost importance, and the variations of illness are infinite. There are old and young, differences in constitution, treatments for the five directions, distinctions for the four seasons, and nuances of yin and yang, with the need to discern cold from heat. The internal organs, meridians, qi, and blood should all be categorized properly. The interplay of the six climatic energies and the erratic expressions of the seven emotions, as well as the constant changes in qi, require different approaches and varying urgencies in treatment. Additionally, one must observe characteristics in color and pulse, inquire about daily habits, and understand that although symptoms may be similar, treatments can differ significantly. The sages offer only a glimpse into these matters. Therefore, later scholars must familiarize themselves with the strengths of various texts, integrate what they observe, and apply treatment accordingly, allowing them to be capable practitioners.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>In today&#39;s world, there are those who practice medicine purely for the sake of diagnosis and treatment, but there are few who seek a mentor to learn from. Our ancestors established the Imperial Medical Academy in the inner court and set up schools in the provinces and counties to gather individuals under the name of medicine. This was intended to cultivate talent, test their mastery, and subsequently appoint them to positions of public health responsibility, thereby promoting them to become national physicians, which greatly benefits the people of the world.</p>
<p>Historically, during the Chengzhou era, those regarded as physicians were highly selective and appointed as important officials. The current dynasty also established the foundations of medicine by carefully selecting and assigning upper-level officials to gather and educate all those who practiced medicine. They would study the texts of Xuanqi and refine the techniques of Zhang and Li, ensuring mastery before assigning them to positions. By honing their skills and specializing in their craft, they would effectively manage affairs and determine salaries, thereby eliminating the risk of premature death or illness among the populace, allowing everyone to thrive in health and longevity.</p>
<p>Therefore, medicine is considered one of the essential aspects of governance.<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a></p></div>

<p>There are eight essential points in treating illnesses; if these eight points are not carefully assessed, the illness cannot be cured. If it cannot be cured, there will be no methods available to the physician. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly distinguish these eight points to avoid mistakes. </p>
<p>First is Deficiency, which refers to the five forms of deficiency: a thin pulse, cold skin, low energy, diarrhea, and lack of appetite—these constitute the five deficiencies. </p>
<p>Second is Excess, which refers to the five forms of excess: a strong pulse, hot skin, abdominal distension, blockage in the front and back, and a feeling of fullness—these are the five excesses. </p>
<p>Third is Cold, which indicates the accumulation of cold in the internal organs. </p>
<p>Fourth is Heat, indicating the accumulation of heat in the internal organs. </p>
<p>Fifth is Pathogen, which refers to diseases not associated with the internal organs. </p>
<p>Sixth is Correctness, which implies that it is not an external pathogen that has entered the body. </p>
<p>Seventh is Internal, meaning the illness is not external. </p>
<p>Eighth is External, meaning the illness is not internal. </p>

<p>Using medicine is like administering punishment; a mistake can lead to life or death. Just as a punishment requires thorough investigation and deliberation before a verdict is given, and a crime is recorded, so must we be meticulous with life, for death cannot be reversed. The same principle applies to medicine. When a physician visits a patient, if they possess the skill to diagnose correctly and understand the relationship between pulse and medicine, then their prescriptions can yield immediate results. However, if a lesser practitioner acts recklessly, applying remedies haphazardly, it can quickly lead to peril. How easy it is to cause harm!

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Medical Principles of Ancient and Modern Times</strong><br><strong>Ming Dynasty - Xu Chunfu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Caution in Illness and Medical Care</strong></p>
<p>The sage treats diseases before they arise, not after they have manifested. This does not mean that one neglects to treat existing illnesses, nor that one is incapable of doing so. It implies that prevention is most effective at the very beginning; by carefully addressing the early signs and guarding against the petty manifestations, one achieves greater success with fewer harms. Only by addressing the subtle beginning does one prevent it from developing into a more serious condition, thereby avoiding any sickness that must be treated later. </p>
<p>People today tend to treat existing illnesses rather than prevent emerging ones, often disregarding early warning signs and waiting for the disease to fully develop before seeking medical help. This neglect of early symptoms leads to more severe conditions, which is clearly evident. The sage’s approach to daily life and actions is meticulous, ensuring proper care at all times. If even minor, obscure ailments arise, they are carefully attended to with preventive measures and treatments. Thus, the sage&#39;s practice of treating ailments before they manifest rather than after is exemplified. </p>
<p>The Analects say: “What the Master is cautious about, are the concerns of battle and illness.” Cheng Yi explains: “Battle concerns the oversight of the divine; sincerity leads to spiritual elevation; illness pertains to matters of life and death; and battle relates to the survival of the nation.”<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The three cautions are indeed the most significant; however, is it not to be taken with utmost seriousness? When Master Kang was offered medicine, he said he would not dare to taste it until he was fully aware of its effects. This illustrates how the sages carefully consider illness and medicine with great seriousness. </p>
<p>People in the world not only lack knowledge of preventing illness before it arises, but also, when they do fall ill, they are unaware of the need for caution. At the onset of slight ailments, they indulge without restraint, leading to severe problems. Only in desperation do they seek medical help, often recklessly choosing based on rumors or recommendations, entrusting their care to the foolish. As a result, they suffer significant damage due to their previous negligence and lack of reflection on medical treatment. </p>
<p>In urgent situations, one does not have the luxury to carefully select a physician. Little do they realize that medicine is essential for everyone; even the sages are not exempt from illness. However, they have always sought knowledge and have acquainted themselves with well-regarded physicians. When a minor ailment arises, they seek treatment readily, finding cures with ease. </p>
<p>It is akin to remedying a fire hazard before it ignites; how could one suffer from burning if one acts prudently? Danxi has undoubtedly elaborated on this matter. The superficial understanding often leaves much yet to be comprehended. Indeed, the astonishment of the scholar is something that cannot be avoided. </p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The Ancient Medicine&#39;s Fourteen Categories</p>
<p>Among the Fourteen Categories of Ancient Medicine, there was originally a category for the spleen and stomach, which has now been lost. The &quot;Daozang Jing&quot; contains much discussion on this matter. Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, only thirteen categories have been used for evaluating medical practices. These are: the category for wind, followed by the category for external illnesses, then the major pulse category, the minor pulse category, the category for women&#39;s obstetrics, the acupuncture category, the ophthalmology category, the category for throat, mouth, and teeth, the category for sores and ulcers, the orthopedics category, the category for gold and arrows, the category for health preservation, and the category for incantations. In our current dynasty, only thirteen categories have been retained, and the category for the spleen and stomach has never been revived. Li Gao from the Yuan dynasty wrote &quot;On the Spleen and Stomach,&quot; which is notably detailed. However, it does not mention the absence of the fourteen categories—was this due to his own interpretation of ancient texts, or was it purely a new invention that aligned with ancient knowledge? This indeed is a great fortune for the medical path. Upon observing contemporary physicians, many do not specialize in the spleen and stomach; they merely employ methods of opposite treatment, attacking diseases to address superficial symptoms, knowing only to treat heat with cold, cold with heat, obstruction with passage, and passage with obstruction. Using cold because of cold, or heat because of heat, or passage because of passage, or obstruction because of obstruction, must invariably lead to exacerbating the original condition, neglecting its underlying causes, which is the so-called method of following treatment; they seem utterly unaware of this. Moreover, when it leads to damage of the spleen and stomach, they still do not pay attention, and when the vital energy is compromised, many symptoms can arise.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If the spleen is deficient and the qi is short, leading to an inability to sustain oneself, resulting in what resembles wheezing and panting, physicians still prescribe medicines to descend qi and alleviate wheezing. If the spleen is weak and the defensive qi does not circulate, leading to swelling, physicians still prescribe medicines to deplete qi and promote water metabolism. If the spleen is weak and there is stagnation, resulting in alternating fever and chills, physicians attribute it to external pathogens and use dispersing medicines. In large segments like these, the deficiency merely aggravates the deficiency, leading to the depletion of qi and death; subsequently administering ginseng decoction or aconite decoction after collapse—how can it possibly nurture life?</p>
<p>From what is observed now, those who are insufficient are often the majority, especially since the forces of competition in the pursuit of fame and profit lead to excessive worry, damaging the spleen and causing illness for many. If the body is robust yet is occasionally invaded by wind, cold, summer heat, or dampness, such cases are rarely seen to recover simply through attack. This explains why traditional Chinese medicine can easily lead to success in treatment. However, when encountering the spleen and stomach deficiency causing attacks from wind, cold, summer heat, or dampness, and treating those who have strong bodies, significant variances can arise. If one continues to aggressively treat without cease, they may say that the medicine does not diminish the dizziness, and the disease does not heal. They must take vigorous measures, yet this further injures the spleen and stomach, making the condition worse. When their techniques are exhausted and they feel there is no solution, they say it is difficult to treat. What a great flaw this is; how could one chronicle it all? Ultimately, it is due to a lack of understanding of the root cause.</p>
<p>The classics say: &quot;Those who have grain will thrive; those who lose grain will perish.&quot; It is also said: &quot;Those who have stomach qi live; those who lack stomach qi die.&quot; Therefore, the stomach qi and grain qi, is it not the foundation of the human body?<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a></p></div>

The two are distinct and shouldn&#39;t be equated. The way of medicine originated with Shennong and was elaborated by the Yellow Emperor, who specified certain medicines for certain ailments, reflected in texts like the &quot;Neijing&quot; and &quot;Suwen,&quot; considered the sacred canons for aiding people’s lives; how can this be compared to the practices of witch doctors? However, practitioners of medicine vary in skill; thus, their names differ. Those who are proficient in medicine are called wise doctors, those skilled are good doctors, those preserving the health of the country are national doctors, while those who lack understanding are termed incompetent doctors. Those who beat drums and perform dances to ward off illness are called witch doctors. Therefore, witch doctors, who do not understand the principles of medicine, are referred to as such by those in the South. In modern times, they may be called &quot;Duan Gong Tai Bao,&quot; or &quot;night-walking diviners,&quot; and in the North referred to as &quot;Shi Po.&quot; Though they are all considered to be of dubious character, one still cannot lack constancy, how much less so in other matters?<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a></p></div>

Hearing of your honorable name, I have come to seek guidance.&quot; I replied: &quot;The art of medicine is certainly secondary to the Confucian teachings. However, since it concerns life and death, it is not to be taken lightly. If a learner does not possess a genuine passion and dedication, it is difficult to grasp its subtleties. You have mentioned your difficulties, indicating that your ambitions have not yet been realized; returning to study medicine raises concerns that your stagnation might hinder your ability to delve deeply into it.&quot; He, often with an annoyed expression, said: &quot;Although you are facing hardships, you still follow Confucianism and read the works of Confucius and Mencius, having a basic understanding of the principles of governance throughout history. Now, simply aspiring to learn a technical skill—how can that be a lofty pursuit?&quot; I responded: &quot;I fear that mere superficial engagement will not suffice. You have not yet comprehended the teachings of the ancient Three Sovereigns on medicine, so let us set that aside. Even so, figures such as Zhang Zhongjing of the Han, Ge Hong of the Jin, Chu Cheng of the Qi, and Tao Yinjun of the Liang all practiced Confucianism while possessing talent and virtue. I have heard that the scholar knows rites and righteousness, while the physician understands gain and loss. Without proper cultivation of rituals and righteousness, one becomes ignorant of the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. Failing to distinguish between gain and loss endangers the lives of the people. Can the realms of Confucianism and medicine be treated lightly?

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Five Difficulties</p>
<p>Song Lian said: Alas! How difficult it is to speak of medicine! The life of a person flows in circulation with the energies of heaven and earth. If one manages to nourish oneself correctly, then harmony prevails and a hundred ailments disappear. If one loses this nourishment, internal injuries arise from the seven emotions, and external afflictions from the six energies, leading to illness. The physician must investigate the root and branches; in essence, he must diminish what is substantive and augment what is deficient. The balance of yin and yang must be preserved, allowing one to adapt to the center. If a crude practitioner is ignorant of this, mixing the substantiated and the vacuous, he will exhaust what is lacking while enhancing what is excessive. Consequently, the ability of illness to arise becomes rare; this constitutes one difficulty. The movement of qi and blood requires specific conduits. The arms and legs, each embodying yin and yang, must balance; if the three yang are insufficient, what of the yangming? It pertains to the principle of two yangs converging in brightness. If yin is excessively diminished, what of the jueyin? It refers to the union of two yins to their fullest extent. When facing illness, it is imperative to know which remedies to apply. While treating may not be difficult, one must also understand the medicinal properties that guide the principles; by following this method, no sickness will be without remedy.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Rough practitioners do not distinguish the Twelve Meridians and apply treatments indiscriminately, much like a sparrow caught in the river or fishing in the woods; even if they occasionally succeed, it is sheer luck! This is the second difficulty. The seasonal energies are different each year, and treatments should be accordingly adjusted. When it is time for rising and falling, we should follow and accept their flow; when faced with cold and heat, we should resist and counter them. In doing so, we can preserve the natural harmony and avoid disorder and error. Rough practitioners, however, blindly go against the grain, reversing what should be followed and following what should be resisted, like a blind person lost in the wilderness, unable to discern east from west. This constitutes the third difficulty. Diseases can manifest as hot or cold; heat requires cooling treatments, while cold should be treated with warmth—this is a fundamental principle. Yet, when the forces of cold and heat are intense, attempting to reverse them suddenly will surely clash and create obstacles. Heat must be treated with heat, and cold with cold; their beginnings may be the same, but their ends are different, which may lead to successful outcomes. Rough practitioners, however, fail to observe this and mix treatments indiscriminately. This is the fourth difficulty. Medicinal properties have yin and yang, yet they are not solely categorized as such; there exists yin within yang and yang within yin. A slight deviation can result in a significant error. Rough practitioners neglect to weigh the relative strengths and recklessly apply treatments. This is the fifth difficulty.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Medicine</strong></p>
<p>Yuli Zi said: Governing the world is akin to practicing medicine, is it not? A physician diagnoses by feeling the pulse to understand the symptoms and examines the symptoms to formulate a treatment plan. Symptoms possess yin and yang, vacuity and solidity, while the pulse can be superficial or deep, fine or strong, and the treatment will involve the right balance of tonification and purgation, acupuncture, cautery, and decoctions. The herbs such as ginseng, poria, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and huang, are applied according to the patient&#39;s illness; if appropriately administered, they lead to life, but if not, they result in death. Therefore, to know the symptoms and pulse yet not be adept at formulating treatments, one is not a physician. Even possessing knowledge like Bian Que&#39;s, if one merely boasts without usefulness, without understanding symptoms and pulse, relying on hearsay for treatments, declaring, &quot;I can heal,&quot; is to be a thief of the world. Thus, disorder is equivalent to symptoms; order and structure are like the pulse; morality and laws correspond to treatments and regulations; talent is like medicine. In the governance of the Xia, loyalty was emphasized, while the Yin took advantage of its deficiencies to restore it with substance; the governance of the Yin valued substance, while the Zhou exploited its flaws to restore it with culture. The Qin applied harsh punishments and severe laws to suppress the world, resulting in widespread suffering. Yet, the Han embraced leniency and maintained tranquility, perfectly matching their treatments with symptoms; their medicinal applications seldom failed, ensuring that few ailments remained untreated. Furthermore, one must understand that if the cold at a single finger is not warmed, it will affect the hands and feet, and if the cold at the hands and feet is not warmed, the entire body will suffer, as the energies and pulses are interconnected. A small issue can lead to a significant one; thus, illnesses in people begin at a minor level. Failure to comprehend the fundamental causes, or even understanding yet being confused, ultimately leads to a major issue that cannot be saved, resulting in death. Is this not tragic? Oh! Someone like Yuli Zi can be said to have a profound understanding of the essence of medicine!<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><h3>The Unity of Principles</h3>
<p>   Diseases such as cold damage, internal injury, women’s issues, and children’s ailments are all within the practice of medicine, but they have each become categorized into different schools over the generations. In today’s world, some are labeled as specialists in certain fields, others as having multiple specialties, while some are deemed not to belong to certain fields. They are unaware that in ancient times, there was a physician named Bian Que who traveled past Handan and became known as a female physician when he encountered noble women; he passed by Suiyang and became known as a doctor for the elderly when he heard of the Zhou people&#39;s affection for older adults; he entered Xiangyang and became a pediatrician upon learning of the Qin people’s love for children. He adapted to societal norms without distinguishing differences in the treatment of illnesses. When it comes to medicine, all is interconnected by the same principles. To say that one is strong in one area and weak in another also indicates a lack of thorough understanding of these principles.</p>
<h3>The Goodness of Acupuncture, Moxibustion, and Medicine</h3>
<p>   Bian Que remarked that diseases are limited to the area affected by the skin and muscle, or those that penetrate the blood vessels and tissues, or involve the stomach and intestines. Therefore, one must integrate acupuncture, moxibustion, and medicine in order to genuinely engage in the healing arts. Engaging in true medical practice requires a comprehensive understanding akin to that of a well-rounded official in the Zhou dynasty. In the past, the fallacy was to restrict the art of saving lives solely to medication, thus neglecting acupuncture and moxibustion. Whenever faced with diseases like cold damage that penetrate into the blood chamber, or injuries from impact, which cannot be cured by medicinal pills, one might find themselves at a loss without the intervention of acupuncture, feeling inadequate in skill. It was realized that treating illness is much like a strategic confrontation, where offense and defense must align with the characteristics of the enemy, revealing the true benefits of acupuncture, moxibustion, and medicine in relation to the illness at hand.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a></p></div>

They ridicule their peers who study and seek knowledge, tiring themselves in vain. Whenever they attempt treatments, they act irrationally, haphazardly dispensing medicines, occasionally finding fleeting success, but invariably demanding excessive compensation. If any harm results, they claim to have done their best. It is common for many to adopt this approach and claim that medicine is simple; is that really the case? Alas!

<p>What people in the world value most is life; the means to sustain life is medicine, and the foundation of medicine lies in its principles. In ancient times, figures like the Yellow Emperor, Qi Bo, Bian Que, and Hua Tuo mastered the art of reviving the dead and restoring consciousness, carrying these skills down through the three dynasties. However, those who study these arts today are often superficial and lack thorough understanding. Consequently, there are those who mislead others. Why is this so? It is because they interpret the yin with yang, and the yang with yin; they push the void with the solid, and measure the solid with the void; they consider the external in relation to the internal, and the internal in relation to the external; they assess urgency with slowness, and slowness with urgency; they advance with a retreating eye, and probe forward with a retreating stance. </p>
<p>They are reckless in diagnosing pulses, shallow in observing symptoms, confused in judging sounds, and hazy in assessing colors. This leads to a reversal of techniques that blind and confuse, misapplying remedies to the deaf and blind. They cut short lives yet to blossom, and extinguish souls that should thrive.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Method of Using Medicines</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to the method of using medicines, one must not rigidly adhere to ancient formulas. Instead, adjustments should be made based on the severity of symptoms, modifying the ingredients according to the varying properties of heat and cold to ensure they align with the principles of treatment. One must not apply recklessly; misguidedly administering pills or powders can, in an instant, harm or endanger life. Is there not a natural order that physicians must heed carefully? Substances like realgar, chaulmoogra, quartz, borax, and cinnabar must not be fire-cooked. Herbs such as Sichuan pepper, aconite, turmeric, southern star, and pinellia should not be used raw; they must be processed diligently according to proper methods for medicines to be effective.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Luo Qianfu stated: A child, during the fifth month, suffered abdominal pain after consuming cold powder. He subsequently purchased Shenqi Pills from a pharmacy, which led to an increase in cold pain around the navel and abdomen, intermittently for seven to eight years without relief. Reflecting on the ancients&#39; saying, &quot;Cold should be treated with heat,&quot; one must adhere to established principles; a competent physician cannot abandon their essential guidelines to change methods. The harmful substance was cold, and the medicine used was also cold; heavy cold injures the stomach, which explains the cold pain. The human spleen and stomach prefer warmth and reject cold, particularly for children whose vital energy and blood are still weak and cannot tolerate cold. Thus, the yang energy becomes dormant, and cold toxins linger, remaining unresolved over time. To treat illness, one must first address the root cause, using medicines that harmonize and nourish the vital energy to rectify earlier mistakes; only after one month of such treatment can recovery be expected.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a></p></div>

When Kang Zi offered medicine, Confucius bowed and accepted it, and due to his lack of understanding, he did not dare to taste it; this is the essence of preserving life. How is it that ordinary people merely sit silently and pulse-check, claiming to know the illness? The pulse is the blood and energy of a person flowing between the meridians; if heat prevails, the pulse is rapid; if cold prevails, the pulse is slow; when it is robust, it indicates strength; when it is weak, it indicates deficiency. As for what is injured, how can one distinguish its form? Physicians must thoroughly examine the source of illness, and the patient must also disclose the source of their ailment. Yet this man&#39;s father did not inform the doctor of the illness&#39; source and sought medicine from the marketplace, while the dispenser of medicine also failed to assess the condition, resulting in a sickness lasting seven or eight years, all missing this principle. The real master Sun said: “Inquiring before diagnosis is most accurate.” Dongpo said: “One should just seek to recover from illness and not burden the physician.” The words of these two gentlemen greatly benefit the world.</p>
<p>Entry to the Study of Medicine<br>【Ming Dynasty – Li Chen】</p>
<p>Standards for Practicing Medicine</p>
<p>The practice of medicine involves human life; it must be genuine and unpretentious, characterized by calmness and constancy, possessing true knowledge of the nuances of Yin and virtue. One cannot recklessly pursue the study of medicine. Once the resolve is established, then one may deliberate on the application of efforts. Every morning, sit quietly facing the diagram of the primordial, studying the &quot;Classic of Filial Piety,&quot; &quot;Analects,&quot; and &quot;Elementary Learning&quot;; those with substantial resources should also study all the Four Books, the ancient texts of the I Ching, the &quot;Classic of Documents,&quot; &quot;Great Plan,&quot; &quot;Unfettered,&quot; and the &quot;Classic of Yao.&quot; Grasp the general meaning without the need for forced memorization.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Indeed, the practice of medicine originates from Confucianism. Without studying and understanding principles, one remains ignorant and unable to grasp the complexities of change. Every noon, upon entering, one should read aloud from the beginning to the end, methodically, ensuring that no word is missed, as if it flows from the mouth. </p>
<p>If one desires to specialize in minor subjects, it is also essential to study major subjects; if one wishes to focus on surgery, one must not neglect internal medicine. Understanding one requires knowledge of the other; there has never been a case of mastering one while ignoring the other. It is precisely due to the varied levels of depth and familiarity that there are divisions in specialties. </p>
<p>After thorough reading, one should contemplate quietly, investigating the meanings within. If there are doubts or difficulties, one should consult ancient and modern renowned texts to broaden one’s knowledge. Alternatively, seeking advice from virtuous and wise individuals is advisable. Tao Jie&#39;an stated: &quot;Just do not engage in conversation with the ignorant.&quot; This is because formulas and remedies do not stray from the “Ben Cao,” “Su,” and “Nan,” as well as works by Zhang, Liu, Li, and Zhu. Even if there are minor treatments and quick methods, they are ultimately not the work of the masters, and one must be cautious to avoid being misled by them.</p>
<p>Once the fundamental texts have been thoroughly comprehended, one can then qualify as a minor physician. With greater dedication to quiet meditation, one should revisit Confucian texts, gaining a basic understanding of the dynamics of yin and yang, learning from both close relations and distant ones, thus preparing to offer assistance effectively in various situations. </p>
<p>Particularly in one’s conduct, it is crucial to establish consistent guidelines. Each dawn, one should purify the heart through quiet meditation and rise early to engage with Confucian texts, in order to refresh the source of one’s heart. </p>
<p>At all times, one should not lose the vitality of early morning, which is wondrous.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>When examining a patient, one must first inquire about the onset of symptoms and the date they began. From head to toe, one should reference the initial signs of typhoid fever, mixed symptoms, and methods of distinguishing internal and external injuries, questioning each detail thoroughly. If the symptoms are severe but clearly categorized, one need not check the pulse and can discuss treatment options. If the symptoms are mild yet not clearly defined, pulse examination is necessary for careful assessment.</p>
<p>For men, the left side is examined first, followed by the right; for women, the right side is examined first, followed by the left, in accordance with the principles of yin and yang. First, assess each channel individually to understand the hidden curves. Then, take a comprehensive look to determine the state of deficiency or excess, life or death. After the diagnosis, any remarks about the patient&#39;s condition must be truthful, whether they indicate excess or deficiency, and one should clarify the treatability and difficulty of the case, sharing the details of symptoms to evaluate one’s own state of mind. If there are aspects that were overlooked, they should be openly clarified without embellishment.</p>
<p>It is crucial to remain calm and consider the options carefully, avoiding hasty or intense actions that may lead to fear. When examining women, it is essential to first consult their close relatives about the symptoms, appearance, and dietary habits; then, proceed according to convenience. For severe cases, one may conduct the examination from a bedside screen, while in less severe cases, examine at the door behind a curtain, always ensuring to cover one&#39;s hands with a thin gauze. </p>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Widows and unmarried women should be even more respectful and careful, as this is not a trivial matter. When discussing illness, one must clearly analyze and discern whether it is an internal injury or an external affliction; whether it pertains to miscellaneous diseases, or whether it shows signs of Yin deficiency; whether it is primarily an internal injury with some external influence, or primarily an external affliction with some internal injury. Discussing prescriptions should be based on the pulse, following what has been established and avoiding any secrecy. </p>
<p>According to ancient methods, one should adjust based on the patient&#39;s age, the circumstances of their situation, and whether they have taken any medications before. Women experience menstrual cycles and childbirth, while men deal with the labor and leisure of sexual activity. </p>
<p>Although based on ancient wisdom, one should not be bound by it. Understanding the organs and functions leads to certainty and prevents misjudgment. Care must be taken when administering medicine. For any specific condition, designate one herb as the sovereign, another as the minister, and others as assistants. </p>
<p>All treatment should stem from qualified practitioners; certainly, the application and formulation of medicines must align with established practices, especially in urgent situations — how can those suffering from ailments manage this themselves? If someone insists on self-administering remedies, their intentions should be respected, but they must adhere to the classical methods of preparation without risking the efficacy of the medicine through clever tricks. Should the pathological conditions remain somewhat unclear, and if the medicine does not yield strong results, it is advisable to wait quietly and reflect deeply on the underlying causes, then reassess and adjust the prescription; recovery is assured. </p>
<p>Once the illness is treated, that remains the task of the physician. Even while adhering to simplicity, when using this to sustain one’s livelihood, one should not overly demand compensation but should accept what is offered. If a patient is extremely poor and does not provide anything, it particularly demonstrates the physician’s compassion and integrity.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>If a person cannot repay, then heaven will repay them. Thus, with a steadfast heart, is there a technique that is unclear or ineffective? Someone asked about the essence of a single word, and the answer was: merely to not deceive. One who reads medical books but does not go through them from beginning to end, only partially understanding one method or another, is deceiving themselves; one who reads thoroughly but does not comprehend or integrate the knowledge is also deceiving themselves; one who understands but does not rise early to calmly sit and regulate their breath, thinking this suffices for diagnosis, is deceiving themselves; one who diagnoses a pulse but does not accurately convey the truth is deceiving themselves; one who discusses prescriptions and medications carelessly and without detail is deceiving themselves; one who hopes for gain after recovery, yet remains entangled in worldly ways, is deceiving themselves. </p>
<p>It is not the lack of profit that is concerning with a physician, but rather the lack of clarity. Repeatedly using methods that yield results while gaining understanding, yet not compiling this knowledge to repay heaven and earth for the public good, is also deceitful. Deceit clouds one&#39;s conscience and causes the medical way to ultimately fail; honesty, on the other hand, allows for the cultivation of one’s moral sense and the flourishing of medicinal practices. The distinction between honesty and deceit is beyond human manipulation.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a></p></div>

<ol>
<li>Maintain a compassionate heart, which is the best advice; generously help the masses, and your kindness will be profound.  </li>

<li>Differentiate between emotional and physical conditions; when your understanding is clear, even chronic illnesses can be addressed.  </li>
<li>Recognize the origins of diseases; only when a doctor can confidently discuss these matters can they truly be considered specialized.  </li>
<li>Understand the flow of Qi to comprehend seasonal changes; adapt treatments of warming or cooling according to the time.  </li>
<li>Be familiar with the meridians, and correctly identify diseases; like the famous physician Bian Que, have a complete understanding of internal organs.  </li>
<li>Know the properties of medicines and tailor prescriptions to diseases; failing to distinguish between warming and cooling might harm patients with specific conditions.  </li>
<li>Master the preparation of medicines, paying attention to the correct heat; too much or too little can determine safety and risk.  </li>
<li>Do not be jealous or let personal preferences influence you; the principles of nature are evident, so quickly repent of such thoughts.  </li>

Many modern physicians do not understand this meaning; they often focus on the wealthy while neglecting the poor. This is a habitual sentiment among doctors and is hardly a compassionate practice.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Five Precepts and Ten Essentials of Medical Practitioners</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>First Precept</strong>: Regardless of the patient&#39;s size, wealth, or status, if someone seeks your help, do not delay or dismiss them. If you wish to go but do not, it is not easy; do not consider the cost of medicine lightly. You should do your best with each case, and naturally, your reputation will grow, without harming your conscience.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Second Precept</strong>: When examining women, widows, or nuns, always wait for an attendant to be present before entering the room for diagnosis. If there is no companion, do not examine them alone. If there are inconvenient issues at hand, you should earnestly observe, but even to close relatives, do not speak of it, due to the nature of the domestic environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Third Precept</strong>: Do not accept precious gifts or items from patients as a means of barter. If it is truly necessary, have them prepare it themselves. If the treatment does not work, there will be no suspicion of blame. Moreover, do not praise the quality of their possessions; such behavior is unworthy of a gentleman.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fourth Precept</strong>: As someone who saves lives, do not engage in leisure activities like climbing mountains, carrying wine, or traveling for pleasure. Additionally, do not leave your home at inappropriate times.<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a></p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>Whenever someone arrives with an illness, one must personally examine them, carefully prepare the medicine, and write the prescription according to the texts. One must not fabricate prescriptions or be subject to questioning by others. </p>
<p>The five prohibitions: As for courtesans and private practitioners requesting to see patients, one should treat them as one would the children of respectable families, refraining from inappropriate remarks to derive improper benefits, and upon completing the consultation, they should leave. For the impoverished, the cost of medicine may be returned, but one should only dispense medicine and not allow further visits, to avoid temptations of immorality.</p>
<p>First imperative: One must first understand Confucian principles to then grasp medical theories, whether internal or external. It is essential to diligently read the ancient texts of distinguished medical theories, never letting go of them day or night, and to consult each one thoroughly, absorbing the intricate changes, imprinting them in the heart, and discerning them with the eyes so that one will not err when diagnosing patients.</p>
<p>Second imperative: When selecting and purchasing medicines, one must strictly adhere to the methods of Lei Gong (the Thunder God). Medicines should be prepared according to established prescriptions, while some may be adjusted according to the illness as needed. Decoctions and powders should be readily prepared, while pills must be made in advance. Medicines become more effective with age, and those that age well will differ in nature. One should not be stingy with valuable medicines; in the end, they will surely bring benefit.</p>
<p>Third imperative: Among fellow practitioners in the countryside, one must not harbor feelings of contempt or arrogance; it is crucial to remain humble and cautious.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a></p></div>

If a household lacks a solid foundation and indulges in luxury, expenses become excessive; mildly, there are no savings, severely, there is poverty and distress.</p>

Those who seek to advance must understand if intentions align with heaven’s will, recognizing what is in accordance with or against nature.

Otherwise, those with medicine but without firewood or food may find their lives difficult to preserve.</p>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Discussion on Children&#39;s Health</strong></p>
<p>In the practice of medicine, one must first rectify oneself, and then address the ailments of others. To rectify oneself means to understand principles and fully utilize techniques. To rectify others means to accurately apply remedies to cure diseases. Only then will success be assured. If one cannot rectify oneself, how can one rectify others? If one cannot rectify others, how can one cure diseases? This is mentioned at the beginning to encourage learners.</p>
<p>As for those who practice medicine, they should possess a warm and gentle temperament, remain humble in aspirations, observe etiquette in actions, and be harmonious and gentle in demeanor, without self-aggrandizement or pretentiousness. They should broadly gather medicinal knowledge, deeply understand principles, be clear about the movements of Qi, grasp yin and yang, skillfully diagnose through pulse and sight, distinguish between truth and falsehood, differentiate cold and heat, examine root and branch, and identify severity and lightness. Minor illnesses should not be treated as major, and easy matters should not be neglected for difficult ones. The attention to detail should be the same for the poor and rich alike; there should be no distinction in the usage of medicines between nobility and commoners. If one can do so, they are close to the true path. Conversely, failing to do so makes one a great bane to living beings.</p>
<p>When a physician is summoned, they should not discriminate by status or distance, and must attend indiscriminately. Upon arriving at the home, they should first inquire whether medical help has been previously sought, and what medicines were administered. If there has been treatment already, then one can discern the truth of the situation. Furthermore, when treating children, one must be aware of the distinct characteristics based on geographical differences and must carefully consider the varying temperatures of the locality; treatments should not be uniform, as the ancients were particularly cautious in this regard.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>Essential Readings in Medicine</strong><br><strong>(Ming - Li Zhongzi)</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>On Not Losing Human Feelings</strong>  </p>
<p>I once read the &quot;Inner Classic&quot; and came across the discussion on the variations of treatments, which concludes with the phrase: &quot;Not losing human feelings.&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but be struck by it, sighing deeply at how profound this understanding is for practitioners. The notion of not losing human feelings is something that physicians must urgently consider, yet it proves to be quite difficult. Generally, human feelings can be categorized into three types: the feelings of the patient, the feelings of others, and the feelings of the physician.  </p>
<p>The so-called feelings of the patient are characterized by the distinct conditions of the five organs and the varying responses of the seven emotions. Yang organs require coolness, whereas Yin organs require warmth. Those who can tolerate toxins may find mild treatments ineffective, while those who cannot tolerate them may suffer harm from strong treatments; this reflects the differences in the energies of the organs. Each person&#39;s preferences and aversions vary with activity and rest, as well as with food and drink. Those who are inclined to good fortune often dismiss warnings, while those who are more anxious may find comfort in false reassurances. For the untrusting, sincere advice is hard to accept, and those who are skeptical may reject deeper insights out of caution.  </p>
<p>Moreover, the wealthy often indulge their desires and disregard restrictions, while the noble may act with pride and defy reason; these depict the differences in social interactions. The poor struggle to meet basic needs, making it difficult to consider medicine and remedies. The lowly labor excessively with little remedy, and their burdens are evident; these illustrate the variations in treatment approaches.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a></p></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are sound words that, once believed, can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations—many paths lead to losing one’s way, ultimately resulting in empty promises; this is the harm of lack of guidance. Some are overly cautious, seeking only safety, but with limited resources, they inevitably face failure; this is the harm of excessive caution. There are circumstances that do not align, leading to unfulfilled desires, deep emotional ties, and even the best remedies may be ineffective; this is the harm of gains and losses. Some act too hastily and face delayed ailments, complicating their treatment; others are too slow and encounter urgent problems, leading to a situation that is hard to rectify; this is the harm of haste and delay. Some fear the remedies due to their bitter taste, leading to mental blockages; others fear aggressive treatments, causing their spirit to become unsettled; this is the harm of the mind. Some avoid discussing their ailments, harbor hidden troubles, and even conceal symptoms, merely relying on pulse diagnosis without understanding that since ancient times, wise figures have never depended solely on pulse without considering other symptoms; for instance, if the pulse shows fullness, one knows it could be due to food damage, but the exact time and nature of the injury cannot be discerned solely through the pulse. These are emotional aspects of patients, which must not be overlooked. </p>
<p>As for the feelings of others: some may adhere to opinions grounded in evidence, while the illness may not correspond; others may speak without basis, and the medical principles have never actually appeared in dreams.<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a></p></div>

Some hold on to prestigious opinions that are hard to counter, while others have biases that are hard to correct. It is like recommending a doctor on matters of life and death, where some recommend out of personal affection, others for superficial effects, some trust their reputation, and others for greedy rewards.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There exists a jealousy that leads to exclusion, where the sun may share a common heart while the shadows permeate; right and wrong are reversed, and distinctions are blurred. This is the flow of slander and jealousy. There are those who are greedy and ignorant, dismissing human life lightly; when illness is precarious, even a good doctor cannot be certain. Despite thorough care, there is still hope for recovery, yet the greedy, in their eagerness for achievement, irresponsibly administer treatments that lead to ruin, thus spreading slander to disguise their failures. This is the flow of greed and fortune. </p>
<p>There are opinions held individually, leading to indecision over similarities and differences. Those who aspire to high ideals often have few allies, while those who strive for lofty paths frequently face slander. How much can be collectively shared, and how easily can disturbances arise from many voices? This is the flow of superficiality. </p>
<p>Some, who are longtime acquaintances, work opportunistically for gain; others, who are strangers, engage in ad hoc debates. If the patient does not recognize the physician, they hastily seek financial help, while physicians, unwilling to bear grudges, can only rely on superficial remedies. Some engage many doctors, watching each other; others, with vested interests, avoid suspicion. They only seek to avoid blame; indeed, they may succeed. But who is to blame for missing opportunities? This results from a lack of true understanding of the physician and reliance on unqualified doctors.</p>
<p>In all these cases, is there not a depth to human emotions? Yet, the complexities of human sentiment are too numerous to exhaust fully. The sage warns against losing sight of human feelings, urging learners to reflect and be cautious, lest they fall into bad habits. Nevertheless, to avoid loss is not without its compromises. Compromises may exacerbate the illness, while not compromising can strain human relations. There are inevitable conditions where one must compromise on illness, and yet there are also unavoidable social dynamics that require concessions. How, then, can one navigate this? Hence it is said: “How difficult it is!”<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The principles of observation, listening, questioning, and examining should be thorough. One must distinguish between tonifying and purging, and recognize the variations of cold and heat. Life is incredibly precious, and the consequences of error are inescapable; if one makes a mistake, there can be no atonement, no matter how long one may seek it. How can one afford to be careless? Such is called a little heart. To tonify is to tonify, and to purge is to purge; heat is heat, and cold is cold. Use appropriate methods according to the situation, apply recovery techniques, and administrate ginger in moderation. Constantly strive to restore life; analyze principles thoroughly and avoid indecision. Those who can act thus are called bold. The four aspects may seem separate but are fundamentally connected.</p>
<p>In the world, there has not been a meticulous scholar who uses established methods to harm others, nor a resourceful person who damages their reputation and integrity for personal loss. Those who are skilled in treatments will have complete wisdom. A little heart fears mistakes, while a bold heart understands the diagnosis of medicines. Sometimes, a powerful remedy or a minor supplement may seem brash, but ignorance of the balance can lead to unresolved ailments; thus, boldness allows one to exercise caution effectively.</p>
<p>Hence, a small heart paired with a bold spirit leads to complete wisdom, while a small heart and bold spirit together cultivate effective medical practices. In this way, suspicion of methods may disrupt wisdom, and caution may hinder boldness; therefore, these concepts must be articulated and expressed.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Treatise on Herbal Medicine: Commentary by Miao Xiyong in the Ming Dynasty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five Principles for Healers</strong></p>
<p>All human ailments arise from a disregard for the lives of countless beings, exhausting human and material resources, and a tendency to kill birds, beasts, and insects. They may even unjustly impose punishment on the innocent. These various actions generate karma that leads to suffering in return. Those who practice medicine and serve as healers must feel compassion when witnessing suffering. They should carefully examine medical texts, diligently seek the path of healing, and thoroughly contemplate their practices, aiming for harmony with the natural order. </p>
<p>One must constantly reflect: if the remedy does not match the illness, and the illness does not connect with the right treatment, it could lead to irreversible consequences. Human life is of utmost importance, and retribution is inescapable. Do not sacrifice your conscience for momentary gain, as it may result in untold suffering in future lives—beware of this! Fear the repercussions rather than rejoice in temporary comforts. </p>
<p>For anyone aspiring to be a healer, they must first engage in scholarly study; and for those wishing to study, they must first learn to read. Literacy is the beginning of learning. Without understanding the meaning of characters, how can one grasp the texts?

It is like facing a wall or being akin to a wooden puppet—desiring to alleviate the suffering of the people, yet finding it not difficult? Hence, in ancient times, they were called great physicians; today, we refer to them as Confucian physicians. Great physicians study deeply to understand principles, focusing on both body and mind, observing the world with cautious vigilance, seeking the middle path, and in moments of urgency, dare not act recklessly. Anything less would merely be considered common craft and not worthy of being called medicine.</p>
<p>For anyone who wishes to be a physician, it is essential to first understand medicine. The origin of medicine varies by region, affecting its quality; if it is harvested at the wrong time, its efficacy is entirely disrupted. Furthermore, markets may present counterfeit products that can easily confuse the genuine. Unless one recognizes the true qualities and diligently tests the properties and flavors, it is rare to avoid being misled. Just as a general who does not understand military strategy cannot achieve victories, a physician who is ignorant of medicine is in a similar plight. Having understood the medicines, one should then practice diligently in this field.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a></p></div>

Even if one is close to others, they will ultimately gain no benefit. Growing old without gaining knowledge is indeed a sorrowful fate.

<p><strong>Treating Illness</strong></p>
<p>Chang notes that during the Spring and Autumn period, Zuo&#39;s commentary was well-versed in medical principles, while Han scholars had ceased to study medicine. The Grand Historian has little to mention regarding those like Cang Gong, let alone others! Later, works such as &quot;Hua Yuanhua&#39;s Biography&quot; delve into the chaotic and superstitious, where it was indeed scholars who first determined the pulse diagnosis. There are many prescriptions from the Tang dynasty, which are not surprising. Those who discuss medicine in the &quot;Jiu Ling Shan Fang Ji&quot; should broadly read a variety of texts, seek the intentions of sages, and understand the return of natural laws. Is their ambition not vast?</p>
<p>The path of medicine requires precision to illuminate its principles and breadth to grasp its essentials. Therefore, previous scholars established teachings that required students to first read Confucian texts, understanding the principles of the &quot;Yi,&quot; the &quot;Suwen,&quot; and not to neglect the &quot;Bencao&quot; and &quot;Mai Jing.&quot; Without the Four Books, it is impossible to comprehend the subtlety of meanings; without the &quot;Yi,&quot; one cannot understand the changes of yin and yang; without the &quot;Suwen,&quot; one cannot recognize illnesses; without the &quot;Bencao,&quot; one cannot identify medicines; and without the &quot;Mai Jing,&quot; one has no method to diagnose and understand symptoms of cold, heat, deficiency, or excess. Sages have provided only a brief outline for people. Later scholars must integrate the strengths of various texts, apply what they observe in practice, and only then can they be deemed competent.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>There are six major failures in dealing with illness: failing to examine properly, failing to trust, being out of date, failing to choose the right physician, not understanding the disease, and not knowing the medicine. The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; states: Those who are arrogant and disregard reason will not be treated; those who value wealth over life will not be treated; those whose clothing and food are unsuitable will not be treated; those whose yin and yang and internal qi are unsettled will not be treated; those whose bodies are weak and cannot take medicine will not be treated; those who believe in shamans rather than physicians will not be treated. In today&#39;s society, these are the common issues faced by patients. </p>
<p>Sun Simiao said: Many sick people have friends and old acquaintances come to inquire about their illnesses, yet these individuals have no experience, have not read medical texts, and self-pretend to be knowledgeable. They speak nonconventional views, some say it is illusory, some say it is real, some say it is wind, some say it is qi, with a multitude of erroneous claims, all differing, which confuse the patient’s thoughts, leaving them unsure of what is true. Time does not wait for anyone, and disaster suddenly arrives, causing everyone to scatter. This kind of situation is particularly concerning nowadays.

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>The Meaning of Herbs</strong> 【Qing Dynasty, Yu Chang】</p>
<p><strong>First Discuss the Illness, Then Discuss the Medicine</strong></p>
<p>From ancient times to the present, each generation has its physicians, though they may differ in wisdom and stature, they must not abandon rules and standards to seek balance and clarity. Therefore, in treating illness, one must first understand the illness; only after understanding the illness can one discuss the medicine. Medicine is the means to overcome illness. If one understands the illness, they can choose one or two appropriate remedies from thousands of medicines, and these remedies will work effectively; if one does not understand the illness, there are many different approaches which may confuse the treatment. All medicines can harm a person, especially those that are the most obstinate.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been an increase in those studying medicine, yet medical practice has grown more chaotic, resulting in a world where medicine is discussed without consideration of the illness, which leads to countless tragedies. Some attribute this to fate, not knowing that the natural order does not favor killing or harming life. I often see families in officialdom, after a diagnosis, hastily prescribing a treatment to show their caution while failing to consider the source of the illness or how the medicine aligns with it; this leads physicians to resort to ambiguous discussions. When the medicine fails, they blame the lack of effective medicine, when in fact, effective medicines exist, but they do not dare to use them due to their ignorance of the disease.</p>
<p>Alas! Treatises like <em>Ling Shu</em>, <em>Su Wen</em>, <em>Nan Jing</em>, and <em>Jia Yi</em>, which contain fundamental principles, are seldom studied, while later works that do have prescriptions are venerated as treasures. For instance, Zhu Danxi&#39;s writing, <em>Pulse Diagnosis and Treatment</em>, discusses pulse first, then the cause, followed by symptoms, and lastly, treatment; yet this approach has fallen out of favor. Meanwhile, the book <em>Xing Fa</em> is filled with assorted prescriptions, forming a common doctrine.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; only describes the functions of medicinal properties, without addressing people&#39;s cravings. Additionally, the commentary by Miao includes both the virtues and flaws of these properties, which should necessarily be neglected. Without knowledge of the nature of plants and trees, we might take only a biased view to serve human needs, ignoring the flaws that need not be mentioned; many already discard such knowledge upon hearing it. Why not entirely revise the &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica,&quot; retaining only those medicines that are faultless, potentially fifty to seventy kinds, and use those? The intent in the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot; for physicians to gather toxic medicines for medical purposes, combined with the anxiety of past emperors regarding the completeness of the compendium, suggests a misunderstanding of this practice. To resolve this confusion, it is essential to discuss ailments in detail. When the nature of ailments is clearly understood, a specific ailment will coincide with specific medicines, even as diseases and medicines vary greatly. Beyond evolution&#39;s subtlety in nurturing life, identifying that a certain medicine is effective for a particular ailment, while another might be detrimental, leads to naming conventions. Without discussing ailments, how can we determine the efficacy and toxicity of medicines? It becomes evident that the notions of efficacy and toxicity in relation to medicines differ fundamentally from those related to bodily ailments. Those who are unaware insist on treating medicinal properties as fixed entities, which is quite narrow-minded. Therefore, Chang&#39;s discussions on ailments are not without necessity. In ancient times, experts on the platform could make clear predictions, and later generations would follow without fail; accumulating knowledge like a pile of rice, they ensured their earlier work was substantial. Though medicine may seem a minor path, it is no different. Chang, unable to change societal norms, truly desires to use this example to illuminate the mechanisms of diseases, examining what can be used and what cannot.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p>The discernment of suffering and joy in relation to the physical form is to observe the interplay between the seven emotions and the exertions of labor and rest. To understand the origins of ailments, one must examine the changes transmitted over time. Inquire about symptoms, remedies, and their effectiveness to refine one’s own insights. Day and night, the temperature variations can clarify the distinctions between the vital and blood systems. The conditions of food intake and bowel movements indicate the harmony of the stomach and intestines. The examination of the three regions and nine pulses reveals the locations of diseases in the twelve meridians. Observing the appearance of the twenty-four pulses sheds light on the balance of yin and yang, ensuring accuracy. When diagnosing based on the classics, correct naming leads to coherent statements, allowing actions to align with prescribed measures. The priority of the fundamental and the branch suggests an understanding of the relative significance of conditions. The methods of sweating, vomiting, purging, warming, and nourishing must be specific and precise. The differentiation of remedies involves careful selection considering size, urgency, and characteristics, avoiding randomness. The ten prescriptions encompass the suitable applications for circulation, nourishment, and other effects without generalization. Among the five qi, the essence of each flavor must be applied as the highest method in treatment: balancing cold, heat, warmth, coolness, and neutrality with sour, pungent, sweet, bitter, and salty flavors. The term &quot;add and subtract&quot; for decoctions implies adherence to ancient practices rather than personal improvisation. The timing of effects should be precisely delineated, considering the acute versus chronic nature of the illness, with the five elements determining the healing period. Thus, the distribution of medical cases in practice is determined by skill, accumulated over decades, able to treat millions with unwavering precision.<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a></p></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content"><p><strong>On Medicine</strong></p>
<p>In ancient times, quack doctors would take lives; in the present, while they do not kill, they also do not save lives, leaving patients caught between not living and not dying, allowing their illnesses to worsen until they eventually die. Medicine has its rulers and subjects, just as people have strengths and weaknesses. With rulers and subjects, the dosage varies; with strengths and weaknesses, the remedy is adjusted accordingly. Too much leads to specialization, and specialization results in quick effects; a greater dose thickens the remedy, deepening its power. However, those who use medicine today tend to mix indiscriminately and prescribe uniformly, failing to discern clearly or treat boldly, which is why illnesses cannot be cured. Yet society regards merely not killing as a sign of virtue, unaware that the great doctors of old could not afford to make mistakes. The &quot;Book of Rites&quot; states that physicians at the end of the year should evaluate their medical practices to determine their sustenance: achieving ten successes is the highest, ten failures once earns a lower rank, and so on. Despite having three or four failures, ancient people still employed such doctors. Even Chunyu Yi, responding to Emperor Xiaowen, noted that mistakes are made from time to time, and it is impossible for ministers to be perfect in their duties. The &quot;I Ching&quot; states: &quot;The insect of abundance comes to see misfortune.&quot;<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a></p></div>

<p>According to Xu Yinzong in the &quot;Book of Tang&quot;: The great physicians of ancient times focused exclusively on distinguishing pulses; once the pulse was precisely identified, they then recognized the illness. The relationship between illness and medicine is such that there is a correct match—one needs only to use a single remedy that directly targets the illness. When the potency of the medicine is pure, the illness will promptly recover. Nowadays, people cannot distinguish pulses and their understanding of the source of illness is based solely on personal conjecture, often overloading the medicinal flavors, akin to a hunt where one does not know of the rabbit&#39;s location, scattering men and horses in vain hopes of capturing one, making the strategy ineffective. Suppose a certain medicine happens to suit the illness; if other flavors interfere, the energy and action are impeded, thus making it difficult to differentiate; this is indeed the reason. </p>
<p>In the &quot;Book of the Later Han,&quot; it is said that Hua Tuo excelled in formulas and used only a few types of medicines. A master catalogues six or five, relying on nine or two would predict success, while combining three or four would indicate failure. Therefore, when there are too many officials, there is disorder; when there are too many troops, there is defeat; matters of the world are likewise.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a></p></div>
