      <div>One Grass Pavilion’s Complete Treatise on the Arts, by Deng Yuan.<br/>
<br/>
Year Order:<br/>
<br/>
Of the human body’s five senses, only the ears and eyes are particularly important, and among those governing hearing, the eyes are most esteemed. Though the eyes are opened to the liver’s orifices, the essence of the five viscera is all channeled into them, forming the pupils. Therefore, those practicing longevity cultivate inner vision and quiet contemplation, employing the method of gazing at candles, but only when inner nourishment is sufficient and external disturbances are avoided will the eyes remain clear and bright.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a> Or, when exposed to the assault of frost and sun, or invaded by summer heat, injury occurs externally. Or, when grief and anger injure the liver, exhausting the vital blood, injury occurs internally. Thus, when seeking treatment for illness, one inevitably becomes afflicted with lifelong blindness, all stemming from the hands of physicians. Caution must be taken.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a> Surely among all those who can pierce the mist and see the blue sky, who are they, these talented individuals?  Leaving aside Deng Zi of the Clear River, who is equal to him in return? I once observed that a man, in a secluded pavilion, could master all subjects, and that his connection to medicine began with the need to understand the opinions of the Song scholars regarding the proper conduct of a son; therefore, such a man is truly filial.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a> And even if Fan Gong did not become a good minister, it would still be the purpose of a good physician. If one is determined within oneself, then that person is virtuous. A virtuous person devoted to benevolence and filial piety, exhausts his skill in medicine, and there is no domain in which he does not create [effects].<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a> Once he had established his arguments and prescribed remedies, meticulously dissecting internal and external causes, with detailed and comprehensive analysis of odd and even principles, and a thorough understanding of the specialized and precise methods. Furthermore, the knowledge he transmitted was far beyond the ordinary, so he invariably tested and verified his prescriptions. Alas, the dates and pears were left incomplete, and the book was not passed down; I have possessed this book hidden within my ancestral estate for a long time.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a> Now one dares not indulge self-interest, re-engraving the sharp blades, honoring it in this age, not as a laudable example of a virtuous and filial son, but also for posterity throughout the world; for those who endure hardship and illness, to discern the proper treatment and achieve recovery, without relying on internal observation, it can certainly preserve the most vital of the five senses, and without concerning oneself with the damage of wind, frost, or anger and stagnation; this is the preface.<br/>

Kangxi Year of the Ding You, Chrysanthemum Month, Guangning Year, Xi Hao wrote at the Imperial Office in Jinling.<br/>

<br/>
A woman’s having eyes is like the heavens’ having the sun and moon.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a> If the sky were without sun and moon, how could one discern yin and yang. If a person were without eyes, how could one distinguish the colors of things. Therefore, the eyes are the official responsible for vision, and the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are all connected to them.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a> Then, can the eyes also be obscured and not understood? Alas, many of the world’s ailments arise from obscured vision, some from intoxication and indulgence, others from wind and heat producing clouding, and without a good remedy, how can it be cured? However, a good remedy is not a good physician, and it cannot be used effectively.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a> I once heard that Master Su had said that even if medicine is administered by a physician’s hand, the prescriptions are often derived from ancient texts; this is a profound truth. Now, the “Three-Finger Zen” practitioner, merely mimicking the intentions of a physician, without investigating the root of the illness and rashly prescribing drugs, has resulted in lifelong blindness; this is truly regrettable. One then considers a town of ten households, surely there are trustworthy people, and the entire world, does it lack good physicians?<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a> He was able to revive the blind and destitute, and wandered freely beneath the sun and sky, his achievements were truly great. Hu Zhiqu, Magistrate of Zhifang, a talented man under the jurisdiction of the Gou clan, had formerly served in the Wu and Chu states, administering many benevolent policies. Later, he was transferred to Sha County as the Governor of Min, deeply gaining the favor of the local populace with his skillful methods, and the people’s sentiments were harmonious; when I reflect upon it, wherever he went, music and songs flourished. I have traveled with him for ten years, yet I did not know the extent of his learning, which encompassed no less than five thousand volumes, nor did I know that he was proficient in the art of岐黄学 (Qi Huang Xue – the Yellow River and Yellow Emperor medical texts).<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a> Because there was a sickness within the family, no physician was consulted outside, and I suspected something was amiss. A patient with a troubled breathing, near death, occurred frequently among the people of Jing. Someone said that the magistrate could cure it, so he was brought to my dwelling, and a prescription was administered to him, and he ultimately relied on it for recovery; was the magistrate the successor of Bian Que?<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a> He presented the hand-printed volumes of the *Muye* series, published by Yu Kui-zai, followed by the seventy-two supplementary *Muye* answers, compiled into a single volume and meticulously revised, named *Enlightenment True Meaning*. It was stored for many years, and he did not wish to display its peculiarities privately, so he entrusted it to lead type for the benefit of those with shared interests. Then he asked me to write an introduction.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a> I am filled with shame and inadequacy, unskilled in medical knowledge, and dare not even preface this book. Alas, this is truly seeking wisdom from the blind. Now, looking at the book’s organization lacking any disorder, its meaning comprehensively encompassing, and its method of application, it is clear this cannot be the work of a simple observer; it is truly fortunate that I have seen it.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a> Today, unfolding this scroll, I immediately understood its meaning, and I privately thought it was not merely to enlighten one person, but to enlighten a thousand people in the world. The magistrate, naming this book based on the true meaning of enlightenment, who could disagree? <br/>

On the first day after the Lamp Festival in the eighth year of the reign of the Emperor Guangxu, Cao Jinchi carefully inscribed this preface at his residence west of Green Bamboo Tree City.<br/>

In my spare time reading, I enjoy exploring various arts, a habit from my youth.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a> Formerly, the school of Qi Huang, though superficially understanding the great principles, despite not being fully skilled, would occasionally examine evidence and consult the ancients, resulting in a practice steeped in blindness. I investigated ancient formulas, treating a hundred illnesses without any effect; did the ancients deceive me? Or did I choose them without thorough understanding and apply them without spirit?<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a> Or perhaps the art of diagnosis possesses a hidden truth, a truth the ancients had not yet revealed, and now there are many who are nearly blind but still worthy of pity; why then should it be only I who possess this knowledge! A friend named someone-’s name unspecified – showed me a copy of the complete ‘Eye Chart’ (or ‘Eye Chart’ – the term is unclear), stating that it was collected by the family over many generations, and merely to test its efficacy. I examined it, finding it to be two volumes combined with the copy, the first volume titled ‘Complete Works of the ‘One Grass Pavilion’ Eye Chart,’ written by Mr. Deng Boguang, which widely draws upon various methods, and meticulously discusses their subtle distinctions. I understand that it is a treasure for those who are nearly blind.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a> After this was recorded, it was called *Strange Granting of Insight*, and it revealed profound wisdom, beautiful intent, and complete perfection. It was supremely secluded and hidden, impossible to imitate. Then, he cultivated his son’s spirit, selecting and treating his eyes, and within ten days, the darkness and light were restored, like the beginning.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a> I then suddenly realized that the book truly did offer benefit to the world, and it was then that I clearly understood its true meaning. I thereupon resolved to make medicine and administer it to the poor and blind, and by doing so, I was promoted to the position of official in the淮 region. I had no time to attend to this, in the year of庚午, I received an order to suppress the chaos in Jǐngjiāng, accompanied by my colleague Yang, I abandoned medicine, restored his clarity, and then, to the astonishment of all, people from far and wide came seeking treatment, the most efficacious formulas in the book were used as both primary and auxiliary medicines.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a> Then he expended considerable expense, but it did not yield results. I, being poor and lacking the ability to prepare things, merely repaired and combined the four parts of the lu-gan-shi stone, and it produced no ill effects. Afterwards, I was transferred to the province of Min, where I served as a clerk, never raising any objections to others.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a> In the autumn of the Jia Mao year of the Emperor Guangxu, Chen Xu and Zhong An were both taking medicine, and the number of those recovering was beyond enumeration. Guang Ning’s Year Official, Ou Zhai, who had served during the Kangxi Dynasty, once lamented the dilapidated and incomplete Ru Cheng Ting, intending to preserve it for printing. He feared the disappearance of the original edition of *Yi Shu* would erase the effort of its creation.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a> For two hundred years now, up to the present day, I have obtained copies, copies made by transcription with errors, and these copies are exceedingly numerous. I sought to verify their authenticity by inquiring throughout the printing shops, but without success. Because the original seals are now scarce, and have long since been lost to time, moreover, they have been ravaged by war. I, with my humble understanding, have dared to correct them against their original intent, lightly editing and rectifying them; those who cannot agree with my corrections have noted them separately, allowing those who wish to use them to employ them sparingly.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a> Having reflected on the wisdom of Liang Bo and Wang Zhu, as well as the later practitioners of Jing Huang, one wonders whether the passing of many centuries has led to a distortion of their teachings. Alas, now that I am nearing my old age, I regret not having fully utilized my youth in learning and serving, and all my efforts have failed to produce lasting, monumental works. I took this book and attempted to benefit the world, but to what extent can one truly achieve this? Furthermore, I deeply worry about the loss of its transmission over time. Therefore, I have endeavored to publish it, hoping to continue its line. I have also included other experiences and strange methods, offering them to posterity, declaring this to be the “True Essence of Enlightenment,” and thus naming the book accordingly, allowing each to retain their original practices, designating it as the “Department of Distinct Types,” and distributing it to the people.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a> Let all those who rule the world not be blind, and let them wander freely in the bright, radiant heavens, like the sun in the middle of the day, without experiencing any trouble or suffering. This is a profound blessing. Those who possess extraordinary and wondrous methods, though their effects may only be demonstrated briefly in two instances, have already been tested a hundred times, and their efficacy is great. Readers should not dismiss them lightly.<br/>

Eighth Year of the Reign of the Emperor Guangxu, Year of the Wood Snake, Month of the Wood Spring. Order of Zhang.<br/>

From Han Ziyu of Changli: “Do not be influenced by what has come before, even if it is beautiful, do not conceal it; do not be influenced by what has come after, even if it is magnificent, do not transmit it.”<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a> This is a truly remarkable statement; it has persisted through countless generations, and if it were not so, those who labored diligently in the past would not have achieved anything, while those who followed merely watched their demise. It does not follow the example of the ancients, and thus, how many are blind, failing to understand the consequences? Therefore, a magnanimous and discerning gentleman should, especially, focus his mind upon this situation, and there is good reason to do so.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a> Shi Qian completed his book, and his preface was titled “Hidden in the Famous Mountains,” transmitting it to various people. Alas, how difficult it was to obtain such people. Gouchuan Hu Gong, the scholar Ziqiao, was studious and admired the ancients, possessed broad skills and was capable.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a> Since the pursuit of learning is like valuing life itself, one regrets the loss of skills as if it were one’s own life. Since one admires the ancients, one fears the obscurity of the past and seeks to emulate it. The knowledge and abilities possessed are beyond expectation, and their extent is impossible to measure. Now, specifically, we endeavor to clarify the true meaning of this matter.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a> He raised a ladle, wishing to measure it with the whole world. “The true meaning of enlightenment” consists of summarizing the two families’ eye-examination names. One was written by Deng Bo-wang’s disciple, Shi Yao, and includes “Complete Book of Eye Examinations.” The original manuscript was incomplete, and its author is unknown. The other was written by someone named “Xi Yao,” preserved between heaven and earth, possessing techniques for dispersing clouds and clearing mist. During the reign of the Emperor Kangxi, Shi Yao’s book was reprinted, and “Xi Yao’s” book was also carved and produced. Now, it cannot be found in its original form; alas, its learning is lost.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a> I possess a wild and unrestrained nature, unwilling to remain in a settled place, and have long enjoyed wandering. I have also come into contact with many wealthy scholars. When I pass by and see things—the dazzling splendor of brocades and jewels, the overflowing abundance of treasures, bizarre and fantastical sights—I invariably find them to be so. However, I regard them with contempt as if blind, my eyes straight ahead, yet I regard them as if blind, and furthermore, I truly am blind.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a> Alas, alas! Who has caused all such people to be so few in their knowledge, and yet has blinded them thus? In the eighteenth year of the Xingshen era of the Emperor Guangxu, I lay in the Dragon’s sleep, entered Fujian, and found only Hu Guiuan to be agreeable. I restrained my affairs in the hall, and painted a few works of calligraphy, painting, and numbers, the arrangement was sparse and simple, yet close to the ancient style.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a> He bowed and sat down to converse, his appearance was profoundly earnest, and everything he said possessed substance. He withdrew, and it was as if it had vanished. He said it could open my blindness. He had no dwelling, and did not know where the Gūchuan was to be taken for him. He approached and stayed in his home, ordering his youngest son to study the texts. The sun and moon had passed beyond their limits, and the cold and heat had undergone two transformations since then; it was since he first came to this dwelling.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a> He disregarded him there, yet suddenly was alarmed by him here. What was the reason for this change? He entered his study and merely read his books there, and he rested in his room and read his books there.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a> On Lanhuan Mountain Shelf. A tangle of toothpicks accumulated. It appeared as if precious jewels and fine fabrics were piled there.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a> Then it multiplied its strangeness and eccentricity tenfold. At the end. It added to it.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a> As I had resided in my dwelling for a long time, I gradually came to fully understand the profoundness of the classics, was proficient in historical records, and examined the myriad sayings of the Hundred Schools of Thought, particularly with a deep interest in the teachings of Qi Huang, and this was not merely a special case. Especially noteworthy were the stars, divination through chess and strategy, geomancy for selecting residences, and the methods of divination through the examination of the *Xi Shi* and *Shao Shi*, as well as the casting of *guijian* and *shaoshi*. I was particularly skilled in the interpretation of the *guijian* and *shaoshi*, and I could accurately discern beauty and ugliness, good and evil, righteousness and wickedness, and fortune and misfortune, all of which were laid bare before me and could not escape their forms.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a> The divine peak raised all under heaven to prosperity, longevity, and death, returning to the palm of one’s hand; the principle of warfare was attempted, and it was tried. Killing bandits in Lake Xiang brought about a world without use, and the secret of the Gū River remained hidden, with no talk of it. All of this was, in fact, also the splendor and treasure of the Gū River, the strangeness and irregularity within his breast—it was not merely the teachings of the Yellow Springs.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a> The scholars of the Six Schools and the Ocean of Learning, having been meticulously edited, are now presented with earnestness and intensity, solely for the preservation of ancient, exceptional teachings for me. Alas, lamentable! The learned and insightful, having been utterly discontinued, yet now resumed for the present time, if it were not for the virtue of those who seek knowledge and admire antiquity, for the talent and ability of Jiu Chuan, what would be gained through transmission? If this book were merely entrusted to others, those who would not recognize its value and cherish it, it would be left upon shelves, decaying from dampness and vermin, becoming utterly ruined, cast into forgotten storerooms, subjected to fire and water—who would inquire about it?<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a> He knew that knowledge was valuable, so he concealed and guarded it closely, living in seclusion and privately holding his skills. He excelled in using his skills throughout the world, curing the blind and opening the eyes of the world, causing all to marvel at his extraordinary and unparalleled abilities. Thus, he expanded his fame, and his pursuit of knowledge also converged on its end. Now, he concealed his knowledge in the mountains, and among the two types of people who transmitted it, were they truly those people? Now, Gūchuā cherished it deeply, fearing it, lamented the imminent loss of his art, and yet also feared its being lost to oblivion, he retrieved and published it widely throughout the world, and it was transmitted.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a> The learned men of Bo Wang, not merely achieved a great prosperity in their time, but those who afterward, if they diligently refine their arts and skillfully employ their beauty, all follow the “True Essence of Enlightenment” as their doctrine. Holding an art to achieve fame, that art will certainly become manifest. Alas, one man, Gūchuān, in his ear, went to the past, followed it, and served as a foundation for the future; truly desiring to hold it, he did not blindly follow the world. The world can then measure it.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a> Alas, alas! I, with a loose and wild nature, wish to announce to the world: those who are blind, should not deny their blindness; those who are not blind, should not stubbornly resist the blind. Preserve your eyes, and you may also preserve your heart.<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a> The years had passed long ago, and the original text was rarely seen, so those that had been transmitted were chiefly printed copies. Recently, the Shenglan Pavilion has printed it using wooden block printing, and a limited number of blocks were produced, but without those blocks, it could not be reprinted. Once purchased, the books could not be obtained.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a> In the book, various methods, having undergone diligent imitation and treatment, yielded remarkable results, repeatedly being compiled and published to extend their influence. During the winter of the seventh year of the Great Shun, while seeking refuge in a military encampment, I encountered my uncle’s son, Xu Jun Ding, and, discussing matters with him and those who shared a common purpose, we followed the model of the shares issued, jointly undertaking a fundraising effort. Once the book was printed and republished, not only were the afflicted and blind people delighted to see the sky and sun again, but the book was also used to ensure its continued dissemination.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a> All who rely on [this] method gain what supports them, illuminating it with spirit, and maturing it to the utmost longevity. How shallow and fleeting is this! This is the introduction.<br/>
<br/>
In the Year of the Xin Chou, Spring, the Twenty-Seventh Year of the Reign of the Emperor Guangxu, Yao Bao Bo Chun Fu humbly introduces this.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning the Treatise:<br/>
<br/>
It is written: The essence of the five internal organs and six viscera is all channeled upwards to the eyes.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a> The essence of bone constitutes the pupil, belonging to the kidney. The essence of sinew constitutes black pearls, belonging to the liver. The essence of blood constitutes networks, belonging to the heart.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a> The essence of air becomes white pearls, belonging to the lungs. The essence of flesh becomes restraint, belonging to the spleen. The vital essence of blood and air is connected by the vital essence arteries, upper belonging to the brain, and afterward emerging from the neck.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a> If one is afflicted by repeated sexual indulgence and external ailments, emotional distress, irregular diet, excessive labor, all can damage the eyes. For the eyes connect with the liver’s channels and the kidneys store their essence; once there is suppressed vexation, the inner fire will accompany the liverwood and ascend, resulting in a multitude of seventy-two symptoms. Altogether, it does not exceed the two barriers of inside and outside.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a> The eye, like a jade ornament, has the pupil situated in the center and forward, resembling the splendor of the sun and moon as they shine southeast and are obscured northwest. There is spirit paste, spirit water, spirit light, true blood, true air, and true essence; this is the nourishing fluid of the eye. Spirit paste is the paste within the eye, and its decline causes damage.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a> Divine water originates from the three channels and springs forth, a manifestation of the primordial true unity of vital energy; it is the moisture that nourishes the eyes. When water diminishes, there is the danger of fire overcoming dryness and excessive heat. When water is exhausted, there is the affliction of eye wheel size abnormalities. Exhaustion and stagnation bring the peril of blurred vision. Deficiency predominates, while fullness is rare. Therefore, there are no eyes that are entirely clear. Divine light originates from the Conception Gate, flows into the gallbladder, and emanates from the heart; it is the function of fire. When fire diminishes, there is the danger of blurred vision. Excessive fire brings the calamity of burning and drying.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a> The ruler of the heart, understanding the great, therefore the Great Red is reality. The vital orifice is the heart, and the heart is the fire within it. It executes the commands of the ruler, understanding the small, therefore the Small Red is illusionary fire. If the ruler is properly maintained, then the inner fire will naturally be clear and tranquil.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a> True blood is that which arises from the liver, ascending with the flow, nourishing the eyes, and marking the channels. This blood is not that which easily flows between muscles, but rather the water that is born of Heaven, therefore it is called true. True air is that which goes to and fro within the channels of the eyes, generating and sustaining the flow, and is the original Yang born of the primordial true essence.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a> The truly refined essence originates from the primal energy of the first and second heavens, transformed into essence. It arises from the kidneys, is then applied to the gallbladder, and subsequently reaches the spirit eyes. Should any of these factors be damaged, the eyes will become ill. Wulu Zi said: “The eyes are born of primordial air, formed by post-natal air, contain the mysteries of yin and yang, and the essence of water and fire.”<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a> Blood nourishes water, water nourishes fat, fat protects the eye spirit, air serves for application, spirit is the maintenance itself.  Thus, the sun and moon, they harmonize reality; the human body is the most precious treasure, and it should be valued accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
The eyes belong to the liver, and the liver is associated with wood. East is associated with wood, and wood generates wind. The liver responds to the eyes, and excessive anger causes internal stagnation. Furthermore, wind heat invades the eye spirit, resulting in symptoms arising from constant anger, overwork, external exposure to wind and cold, and internal indulgence in sensual desires, leading to dizziness, blurred vision, and ultimately, a state of dimness.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a> The head and limbs belong to the heart; the heart is the fire. The heart governs the protective layers named the Sovereign; blood pursues the fire, rushing into the eyes and congealing there. The head’s expansion and contraction are like fireflies; distant viewing and returning to the same are both fireflies. Because of sorrow, vexation, fatigue, grief, and thought, injury is inflicted upon the heart, and attack is made upon the eyes. The red channels irrigate the pupil; the flesh clings to the eye; if this persists for a long time, it gradually leads to blindness.<br/>
<br/>
The upper and lower viscera belong to the spleen; the spleen is the earth. The Sun belongs to the earth and governs the origin of the spleen’s disease; the upper and lower viscera swell and are red, and when a needle is inserted, the thread clings to the eye.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a> The condition arose from excessive consumption of hot foods, spiced with acrid flavors, resulting in internal heat accumulation, blood stasis with swelling and pain, obstruction of grains and seeds, and a persistent, intractable illness that eventually led to the rupture of tendons, corneal ulceration, and chronic, prolonged suffering.<br/>
<br/>
The White Pearl (likely referring to a specific herbal remedy) belongs to the Lung, which is an organ of gold. The Lung was attacked by the heat of the heart, manifesting as a slight redness of the eyes veiled by a dark, crimson gauze.  Treatment involved administering cooling, aromatic agents to clear the intestines.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a> The condition arose from exposure to frost and snow, resulting in hunger and fullness becoming irregular, invasion of external wind-evil, internal heat ascending to attack the head, prolonged illness without remedy, ultimately leading to a state of confusion regarding vision, the formation of a white film obscuring the eyes, severe pain in opening them, and the emergence of tears due to wind-evil.<br/>
<br/>
The pupil belongs to the kidney, and the kidney governs water. Furthermore, the kidney channels the gallbladder, reflecting the principle of wood and water mutually generating; therefore, the liver and kidney share a common therapeutic approach.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a> The kidneys and gallbladder originate from the same source, and the essence tends upward. When the yin is deficient and fire is excessive, beautiful flowers spontaneously bloom. Ascending of the spirit fluid results in a green hue. To quickly nourish and restore the source is not to be lamented. The condition arises from excessive desires, overexertion of the vital organs, great shock to the mind, and profound fear, damaging the will. With yin and fire depleted, the balance of yin and yang is diminished, cold tears flow upon the face, flowers fly before the eyes, green water fills the pupils, and the vision becomes blurred due to damage to the inner membrane.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a> External obstructions cause the eyes to burst forth with pain, difficult to open, the pain spreads, shame fearing the light. White pearls grow into sores, millet sand hides the obstruction, swollen eyelids fester, the hair of the fist turns to lash out at the eyelashes. The flesh distorts the eyes, the red tendons pierce the pupil, the membrane obscures the eyes, the curtain veils the visual field.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a> The wind caused weeping from the eyes, the eyes leaked pus, fever with poisonous influence occurred, the black eyeballs sank. The black eyeballs protruded, manifesting when stimulated, fetal membranes produced gelatinous substance, the wind caused a skewing. The eyes of the sparrow were constricted, the eye was pierced, blood flooded the pupil, dust injured the eyes.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a> The eyes were inflamed with roots, the eyelids hard and swollen, the pupils painful and constricted, the inflammation was thick and sluggish. The small redness was painful, the large redness was painful. Ice-wheel opacity, plum blossom opacity, spiral shell opacity, floating opacity, solid opacity, moist opacity, dry opacity, nail-head opacity, white opacity, red opacity, green opacity, yellow opacity, black opacity, the inflammation would appear and disappear.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a> Within, tension and excess; without, relaxation and deficiency. This causes injuries through stumbling and falling.<br/>
<br/>
The treatment of external obstructions:<br/>
<br/>
The world says that eye diseases are caused by wind, but they are not caused by external wind. The eyes will not become diseased. Because the meridians are restrained by wind, the internal fire cannot be released, it is carried by the liver and wood, and rushes upwards to the eye orifices; the blood follows the fire, resulting in red eyes.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a> Prompt and timely treatment brings complete recovery. If treatment is delayed and ineffective, it is due to errors in the rough work, resulting in external obstructions and similar symptoms. These external obstructions are caused by wind stagnation, heat accumulation, and blood stasis, and the treatment should focus on removing wind, dispersing heat, and activating the blood, utilizing the Golden Liquid Decoction as the primary remedy, with external application of Jade Flower Powder to achieve self-healing.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a> If the eyes are obscured by a membrane, use a purple and golden ointment transmitted from immortals to apply to them; this ointment can dispel blindness, or Wu Dang, Ren Long, and this person also possess a skillful method.<br/>

<br/>
Treatment of Internal Obstruction<br/>
<br/>
Internal obstruction is caused by the failure to make the pupils red and swollen; if not treated with attention over a long period, it becomes a chronic illness.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a> The spirit resides in the kidney, and it also penetrates the gallbladder and liver. This faculty of the spirit is the most sensitive within the human body. The kidney is also the most vital organ within the body, reflecting the principle that the essence of the liver and kidney originate from the same source. Humans possess either deficiency of yin or deficiency of yang.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a> Deficiency of Yin results in water failing to nourish wood; with insufficient Yang fire, the liver and wood ascend in heat, the liver’s channels for the eyes become diseased, and the eyes are thus afflicted. The kidney vessel is like the Taiji diagram, containing both water and fire. The right kidney belongs to Yang water, the left kidney to Yin water, and the Dantian contains a small fire.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a> Those who possess little fire are yang, with one yang falling into two yin within, forming the image of Kun (the North Pole). Thus, the I Ching says that Heaven generates one substance of water. Water and fire are harmonious, all channels are open, yet the spleen earth does not arise from lack of fire, the liver wood does not nourish from lack of kidney water, the spleen’s energy is sufficient, and the lungs’ metal arises spontaneously, the liver’s energy is cultivated spontaneously, and the heart fire then operates, so that the kidneys become the source of the five viscera. This is what is meant by primordial true energy, which gives rise to the body and establishes life; it is all contained within this state. Therefore, without water, the master of water is used to restrain the sun’s light.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a> Those lacking fire benefit from diminishing the shadows as a source of fire, not merely curing the eyes, and the same principle can be applied to various illnesses. This water and fire are formless water and formless fire, namely the original true yin and true yang. When yin is deficient, supplement yin; when yang is deficient, supplement yang. By consulting the pulse, one may avoid misdiagnosis.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a> The afflicted with inner obstructions experience diminished spirit, deficient qi, and weakened kidneys; treatment should focus on nourishing blood, replenishing yin, calming the spirit, and promoting clear vision. It is necessary to primarily use Jia Gan Di Huang Wan, taken on an empty stomach, combined with the intake of Five Treasures Pills, taken after meals, resulting in remarkable efficacy.

Of the human body’s five senses, only the ears and eyes are particularly important, and among those governing hearing, the eyes are most esteemed. Though the eyes are opened to the liver’s orifices, the essence of the five viscera is all channeled into them, forming the pupils. Therefore, those practicing longevity cultivate inner vision and quiet contemplation, employing the method of gazing at candles, but only when inner nourishment is sufficient and external disturbances are avoided will the eyes remain clear and bright.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></div>

One was written by Deng Bo-wang’s disciple, Shi Yao, and includes “Complete Book of Eye Examinations.” The original manuscript was incomplete, and its author is unknown. The other was written by someone named “Xi Yao,” preserved between heaven and earth, possessing techniques for dispersing clouds and clearing mist. During the reign of the Emperor Kangxi, Shi Yao’s book was reprinted, and “Xi Yao’s” book was also carved and produced.
