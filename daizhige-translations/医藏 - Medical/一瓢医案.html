      <div>A Case of Medicine<br/>
<br/>
清·薛雪生 White’s Edition, 清·Wu Jinshou’s Phonetic Revision<br/>
<br/>
The bones are small, the flesh brittle; certainly not the appearance of pine or cypress. The pulse is numerous and then ceases, already revealing the signs of exhaustion. Weakness from birth combined with a deficiency of fluids, followed by vigorous heat and dryness of metal. The annual environment causes a continuous depletion; how can it be allowed to continue? The autumn wind’s sudden introduction has already caused injury, and it is unavoidable. The symptoms are as described above; the medicine is solely to nourish the north, not to claim it is a dream, merely to alleviate the vexation: *生地* (shanbei), *沙参* (shasan), *地骨皮* (tieli gupi), *麦冬* (ma dong), *金石斛* (jinshuhuo), *生鳖甲* (sheng bietjia).<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a> The emissary of Suluk, having long coughed and been unable to lie down, discerned the eight winds and measured the nature of the five lands. His disposition, generally, favored the巽 (east-south) direction, ahead of the箕 (spoon) tail, beyond the 翼 (wing) and轸 (wheel), with excessive yang energy that readily leaked out; even a slight wind chill easily weakened and dispersed him. Upon arriving in the Hua Xia (China), he already belonged to the three yang meridians. Moreover, since he could not lie down, his lung qi was severely injured, and the only appropriate treatment was to moisten and descend it: honey-baked枇杷 (loquat) leaves, 麦冬 (snow lotus), 川贝 (Chinese magnolia bark), sweet杏仁 (apricot kernel), frost-stricken 桑 (mulberry) leaves, and 米仁 (rice kernel).<br/>
<br/>
《内经》 states that those with bones and flesh that are soft and brittle possess a fundamentally weak constitution. However, considering the pulse diagnosis, his cough originated from the hand’s 太阴 (yin) energy.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a> Hearing one person mended it, another loosened it; if it was hot, it rose from the mending; if it was deficient, it became empty from the loosening. Eventually, soldiers emerged from the temple and soldiers entered the shore. Also, a discussion of the roots, to share a common laugh:<br/>
<br/>
Polygonum cuspidatum (North Sand Ginseng), Ectocarpus (Bird&#39;s Nest), Mulberry Leaves, Ice Sugar, Caragana Root (Chuanbei), Aster.<br/>
<br/>
The lower abdomen swells and rises like a hill, extending upwards to the heart, causing a reversal of the vital energy. When acute, it resists with great force, but cannot be compelled; when deficient, it falls downwards, and cannot be forced to struggle.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a> A twitch here, a spasm there, rising and falling, and even the movement of the body from head to foot is like grinding grain with a pestle. The blood from the mouth and nostrils, overflowing upwards and downwards, could not be treated by all physicians. I thought this illness was recorded in the *Nan Jing*, and therefore have not clarified it for the people. Furthermore, it is said: “This object, when lodged near the navel, upwards and downwards, causes little discomfort; when it enters the navel, it causes little peace.” Thus, the two points near the navel are also in accordance with this statement, and it is sufficient that it be left for the public to think about and discover it themselves.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a> Thin mint decoction was administered upon descent, accompanied by mysterious pills. The patient himself reflected upon drinking this decoction, and its ingredients remained motionless, therefore it was used. Long-standing deficiencies are not merely attributed by the patient himself; even those who practice medicine, also recognize them in retrospect. When the wind and wood energies are in their strongest phase, the eyes become yellow, and then seminal and fluid imbalances manifest. Shortly thereafter, the knees and shins swell with pain, rendering movement impossible.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a> Upon examination, the pulse was weak and irregular on the left, strong and prolonged on the right, the face was deeply purple and frequently vomited. After carefully considering the cause, previous recurrent illnesses, all stemmed from a single pathogenic factor, manifesting as three distinct diseases progressing in a protracted manner. From above downwards, and from below upwards to the most extreme, due to a fundamental constitution long disturbed, it manifested as a disease of the stomach, a consequence of the relatedness of the kidneys and stomach. Should it not be gently relieved and corrected by removing a few of the symptoms, and returning the yang to its root, I fear it would be like the suffering at the Sword Gate, and there would be no restoration like that of the Han Dynasty. I propose a method, loosely following the example of Danxi, and I wonder if it will prove effective: *Camel Horn*, *Pawpaw*, *Wine-fried Yellow Phoebe*, *Vdragon Liver*, *Rice Bean Seed*, *Citrus Red*, *Horse Bean*.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a> The illness, once severe, recovered as if from the horns of a roe deer or the fur of a rabbit. One might knock upon jade platforms and jasper gates, seeking a single gleam of gold, and perhaps thus be pleased.<br/>
<br/>
Small building of Zhong Tang.<br/>
<br/>
The pulse was three parts on the right, a rapid, string-like sound, with a concurrent swelling; on the left, a count upwards from the middle, firm. Previously, the deficiency was in Yang Jing (essence) not rising; subsequently, it affected the Yang Luo (channels) not being fixed. It is because the Yin generates Yang, and there is a loss of Jing, that this is congenital; when Yang emerges from Yin, and there is a fever with red tongue, this is acquired.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a> The signs of the beginning of form herald the illness of both the prior and posterior heavens. Thus, even the body, possessing the utmost residue of genuine existence, is insufficient to sustain its gradual depletion. Now, shall we administer a thick, potent flavor to enter the shadows, or a thin, clear flavor of yang? I fear that the mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees are all inadequate to restore the golden essence.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a> Do not rely solely on the great medicine, golden pills; attend to the cyclical changes of heat and cold. However, it is also necessary to supplement with the method of taking food and medicine; it was modeled after the esteemed teachers, and ultimately I was humbled by the drum. I seek understanding:<br/>
<br/>
Build a lotus paste of one *jin* (with the heart intact, like a large poppy seed, steamed and dried nine times to make powder), *mài dòng* (meat) one *jin*, tender lotus leaves half a *jin*, *dǐngzhī* (top knot mushroom) four *liang*, and *jīn yīngzi* (golden cherry seeds) half a *jin* (with the hairs removed).<br/>
<br/>
These four ingredients are simmered into a paste, then mixed with lotus powder using a mortar and pestle to form pills, and five *qián* of autumn stone soup are added.<br/>
<br/>
Depression suddenly ceases and stagnates; boredom and listlessness arise, and the twelve organs lack control, thus yin and yang become intertwined.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a> Administer a heavy dose of iron sand, mugwort, benstone, bitter jujube, orange peel, and fo-tuck.<br/>
<br/>
The positive pole rises without entering, the negative energy sinks without adhering; therefore, there is day without night, it is clear without light, and it sleeps at noon; the water is gradually declining. Treat it by harmonizing yin and yang, and drawing the Wei into the palace. Do not say that the use of half-summer [half-summer] is forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
Half-summer, red dates, angelica root, polygonatum, licorice root, sticky rice, fo-tuck, rice kernels, and clarified musk.<br/>
<br/>
During the heat and summer, the pathogenic factors invade for twenty days.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a> Given the available ingredients, why inquire about a specific path with Jianzu (a patient with a specific ailment)? Having already received a warm, humid influence, strive with all your might and sweat profusely while composing a prescription:<br/>
<br/>
Ligusticum chuanxiong, Artemisia annua, powdered radix Glycyrrhizae glabra, Danggui (Polygoni radix acanthi), Fuzite (Fuzite Radix), powdered Zingiber officinarum.<br/>
<br/>
This illness originated from a deficiency of the vital energy that harmonizes the stomach and intestines. To address this deficiency, one must utilize the vital energy of the Great Harmony, which is inherent in the energy of Heaven and Earth, nurturing all things. It is rare to experience a significant deficiency, and to suffer such a loss is entirely inappropriate.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a> My humble opinion should be dismissed entirely; cultivate a secluded mountain study with excessive nourishment, feeding it with medicine and stone; withdraw completely from the world, hoping for a sudden, vigorous recovery. It is not a suitable activity to be engaged in while writing on a goose-feather brush in a lotus-screened room. I have heard that virtuous men bestow words upon others and affection upon them; this is the origin of such frivolous pursuits:<br/>
<br/>
Turn over lotus blossoms, pumpkin, young sprouts of wheat, scorched herbs, substitute stone, white peony root, rice paste.<br/>
<br/>
After the illness worsened following the autumn equinox, many physicians were consulted; in the mornings, he spoke of fever, and in the evenings, he discussed cold. The organs possessed their respective capacities for receiving and expelling, and the flow of vital energy was alternately expansive and contracted.<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a> Your body is frail, having tasted repeatedly bitter medicines for purging, yet still afflicted. You should maintain a correct path and avoid excessive enthusiasm for grand achievements.<br/>
<br/>
Take Gagnopa Powder and Formulate Jian Zhong Tang.<br/>
<br/>
The pulse is taut and strong, like tracing the edge of a knife, with no sign of turbulence or harmony. The excess of dampness is due to a deficiency of gold. You are like a traitor who has been defeated.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a> If it is not to cultivate the spirit of universal harmony, in order to subdue discord, it will inevitably lead to the suppression of yin and the lack of support for yang. When frost hardens the ice, how can it not be wise to anticipate it? Lao Tzu said, “Sharp teeth will break,” surely this is true. Most earnestly, most earnestly, most earnestly. This must be fulfilled by the left seal.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a> Sheng gan cao, bei sha san, liao dou pi, dong sang ye, sheng bai shao, mai dong rou.<br/>
<br/>
Middle earth established by the height of the Kunlun Mountains, fixing the position of eight directions; this is the state of Shu in the earth. The pulse of this region is slow and flowing. Now, the flood (of illness) is excessive, the face yellow and the qi (vital energy) heavy; fortunately, one has resided in Zhejiang for a long time. If one were to be in one’s homeland, the pulse signs would indicate an excess of blood. Upon returning to Shu today, it is advisable to take the Six Flavors of Earth Supplements early to nourish it.<br/>
<br/>
Six Flavors of Earth Supplements.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a> The vital essence, of high rank, resembles the six yangs, next in order the six yins; these are all pure and uncorrupted manifestations. Now, the body draws from the six yangs, this is a preliminary effort. It divides into nine stages, and positions itself in three sections. Though it is one of these sections, it examines all the organs and viscera, yet the left section is most apparent: the heart, liver, and kidneys. Now, the *cun* vein is greatly empty; this is because the heart does not contain spirit; the *guan* pulse is smooth and numerous, indicating that there is no water nourishing the wood; the *chi* pulse rises greatly, indicating imbalance of water.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a> Fire is the body of wood, wood the mother of water, originating from one primal essence, from which arises illumination. Therefore, it is known that in the center of earth, occasional shadows are drawn forth, the vital energy of the heart descends towards the interior; in the center of lake, extraordinary shadows generate yang, the vital energy of the kidneys ascends towards the exterior. This is simply the interaction of the heart and kidneys. The instruction, “Water and fire interacting will never age,” refers to this. It is nothing more than the ordinary daily practice of calming the heart, harmonizing the liver, and strengthening the kidneys.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a> The patient exhibited no dizziness, agitation, or impairment of limb function, and maintained a calm demeanor. I have briefly prescribed a single herbal formula, prioritizing the strengthening of the vital essences and defensive fluids, and the method for nourishing the body. Furthermore, I present the following formula: *Ren Shen* (Panax ginseng), *Za Ren* (Prunus armeniaca seeds), *Yuan Zhi* (Ligusticum chuanxiong), *Dang Gui* (Angelica sinensis), *Zhi Cao* (Agrimonia eupatoria), *Shu Di* (Curcuma longa rhizome), *Fu Shen* (Ophiopogon japonicus), *Yuan Shen* (Panax pseudoginseng), *Bai Shao* (Peony root), *Mu Xiang* (Boscalis wood). The pulse was somewhat calmer than before, with an even distribution of energy in both hands, all reflecting the inherent yang of the body. There was no extraneous energy entering, but the vital essences were somewhat deficient. Notably, the heart yin required nourishment, and the kidney yang required conservation, to provide the necessary mental energy for serving the people’s utmost intentions. Initially, a decoction was prepared and administered daily in a single dose to restore and fortify; subsequently, a paste and pills were prepared and administered sequentially.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a> The spirit of the *Xiantǐ* was already perfected and at ease from that day forward: ginseng, jujube seeds, *guīsēn* (returning-to-the-body herbs), charred mugwort, *fúshén* (fection-of-the-spirit), *yuánshēn* (original ginseng), white peony, locust beans, ripened walnuts, peach kernel.<br/>
<br/>
*The *Internals* state that the three yang conditions constitute the formation of the diaphragm, specifically referring to the Sun, Yangming, and ShaoYang meridians. Now, observing the color of the pulse, both Yin and Jie Yin conditions are also diseased. If filling the lower abdomen is the primary concern, it is undoubtedly appropriate, but how does one cross over without the stomach gate? Furthermore, there is a mass of heat stagnating within, accompanied by wood evil obstructing and elevating the heat in the central region; gaining heat is merely a matter of frenzy.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a> The severity of the cold renders leniency unacceptable; the force of sweetness resists haste. If the lungs cease to generate moisture, and the large intestine ceases to generate fluid, the depletion of moisture will be a great obstacle to recovery. Furthermore, the upward flow indicates a liver disturbance; it dries up the moisture; and the failure to absorb indicates a stomach ailment, hindering the descent of the lung qi. Within the body, true essence and vital fluid are the key. I humbly offer my observations here, yet I do not know how to proceed.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a> Advance five juices for drinking, followed by the administration of medicinal decoctions may also be attempted:<br/>
Bamboo shoot juice, sugarcane juice, liquorice root juice, fresh lotus root juice, and melon juice, each one cupful; ginger juice and agarwood juice, each a small spoonful.<br/>
Having examined the pulse, the only finding was deficiency and thinness with a lack of power, the string-like pulse having receded. The trembling of the limbs was a sign of depleted vital energy. Previously administered medicines had shown little effect, because the vital energy was unable to carry out the instructions of the formula. Now that the vital energy does not recover in one day, the disease mechanism does not abate in one day.<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a> The root of the illness and the vital essence are not equal; the former diminishes while the latter increases, this is the natural order. Based on my humble opinion, medicine should directly address the innate qualities, making pills for the morning and evening, sustaining themselves for a long time. The vital essence and pure spirit return in a single moment; later-stage nourishment should not be forced, nor should it strive to strengthen itself. Therefore, this illness is not caused by sudden external invasion or internal injury, and there is no need to use numerous prescriptions; instead, use bitter yang to invigorate the stomach. Moreover, it is recorded that “those suitable for the stomach are nourishing.”<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a> Long-term simmering of medicinal herbs, if suitable for the stomach, is it correct? I, the humble one, have come at the behest of Jian Gong of Wu-zhong, to examine his complexion and pulse, and it is clear that the matter does not extend beyond this reasoning. I was compelled to remain in Zhentai for three days, partly to witness the esteem of Zhentai’s subordinates, and partly due to the deep affection of Jian Gong, and I wished to gather physicians from the Zhejiang region to prepare a batch of remedies to repay Zhentai. Now, I have examined his symptoms, and will not further disturb him, and I can directly supply him with the necessary medicine. Let us propose three formulas for simmering into pastes and pills, which should be simmered temporarily, the pastes taken regularly, and the pills taken in the morning.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a> Having filled twenty days outside, news arrived. One should still inquire about the examination’s progress (but there is no response). The patient’s body is fundamentally deficient in yin, with both internal and external pathogenic influences manifesting; heat has persisted for more than twenty days without resolution. This is due to the exhaustion of yin fluid, which cannot produce sweat, and the pathogenic influences are also unaddressed.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a> After the use of the Lien Agent to nourish yin, when the evil diminishes, a great sweating ensues, this is the time of the wandering rain and the flourishing of all things, a favorable season; therefore, there is no doubt that the body is weakened. However, those with weak constitutions and long-standing illnesses fail to understand, their vital energy depleted, when the evil slightly manifests, great sweating occurs, this belongs to the category of adjusting and replenishing the foundation, and must not be neglected.  Calm the mind, and the energy will settle, and the spirit will remain; it is imperative not to disturb the spirit and vital energy, causing yang energy to rise.<br/>
<br/>
Prescription: Four *qians* of ginseng, one *liang* of *shú dì*, two *qians* of *bào mù fú shén*, three *qians* of *tiān dòng*, five *qians* of *zhì shǒu wū*, six *qians* of *zuǒ gù mǐ lì*.<br/>
<br/>
The pulse is hollow and string-like, with sudden pain in the abdomen, indicating a liver disorder. This is a good method for treating the liver, and also for the spleen:<br/>
<br/>
One *qians* of coarse cinnamon, half *wen* of *mò yào*, two *qians* of prepared *bái shào* (white peony) fried yellow, one *qians* of *gān cǎo* (glycyrrhiza) fried black, half *qians* of amber, half *yí táng* (honey candy).<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a> Bone small, flesh crisp, not originally the nature of pine trees; supplementing and purging with warm and cool medicines, surely this is a method to benefit life? Fortunately, one can eat solid excrement, allowing autumn to still support it. However, when the moon’s illness breaks the flesh, side sleeping and obstruction of the meridians, the physician still dreams, why? I, an old man, do not speak of medicine, merely record a few words, and prescribe the following: *Shú dì*, *zhì cǎo*, *dāng guī*, *shēng zuǒ mù lí*.<br/>
<br/>
All twelve meridians have coughs, how can the stomach be free from them?<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a> Considering that the sickness resides in the golden organs, the viscera also suffer, and seeking pain and purging from this source, there is no trace to be found. One must focus on the upper solar plexus, and another on the viscera of the lungs. Therefore, it is impossible to discern. The diagram of the roof must be followed, requiring coordinated forces. Then a method was devised, requesting the assistance of all the masters. With this, one can enhance the essence, sometimes like a bundle of straw to be gathered, to provide power for a boat—how is this possible?<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a> One *qian* of ginseng, one *qian* of roasted black licorice, five *qian* of dates, five *qian* of honeyed sugar, one *qian* of cinnamon wood, two *qian* of prepared liquor fried with white peony root, one *qian* of ginger, simmered and made well-cooked; decoct once, remove the dregs, and take it before swallowing.  The illness originates from dampness and heat, with insufficient vital energy to repel external pathogens attacking the middle and lower Jiao.  It is modeled after the use of lohan and black bean paste, separating ginger and *qing* (root) herbs in opposing directions, and utilizing fragrant grasses to dispel the evil.  Whether it has an effect on the skin is unknown: black mountain栀 (lohan), *dan*qing (less bitter root), *chuan*yùjīn (Chuan Yujin), *sheng*xiāngfú (sheng xiang fu), cooked black bean paste, ginger, *xian*shíchāngpú (xian shichangpu), ginger, *sheng*gancao (sheng gancao).<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a> The illness had long disordered the vital energies, ultimately residing within the Jiaoyang (厥阴) organ. Now, the merchant’s assistant used golden energy to subdue it, nourishing essence energy to soothe and comfort it, and true shadow energy to block and restrain it. Also, Ziyou (子贡) preserved the intention to destroy the Wu kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Horn of the mountain antelope, ginseng, prepared *zhoushouwu* (制首乌), clear *ajiang* (阿胶), *módòng* (麦冬), *yúnfúshén* (云茯神).<br/>
<br/>
The patient’s true energy had long been incomplete in the limbs, and was also severely afflicted by heat. He had urine discharge, blurred vision, and a tense pulse ascending to the apex of the hand.

Therefore, Dongguan (Dongguan) formulated a half-summer 麻汤 (ma tang), while Jingyue (景岳) wrote *Left Return* to supplement its deficiencies.

The stomach serves as a vessel for storing phlegm, and therefore, the descending-phlegm soup and the Six Herbage all achieve only minor effects. However, without removing the root of the matter, it is incompatible with the methods of Zhongke; sweet *tinglia* (a medicinal herb), bitter *tinglia*, and dates.

The medical texts state: “Excessive consumption of pungent foods leads to a violent outburst.” Currently, he presents with debility in color, pulse, form, and body. He does not suffer from a violent outburst, nor will he live long. It is advisable to maintain control of his illness. Initially, he should take three herbs to subdue the symptoms: *生地黄* (shendi huang – chuanxiong root), *赤茯苓* (chi buling – red pinellia), *麦冬* (ma dong – snow lotus), *粉甘草* (fen gancao – powdered licorice), *生米仁* (sheng mi ren – raw rice germ), and *红枣* (hong zhao – dried jujubes).

The pulse is taken several times and is also stringy. This is a case of yin deficiency and excess. It is not caused by external factors.

Those whose diets are not harmonious are deficient in Yin. Ge Zhi Chuan’s *Ju Hou Fang* describes a method for treating those with excessive sweating, using the medicine known as “Shen Qu” (God’s Melody). For those deficient in Yin, one uses the Shen Qu powder.  Specifically, six ingredients of True Ginseng, six herbs of Shen Qu, finely ground and stir-fried until fragrant, using two or four portions.<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a> After each meal, administer two *qian* (ounces) dissolved in hot water. The central portion is the place where qi, blood, and body fluids gather; now, the stomach qi cannot circulate within the pulse, this is due to the deficiency of vital essence. Sour is used to retain and expel, pungent to promote flow, and sweet is used to cultivate, which caused the swelling and then discarded it. Proposed formula for review: Tangerine, white bark, *zháo* ai (burning aloe), *xǐng tóu cǎo* (wakeful head grass), *mài dòng* (snow ear moss), *mù guā* (pumpkin), *wǔ wèi zǐ* (five flavors seed).

If mistakenly administered, it will inevitably lead to a path of gradual deficiency and damage, not due to an illness, but due to excessive treatment. One must shift the vital essence of high, bright, and tranquil emptiness, treating it with a period of seventy days, in the hope of obtaining it. A formula to nourish the Yang and benefit the Yin: dried ginger (same as pounded wu mi zi),茯苓 (fu ling), diu gu pi (earth marrow), sang ye (mulberry leaf), sheng lian dou (raw broad bean), and sheng gan cao (raw licorice).<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a> The pulse moves without feeling, representing the vital essence of the stomach, and is called ‘Gong Shao.’ Though not like the *Nan Jing’s* assertion of ‘only a string without a stomach,’ its presence in a long-standing illness is undesirable.

Given its thin constitution, it coughs with red sputum, easily injuring the yin.

Now, the string pulse showed a reduction in its characteristic, the face was slightly sunken and retreated, this medicine was appropriate, yet the patient was excessively thirsty and desired to drink, it remained as before. Therefore, the Yang Ming’s depot was disturbed, the internal filth remained unremoved, the decoction produced phlegm and fluid, the downward flow was not open for one day, and the upward flow continued for one day, rising upwards.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a> Although there are strategies to rectify deficiencies, who would dare to indiscriminately administer them?

　　苏禄国贡使久咳不能卧案：辨八方之风，测五土之性，大率贵邦偏在中华之巽上，箕尾之前，翼轸之外，阳气偏泄，即有风寒，易感易散。来此华夏，已属三焦。况不得卧下，肺气大伤，止宜润降而已：蜜炙枇杷叶、麦冬、川贝、甜杏仁、经霜桑叶、米仁。　　《内经》谓：骨肉柔脆之人，其质本弱。然以脉症较之，其咳原属手太阴得之。<a id="orig-2p" href="#trans-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br/>
闻先一人补之，后一人泻之，邪则从补而升，元则由泻而虚，竟成庙兵出而岸兵入也。亦参末议，共博一笑：　　北沙参、燕窝、桑叶、冰糖、川贝母、紫菀。　　少腹有形隆起如阜，上至心下则厥逆。来疾去驶，虽大力人拒之不能却。上则人身为之上窜，下则人身为之下坠，不能强挣。<a id="orig-3p" href="#trans-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br/>
一翕一辟，一上一下，乃至人身上下如舂杵。口鼻两阴之血，随其上下溢出，群医不能治。余思此症载在《难经》，特未曾缕晰示人耳。且云：&quot;此物伏在脐旁上下则少楚，伏入脐中则少安。&quot;可见脐旁两穴，亦与此条相合，且弗揭明其义，一任群公思而得之可也。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br/>
　　用薄荷汤送下神秘丸。以病人自思此汤饮之，其物倏伏而不动，故亦用之。　　素来扰亏根本，不特病者自嫌，即操医师之术者，亦跋前疐后之时也。值风木适旺之令，病目且黄，已而遗精淋浊。少间，则又膝胫肿痛不能行。<a id="orig-5p" href="#trans-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br/>
及来诊时，脉象左弦数，右搏而长，面沉紫而时时作呕。静思其故，从前纷纷之病，同一邪也，均为三病，次第缠绵耳。由上而下，由下而至极下，因根本久拨之体，复蒸而上为胃病，是肾胃相关之故也。倘不稍为戢除一二，但取回阳返本，窃恐剑关苦拒，而阴平非复汉有也。谨拟一法，略效丹溪，未识何如：　　羚羊角、木瓜、酒炒黄柏、伏龙肝、生米仁、橘红、马料豆。<a id="orig-6p" href="#trans-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br/>
　　疬劳得愈，如麟毛兔角。或叩之琼台丹扃间，求金光一叶，庶几悦然：　　小建中汤。　　脉象右三部洪数弦急并现，左上数中紧。先患阳精不升，次及于阳络不固。盖至阴生阳，不屯失精为先天，至阳出阴，失蒙吐红为后天。<a id="orig-7p" href="#trans-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br/>
是有形始兆之后，复现先后天俱病。即察至真有余之躯，亦不足以供其渐耗。今将投味厚入阴者乎?抑投味薄清阳者耶?窃恐山川草木，皆不足以还返金品。<a id="orig-8p" href="#trans-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br/>
莫夫大药金丹，周天火候耳。然又不可不以服食之方佐之，拟候尊师同订，终惭布鼓。希谅之：　　建莲肉一斤(带心扑如麻子大，饭上蒸、晒九次为末)，麦冬肉一斤，嫩荷叶半斤，顶生地四两，金樱子半斤(去毛)。　　以上四味熬膏，同莲肉粉杵为丸几，秋石汤送五钱。　　抑郁顿挫，侘傺无聊，心乃偏倚，十二官皆无主，则阴气并于阳也。<a id="orig-9p" href="#trans-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br/>
投以重镇之剂：　　生铁落、郁金、半夏、苦参、橘红、茯苓。　　阳极升而不入，阴郁沉而不附，是以有昼无夜，离明当午而睡，水渐衰矣。治以交阴阳，引卫入营。毋云血家忌半夏也：　　半夏、酸枣仁、生地、生甘草、糯米、茯苓、米仁、去油乳香。　　暑热时邪，病经二十日。<a id="orig-10p" href="#trans-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br/>
诸法具备，何必问途于蹇足，既承触暑相招，勉尔挥汗撰方：　　川连、半夏、生甘草、淡芩、茯苓、生姜。　　此症原属胃乏冲和之气而起。要之冲和之气，即太和元气。位天地，育万物，无非此气。少有不足，已非所宜，况大有所损乎?<a id="orig-11p" href="#trans-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br/>
拙见宜谢绝一切，高养山斋，饵以药石，廓然世外，庶几霍然。若在操觚莲幕，非所宜也。吾闻君子赠人以言，爱人以德，故琐屑及此：　　旋覆花、木瓜、生谷芽、炙草、代赫石、白芍、糯米汁。　　病更节后，医历多人，朝张言热，暮李论寒。脏腑各有受盛，运气各有翕辟。<a id="orig-12p" href="#trans-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br/>
渺尔一躯，遍尝补泻，不病亦病矣。宜守正持法，幸勿好大喜功：　　当归建中汤。　　脉弦劲如循刀刃，全无冲和之气。水气太过，金令不及。从后来者，谓之贼克。<a id="orig-13p" href="#trans-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br/>
苟非致太和之气，以消乖戾，必至阴失潜藏，阳无所倚。履霜坚冰至，岂可不未雨而绸缪乎?老子云：&quot;齿刚则折&quot;，殆其是也。切嘱切嘱。此方存之，期于左券。<a id="orig-14p" href="#trans-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br/>
　　炙甘草、北沙参、料豆皮、冬桑叶、生白芍、麦冬肉。　　中土以嵩高而定八方之位，是蜀在坤矣。毓斯境者，脉宜缓而流利。今洪搏太过，面黄气重，幸在浙已久，若处故乡，是脉象当血溢。即日回蜀，宜早服丸以滋之：　　六味地黄丸。<a id="orig-15p" href="#trans-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br/>
　　清贵之脉，类多六阳，次则六阴，是皆纯淳之象。今体禀六阳，是一征也。息分九候，位分三部。虽一部之中，均察脏腑，而左部显然者，心肝肾三脏。今寸来空大，是心不藏神也；关脉滑数，木无水养也；尺来浮大，水气不衡也。<a id="orig-16p" href="#trans-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br/>
火以木为体，木以水为母，先天一气，由是通明。故知离中偶画生阴，心气日欲下交；坎中奇画生阳，肾气日欲上承。是即心肾一交也。丹诀云：&quot;水火相交永不老&quot;者，此也。无非寻常日用之间，心欲宁，肝欲和，肾欲实。<a id="orig-17p" href="#trans-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br/>
庶无恍惚悸动以及肢末不利，而四体泰然矣。谨疏一方，先滋营卫，颐养之法，再图疏呈：　　人参、枣仁、远志、当归、炙草、熟地、茯神、元参、白芍、木香。　　脉象较前稍和，两手平均，俱就六阳本体，可卜无外来之气，惟营卫少虚耳。但观簿书旁午，是心阴不得不养，肾阳不得不藏，以供日用之精神，以副临民之至意。先配汤药，带往省中，日进一剂培补；随配膏丸相继。<a id="orig-18p" href="#trans-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br/>
宪体精神，自当日臻康泰矣：　　人参、枣仁、归身、炙草、茯神、元参、白芍、杞子、熟胡桃、桂圆肉。　　《内经》称三阳结乃成膈者，单指太阳、阳明、少阳也。今从脉色较之，少阴与厥阴亦病。若以填补下焦为首务，固所当然，但胃关一部，从何飞渡?且有一团郁火，挟木邪横亢于中州，得热为伍，愈肆猖狂。<a id="orig-19p" href="#trans-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br/>
苦寒势所不容，甘寒势不容缓。倘令肺不生津，大肠不生液，津液愈亏，为病愈繁矣。且逆上者，肝邪也，水不生之耳；不纳者，胃病也，肺气不降耳。一身之中，津液真精，皆为切要。愚见专事于此，未识如何?<a id="orig-20p" href="#trans-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br/>
先进五汁饮，次商投药可也：　　芦根汁、甘蔗汁、茅根汁、鲜藕汁、水梨汁各一杯，生姜汁、沉香汁各一小匙。　　诊得脉象，惟有虚细无力，弦象俱退。手足颤振，此元气亏弱之征。前此投药，俱无少效者，盖为元气不克载药行令耳。今元气一日不复，则病机一日不退。<a id="orig-21p" href="#trans-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br/>
病机与元气本不并峙，此长彼消，理之常也。据愚见，汤药在乎其次，必以直走先天之品剂为膏丸，朝斯夕斯，久久自足。元气元精，一朝而复，后天饮食，不强自强矣。因此症非暴感内伤，不必数更方，以苦阳明胃口。且经不云乎&quot;适于胃者为补&quot;。<a id="orig-22p" href="#trans-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br/>
煎药久服，适于胃者否耶？愚自吴中承给谏公之命，来斯一诊色脉，固知不出此理。勉为镇台留三日者，一则感镇台下士之隆，一则为给谏公笃亲之爱，而欲浙中诸医，一批隙导窾，以报镇台。今参脉症，毋事更张，直补先天可也。议呈煎膏丸三方。煎则暂用，膏则时时频服，丸则清晨为定。<a id="orig-23p" href="#trans-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br/>
俟填补二十日外，便有消息。尚当叩阶复诊如何?(方未见。)　　尊体本阴虚，阳气并邪独发，热廿余日不解。盖阴液枯，不能作汗，邪亦不解也。<a id="orig-24p" href="#trans-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br/>
连剂养阴之后，邪少松则大汗泄，是云行雨施，品物咸亨之候，何疑其脱耶？但弱体久病不解，元气愈亏，此邪稍出，大汗作，亦属接补关头，不容少懈耳。心静，则气定而神住，切不可忧扰神气，致阳气上升。至嘱至嘱：　　人参四钱，熟地一两，抱木茯神二钱，天冬三钱，制首乌五钱，左顾牡蛎六钱。　　脉空弦，腹中急痛，肝病也。治肝不应，治脾亦良法也：　　粗桂枝一钱，没药五分，白芍二钱炒黄，甘草一钱炒黑，琥珀一钱，饴糖钱半。<a id="orig-25p" href="#trans-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br/>
　　骨小肉脆，本非松柏之质；补泻温凉杂投，岂是济生之术?幸能食便实，秋令尚可扶持。然破（月困）脱肉，侧眠经阻，医者犹然梦梦，何也?仆老不谈医，聊书数语，并拟一方：　　熟地、炙草、当归、生左牡蛎。　　十二经皆有咳，胃病安得不咳?<a id="orig-26p" href="#trans-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br/>
况此土病于金脏，而腑亦病，于此而求其痛与泻，一在于胃之上脘，一在于肺之腑，所以无从踪迹也。仰屋图维，必须分兵合剿。乃得拟一法，请诸道长。以此而益精之，或当刍荛可采，为虾力于行舟何如：　　江西赤石脂六两(缎)，炒黑干姜一两。二味为末，黄米饭为丸。<a id="orig-27p" href="#trans-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br/>
　　人参一钱，炙黑甘草一钱，大枣五钱，饴糖五钱，桂木一钱，酒炒白芍二钱，煨熟生姜一钱。水煎一次，去渣，送服前桃花丸三钱。　　病本湿温，元气不能载邪外出，有直犯中焦之势矣。拟栀、豉上下分开之，姜、芩左右升降之，芳香之草横解之，以冀廓清诸邪。未识得奏肤功否：　　黑山栀、淡芩、川郁金、生香附、炒香豉、生姜、鲜石菖蒲、生甘草。<a id="orig-28p" href="#trans-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br/>
　　病久绪紊，终不离乎厥阴一脏。今商佐金气以暗制之，营滋气以抚绥之，实太阴以堵御之。亦子贡存鲁，霸越灭吴之意：　　羚羊角、人参、制首乌、清阿胶、麦冬、云茯神。　　诊得真气久不周于四肢，又暴受暑邪类中，遗溺目瞑，脉弦数而上承鱼际。肝风为足厥阴，暑风为手厥阴，手足两经得病，瘖而不能言者不治。<a id="orig-29p" href="#trans-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br/>
且移至近地凉处为病室，外解暑邪，内用对证之药以救其逆：　　羚羊角、竹茹、连翘仁、鲜桑枝、半夏、鲜石菖蒲根。　　人生五十，一脏衰，况向六乎？所患聚讼者，皆主肾脏。盖以所述，大旨在扼定脾此，则枢机得，而四运成矣：　　独术膏，先用十斤可也。　　真气已漓，病何能愈?有愈之方者，其仙乎：　　归芍六君去甘草，鲜桑枝煎汤代水。<a id="orig-30p" href="#trans-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br/>
　　此太阴被湿气熏蒸，无清肃之权，木无畏，右肩臂渐显不仁之象。曲蘖伤生，而尚甘之，我不解也：　　生米仁、鲜芦核、生地、嫩桑枝、白归身、赤芍。　　人身之脉，胸走手，腹走足，八十丈周于一身。未有沉寒筋之损而不及于下者，先后异时，为患则一。非鲍姑之艾，文伯之针不能愈。<a id="orig-31p" href="#trans-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br/>
内服八味汤可也：　　桂附八味丸。　　佞布之人多嗜，积郁之人多火。久而久之，佛郁之性，飙发波掀，若狂若魅。药石既不能与，先与丹药焚于室中，以辟易其狂悖可也：　　如意丹七丸。　　须眉自落，皮毛淖泽，脉来浮涩，此风也，非衰白也。<a id="orig-32p" href="#trans-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br/>
三十六种，同出异名，非浅可之疾。夏月宜食香风蛇(即俗名黑风蛇也)，与鸡煮食之：　　白归身、白麻、赤芍、生地、早莲草、僵蚕、银花、茺蔚子、夏枯草。　　头痛，窅不见人为一忌；肝风，呕吐胆汁为一忌。相与有年，知已惟此一人，岂宜坐视。务得挽回为妙，然国有数存焉者矣：　　沮胆汤去枳实，加天麻、钩藤、桑叶。<a id="orig-33p" href="#trans-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br/>
　　是证究属肝风，则厥阴一经，未易制也。在古法：有镇摄一法，有培土御之一法。所以东垣有半夏天麻汤，而景岳又撰左归以补其阙略。今二法皆不能纯用之矣，拟出入一方备采：　　人参、焦术、茯苓、柏子仁、半夏、陈皮、熟地、白归身、炙草、鳖甲。　　久咳移邪犯胃，因咳而肺肃无权，故气升逆。<a id="orig-34p" href="#trans-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br/>
勿用泻损肺气之药：　　水梨去心带皮捣烂，丝绵滤清，慢火熬成膏，收入磁瓶内，蜡封口。每日开水送五钱。　　阳明脉实，气急而喘，壮火食气，消烁真阴。夏气开张而剧，剥枣时坦境也。此刻不能他图，姑与温胆汤，少衰其热，以保伤金。<a id="orig-35p" href="#trans-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br/>

胃热炽矣。况前服之药，皆辛温耗阴之品，今非寒凉不可。然宜小心保护为主，因热邪深入阴中，而阳气独亢耳：　　川黄连、枳实、瓜蒌、赤芍、生甘草、陈皮、杏仁、木通。　　病之原，由食柿过多，得寒而起。于兹二十余年矣。<a id="orig-37p" href="#trans-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br/>
要知柿为西方之木，其实禀秋金之气而成，其与肺金同气相求，可知其邪入肺，发为气哮，久则肾水无本，虚而上泛为痰。胃为贮痰之器，所以降气汤、六君子，由肺及胃，皆得小效。而不除要莒，与即墨不拔，齐地终非燕有，况脉象尚悍，当深入病所为是。拟仲景方法：　　甜葶苈，苦葶苈、大枣。　　嗽而失血，已逾三载，缠绵不已，色黯脉弦，嗽益甚，环口色黄。<a id="orig-38p" href="#trans-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br/>
由于肝脾，及于肾，上藏为其所取，给而不能应矣。饮亦从而为患，逐之不得，滋之无功，迁延日损，莫可弥缝。当取其中以冀流布，庶几近之。拟宗建中法，加以涤饮之品，俟阳明升而继以大补太阴，然后渐入纯阴之法，否则非治也：　　小建中汤去姜，加茯苓、姜皮。　　古人造字，两火着力为劳，故为君相二火而说。<a id="orig-39p" href="#trans-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br/>
温补中州，以静痰之源，补下焦以益水之源。但病势已深，恐非一击可破也：　　熟地、枸杞子、元参、牛膝、茯苓、紫石英。　　横则为三坎，竖则为川水，中间一点真阳，水亏则露，为龙火，□为震，震下之阳，与之同源，升为雷火，所以雷为木属，皆阴中之火也。纯阴之药，愈泼愈炽，一切草木，无能制之。当用一元丹，久服愈矣：　　澹秋石五六觔（斤之异体字），红枣浆为丸。<a id="orig-40p" href="#trans-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br/>
早服五六钱，晚服二三钱，以阳秋石少许点汤送下。　　脉弦数，尺独大，咳而喉痛失音。乃数载失红之后，其阴亏火炎，不言可喻矣。唯有至静之品，引阳潜入阴中，庶近《内经》之旨。然须作静摄工夫，使阴秘阳密，得坎离相交之力为妙：　　熟地、海石粉（捣烂）、金石斛、北沙参、茯苓、麦门冬、生白芍、龟腹板、山药。<a id="orig-41p" href="#trans-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br/>
　　形忽渐瘦，脉虚极，气怯偶咳，目黑脉弦，忽忽不乐。补气补血，人所知也，宜将阴兽，引入阴中，药犹得力。早晚捕獭一头，取肝阴干，用鹿角胶，各于木器杵碎。早服鹿角胶末一钱，晚服獭肝末一钱，皆开水送下。此常用百日之法，今拟煎方先服：　　人参、茯苓、菟丝饼、南枣、焦冬术、炙草、枸杞子。<a id="orig-42p" href="#trans-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br/>
　　左关搏指急疾，右关弦大。无胃气不归元，充海无根。右关如是，当剧于春；左关如是，当折于秋。恐左关为应，勉拟古人乙癸同源之治：　　大生地、女贞子、枸杞子、茯神、元参、怀山药、紫石英。　　此病起于费心劳碌，风寒不节，遂至咳嗽吐痰，久则内伤。<a id="orig-43p" href="#trans-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br/>
内伤者，内中脏气伤也，即古人所谓虚劳证，总不得愈。必须绝去费心劳碌之事，一毫凡念不起，助之以药，或可延年：　　麦冬、阿胶、桔梗、炙草、沙参、米仁、茯苓。　　此痧劳也。由于太阴伤损，日传至足少阴。脾气少溏，则入下藏也。<a id="orig-44p" href="#trans-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br/>
百无一治，速宜返棹，闭关静养。方一首奉赠，日饮可也：　　熟地、阿胶、百合、枸杞子。　　花甲之人，两尺独大。二藏已衰之际，岂宜如此?急进已癸同源之法可矣：　　熟地、女贞子、菟丝饼、茯苓、元参、早莲草、枸杞子。<a id="orig-45p" href="#trans-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br/>
蜜丸。　　此真阴亏证，俗名百日劳也。稍有伏暑，所以寒热愈甚。惜乎治之不早耳：　　熟地、茜草、青篙、元参、滑石、丹皮。　　坎中一画，真阳孤飞于上，一交已午之月，神水金丹，亦奈之何：　　老生姜、天冬、怀牛膝、甘草、川石斛、元参、女贞子。<a id="orig-46p" href="#trans-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br/>
　　禀性好食辛，医书云：&quot;多食辛，令暴卒。&quot;今诊得色脉形骸俱惫，不须暴卒，亦不长生。自宜持其病。令先服三生欲：　　生地黄、赤茯苓、麦冬、粉甘草、生米仁、红枣。　　此一损证也。<a id="orig-47p" href="#trans-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br/>

清·薛雪生 White’s Edition, 清·Wu Jinshou’s Phonetic Revision<br/>
<br/>
The bones are small, the flesh brittle; certainly not the appearance of pine or cypress. The pulse is numerous and then ceases, already revealing the signs of exhaustion. Weakness from birth combined with a deficiency of fluids, followed by vigorous heat and dryness of metal. The annual environment causes a continuous depletion; how can it be allowed to continue? The autumn wind’s sudden introduction has already caused injury, and it is unavoidable. The symptoms are as described above; the medicine is solely to nourish the north, not to claim it is a dream, merely to alleviate the vexation: *生地* (shanbei), *沙参* (shasan), *地骨皮* (tieli gupi), *麦冬* (ma dong), *金石斛* (jinshuhuo), *生鳖甲* (sheng bietjia).<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">The emissary of Suluk, having long coughed and been unable to lie down, discerned the eight winds and measured the nature of the five lands. His disposition, generally, favored the巽 (east-south) direction, ahead of the箕 (spoon) tail, beyond the 翼 (wing) and轸 (wheel), with excessive yang energy that readily leaked out; even a slight wind chill easily weakened and dispersed him. Upon arriving in the Hua Xia (China), he already belonged to the three yang meridians. Moreover, since he could not lie down, his lung qi was severely injured, and the only appropriate treatment was to moisten and descend it: honey-baked枇杷 (loquat) leaves, 麦冬 (snow lotus), 川贝 (Chinese magnolia bark), sweet杏仁 (apricot kernel), frost-stricken 桑 (mulberry) leaves, and 米仁 (rice kernel).<br/>

《内经》 states that those with bones and flesh that are soft and brittle possess a fundamentally weak constitution. However, considering the pulse diagnosis, his cough originated from the hand’s 太阴 (yin) energy.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></div>

The blood from the mouth and nostrils, overflowing upwards and downwards, could not be treated by all physicians. I thought this illness was recorded in the *Nan Jing*, and therefore have not clarified it for the people. Furthermore, it is said: “This object, when lodged near the navel, upwards and downwards, causes little discomfort; when it enters the navel, it causes little peace.” Thus, the two points near the navel are also in accordance with this statement, and it is sufficient that it be left for the public to think about and discover it themselves.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Upon examination, the pulse was weak and irregular on the left, strong and prolonged on the right, the face was deeply purple and frequently vomited. After carefully considering the cause, previous recurrent illnesses, all stemmed from a single pathogenic factor, manifesting as three distinct diseases progressing in a protracted manner. From above downwards, and from below upwards to the most extreme, due to a fundamental constitution long disturbed, it manifested as a disease of the stomach, a consequence of the relatedness of the kidneys and stomach. Should it not be gently relieved and corrected by removing a few of the symptoms, and returning the yang to its root, I fear it would be like the suffering at the Sword Gate, and there would be no restoration like that of the Han Dynasty.

The pulse was three parts on the right, a rapid, string-like sound, with a concurrent swelling; on the left, a count upwards from the middle, firm. Previously, the deficiency was in Yang Jing (essence) not rising; subsequently, it affected the Yang Luo (channels) not being fixed. It is because the Yin generates Yang, and there is a loss of Jing, that this is congenital; when Yang emerges from Yin, and there is a fever with red tongue, this is acquired.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a></div>
