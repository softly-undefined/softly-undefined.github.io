      <div>One obtains clarity of mind through Chan practice (by a Buddhist monk).<br/>
<br/>
Narrative:<br/>
<br/>
During the Tang Dynasty, there was a scroll of remedies for illnesses from the Western Regions. A Taoist immortal obtained it and transmitted it to the *Yìwén Zhì* (Records of Arts and Literature).  A song called “Little Pome Island Ballad” said, “After refining gold pills to the extent of a grain, they were unbearable to share with the public.” When a traveler to the Western Regions brought it, he explained that this was it. Indeed, the Taoists’ dragons, tigers, lead, and mercury were merely empty talk. The Jin柏真人 (Jīn Bǎi Zhēn Ren – Jin Bai Zhen Ren, the Jin Bao真人) with his great elixir, ordered Zhang Lao to go out and sell it.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, who ascended to heaven on a clear day is unknown; it is far better than the prescriptions of kings and nobles.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a><br/>
To save people from suffering is a compassionate heart. It is not to be faulted. The Zen master Yin secluded himself in a Buddhist tower, yet was adept at medicine. His arguments regarding medicine were all penetrating to the core, not comparable to the meticulous study of the *Canon of Hippocrates*, nor could they be expressed in a single word. He drew upon materials found scattered about. He particularly displayed ingenuity and creativity, unconstrained by rigid rules. The monk had broken three ribs on this path. In the early summer of the year of the Tiger, I resided at the Right Temple Celestial Inn.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a><br/>
A monk encountered a visitor and presented this scroll, requesting an inscription. Though I do not know medicine, I knew that monks were skilled in it. I wrote a few words upon the scroll, intending it to reach Zhang Peng (also known as Gong), a man hidden outside the city. Do not seek him among those who hang their heads in the marketplace. Mr. Qu Yuanju of Curvature Residence.<br/>
<br/>
Narrative: Medicine, though small in its path, is the same as benefiting the world and doing good. Did the ancients deceive us? A monk lived in Hangzhou many years ago, and I had a strange illness in Hangzhou, and…<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a><br/>
He lived through many precarious situations. The medical cases were selected from those most remarkable. Only ten of them were recorded. I was particularly fond of medical texts, and I studied the secret writings of the Han, Wei, Six Dynasties, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and the early years of the country without exception. <br/>
<br/>
I poured my energy and spirit into it. I compiled the most essential selections, arranging them into volumes. I constantly reviewed them with myself, meticulously copying them, as if they were treasures of a family. Yet, my tongue would still tremble, and I would feel my spirit unravel.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br/>
Headmaster is the Way. Sincerity is commendable. There is to be a journey to the Upper Seas. One’s sleeves are drawn out, consulting the medical casebook. One asks for an order from me. I employ inner meditation. Having a deep foundation in the root and axis of learning, I am yet able, at the moment of encountering a case, to harmonize with the ancients. I do not readily write. This is truly eating from the ancients and transforming it. Those who are overly rigid in adhering to ancient methods are not particularly commendable. From this, the gains are profound.<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a><br/>
The achievements advanced continuously. Day by day, month by month, they flourished. Accumulated into a vast compilation. One day, he returned, bringing with him the treasures of the South Sea. He burned incense and offered prayers to the Buddha.<br/>
<br/>
The Arhat would invariably stand aside, gesturing with a flower and offering a smile. The Great Sage benefited the world, with a compassionate heart. Like this, like this.<br/>
<br/>
Presented by a Jinshi graduate, a scholar of the Hanlin Academy, a Doctor of Literature, Li Pengfei.<br/>
<br/>
Narrative.<br/>
<br/>
We, in our study of the writings of ancients, are able to unlock the profound wisdom contained within. We do not cling to outdated methods. We establish our own distinct school of thought.  Who claims that the ancients and the present are not connected?  Why should medicine and the way be exempt?<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a><br/>
A monk’s meditations and Zen teachings gathered numerous ancient cases of medical practice by eminent figures. Copies were made in no less than hundreds of volumes. The endings were all embellished with commentaries. It was a lively gathering. The calligraphy was precise and pure. Truly admirable. You, regarding this matter, do not know when you will fully understand it; yet it can be said you are diligent and devoted. You reside in Hangzhou, and over the years, gentlemen of the upper classes have repeatedly sought you out, bringing gold and silk.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a><br/>
I speak to you every time you are outside. Since you are now abroad, what is this about? You say I have three great matters and wishes that remain unresolved. The burial of the deceased has not been arranged, and the heir has not yet been determined. Our family is impoverished and cannot afford weddings and funerals; there are those who need assistance who have not been given it. I heard you say, “This is the natural disposition of human beings; it is beneficial to both parties.” This refers to the foundation of learning; it can be done even when far away.<a id="trans-8p" href="#orig-8p" class="marker">[8p]</a><br/>
I am deeply ashamed and regretful. And you, sir, are determined to achieve success. I observed your meticulous evaluation of each school, though the cold was bitter and the snow fell heavily, I gripped my brush and wrote, unwearied until the fourth watch. Hundreds of people were united in earnest effort, a single heart’s blood poured forth, spirits seemed to converse, words sounded as if heard from the afterlife. The objects upon your desk – the embryonic Xu, the gourd of Xue, the celestial words of Ye Tian Shi, the eloquent pronouncements of Yu Jia Yan, and the venerable Lu Yangu and his grandson – all testified to this.<a id="trans-9p" href="#orig-9p" class="marker">[9p]</a><br/>
And the father and son by the river. A compilation of renowned physicians, continued by Wei Yu Heng. Extracting the essence, removing the dross. Completing the work, supplementing what was lacking. Truly the嫡传 of Huang Qi (Yellow Sage), and the secrets of Qing Nang. Gong Yu’s cases were addressed, the case notes intensely concentrated. He was about to return to his boat. Please arrange for him to be guided by Buddhist roots and Confucian learning, immersed in Buddhist enlightenment.<a id="trans-10p" href="#orig-10p" class="marker">[10p]</a><br/>
The meticulousness of those who visit [this place] is like this. Can there be anything in the world without a root? And yet we can speak of the Way. He intends to meditate and return to the mountain. There are those with great strength. How can one repair and engrave the foundations? There must be those with large eyes who understand that their achievements come from the past. And then, to reap results in the present. He will again be like the meditation. Today’s assessment of ancients is an assessment of meditation. Meditation is very wealthy in years, and its name is very renowned. It has methods for longevity.<a id="trans-11p" href="#orig-11p" class="marker">[11p]</a><br/>
The gods calculate. The profound truth is ingenious. From this, one must contemplate the transmission of the South Sea Lamp. Who else could continue it? Its essence is already advancing in those who will. This is precisely because it is its origin, isn’t it? Strive with your mind! I shall wait and see with clear eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Dated the sixteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Guangxu, in the first month of the year of the Tiger, written by Xu Yilin at the Shiquanfu Pavilion of the Qian Tangqing Temple.<br/>
<br/>
A self-account.<br/>
<br/>
The *Liezi* records that physicians do not change for three generations. They do not accept their medicine. Some say, “It has been passed down through three generations, and its efficacy has become evident over time.” Others say, “…”<a id="trans-12p" href="#orig-12p" class="marker">[12p]</a><br/>
The Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Medicine. Read it completely. I humbly offer my opinion that it is not difficult. Examining the three generations, there must have been prior preparation. Why? The universe is vast, and the medical arts are widespread, with reputations filling all major cities. The boundaries are clearly defined. It focuses on the fundamental principles, without requiring any understanding.<a id="trans-13p" href="#orig-13p" class="marker">[13p]</a><br/>
The lower levels will become clear. Discussion of the diagnosis and prescriptions; all conform to the ancients. Is this not due to prior cause? The mind is deficient in understanding and learning; long enjoyed reading the *Nei Jing*, *Nan Jing*, *Shang Han Lun*, *Jin Kui*, *Qian Jin*, and *Wai Tai*. The works of the great men of Han, Wei, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and the early Qin.  I consumed their teachings. I wore fur and silk, and opened and closed my doors, seeking to enter the world, but had no time for it. I acquired jade boards and jade boxes. I sought out good teachers, and they increased.<a id="trans-14p" href="#orig-14p" class="marker">[14p]</a><br/>
The method is rigorously pursued. I was instructed in acupuncture by Mr. Li Mengzhou. He taught me the methods of mending and exhausting, the techniques of the meeting, the following, the retaining of qi, and all related practices. These were consistent with the *Lingshu* and *Lingyijing* classics. I examined thoroughly and practiced diligently, with slight advancements gleaned from recent knowledge. The learned understood and continued this method as the “Extended Physician,” and with a single gesture, great results were achieved. The world mocks my adherence to the ancients, and those who seek to distort and innovate the ancient methods are entirely dismissed.<a id="trans-15p" href="#orig-15p" class="marker">[15p]</a><br/>
I trust only in the absence of written records. Those who cite ancient precedents to criticize me are mistaken. I am not perceptive. I constantly strive to surpass the ancients, using ink as if it were a rope, and worry about exceeding their boundaries. I display ostentatious displays of skill and dare not do so. I am accused and dare not respond. Alas. With no family secrets to guide me, and even the writings of the Yellow Emperor, three generations past, cannot be fully revealed. To probe the marrow, relying on such fleeting trends.<a id="trans-16p" href="#orig-16p" class="marker">[16p]</a><br/>
Gathering indigo, extracting brilliance. Burning wax, following the level of the sun. Finding joy in this did not tire. Through meditation, one’s efforts were fully filled with compassion. Packing up and leaving the mountains. From tranquility to Hangzhou. A fleeting three years. Empty fame, drifting away. Inviting crowds to follow, a throng arrived. Accumulated manuscripts formed a book. Like scabs, they were removed. The gentlemen’s excessive rewards. Instructing and caring for my hands and people. The foolishness of the two seals.<a id="trans-17p" href="#orig-17p" class="marker">[17p]</a><br/>
He came with a question. He accused me of my faults. He did not understand. It was the sixth month of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, on a day of washing clothes for three days, and he wrote his meditations on the Purple Yang Mountain in the Tiger Forest lodging.<br/>

Volume One, All the Discourses:<br/>
<br/>
A Discussion and Correction of the Misinterpretation of Doctor Xu Hui Regarding the Absence of Fault in Treating Patients;<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the rumor that Doctor Xu Lingtai was a negligent physician who killed people without guilt, I responded saying: What is he asking about the excellence of the contemporary physicians? It is merely a matter of having faults or merits. Just as a person may unexpectedly fall ill and seek a physician, with the household filled with anxiety, like a drought hoping for rain, the gods bestowed their favor.<a id="trans-18p" href="#orig-18p" class="marker">[18p]</a><br/>
The teacher attended to him. He briefly achieved recognition. Gold and silk were given as recompense. Should he stumble, his life and fate are at stake. Who can blame him? Skilled physicians cause widespread evil. Such sins can be revealed. The guest requests a detailed explanation. I say, there are skilled physicians who are deceitful, catering to the master’s wishes, devising countless schemes to please him, appropriate remedies are offered, and inappropriate remedies are prescribed.<a id="trans-19p" href="#orig-19p" class="marker">[19p]</a><br/>
It should be warm and cool. Each time seizing the opportunity to promote its advantages. How could there be fault in this? Some are born, some die. There are physicians who are skilled yet reckless. After finishing the examination, they immediately demand that the previous physician’s prescribed formula be followed, regardless of whether it is correct or not. They invariably prescribe icy and charcoal treatments, exaggerating their own abilities and diminishing the merits of others. The illness may be unforeseen, and they claim it was due to an incorrect dosage of a particular medicine. There are also physicians who are competent but slow to understand.<a id="trans-20p" href="#orig-20p" class="marker">[20p]</a><br/>
To be stubborn is to understand the channels. A settled state is hard to restore. He did not know that illnesses arose from a hundred sources. In the morning, it is appropriate to use warm tonics to nourish. In the evening, it is appropriate to use cool remedies to dispel heat. Some people’s constitutions are inherently cold; their illnesses require a continued use of *qín* and *lián*. Those with inherently hot constitutions require a continued use of *guì* and *fù*. If one is firmly set in their opinions, there is one correct medicine. There are no two divergent diagnoses. When encountering such morning and evening variations in symptoms, and those that contradict the fundamental state of the illness,<a id="trans-21p" href="#orig-21p" class="marker">[21p]</a><br/>
Its misfortune can be established and awaited. There are those who are mediocre and vulgar. Harmony and equality exist without a master. People’s opinions are all the same. The diagnosis is neither refined nor discerning. The nature of the medicine is not yet well-understood. A single flavor is followed according to the patient’s voice, and independent consultation is refused. The patient rejoices greatly at the ease and simplicity of the treatment. The prescriptions are commonplace. They are widely recommended. The wives and daughters are well-known. They claim that throughout their lives they have not been subjected to blame or censure. Its founding intention can still be questioned.<a id="trans-22p" href="#orig-22p" class="marker">[22p]</a><br/>
There were those of peculiar habits. They used herbs, invariably claiming descent from the Wu Men family of celestial scholars. They did not adhere to the Shen Nong Ben Cao, yet Li Shizhen’s Gang Mu was consulted. They scarcely considered it a comprehensive work. They merely picked up items of daily use, claiming them to be wondrous, but they did not address the symptoms of illness; the harm was profound. This was because they were simple-minded and relied on the pronouncements of those of higher status. Some of the superficially knowledgeable would habitually use prescriptions.<a id="trans-23p" href="#orig-23p" class="marker">[23p]</a><br/>
Only a dozen or so grades were involved. There were a few people who were not laughed at. They would invariably invoke the lineage of Xue Li Zhai, the eminent physician. Their prescriptions invariably produced an effect, never failing to strengthen the vital energy. Xiao Yang San. Gui Pi Tang three formulas. It was understood that Xue Li Zhai possessed divine abilities here. Later generations still regarded him as crude and lacking knowledge. Considering the vast difference between him and Xue Li Zhai, it is hardly comparable to Dong Xi’s ineffective imitation. This is simply a case of a mediocre person losing his way through bias. There were some local scholars close to the area, possessing a certain degree of intelligence. They glanced briefly at the medical texts, and had no intention of pursuing medicine.<a id="trans-24p" href="#orig-24p" class="marker">[24p]</a><br/>
The public remained unaware. Because of his superior understanding of principles and reason. He sharpened his arguments. The master summoned Yi Fang to consult him, urging him to carefully consider the matter. Yi Fang then secretly altered the medicine. Success brought credit; failure brought blame. What would the physician then do with his skills? This is the case of those who seek cleverness through diligence. Some arrive from distant lands, falsely claiming expertise in acupuncture and surgery, boasting of their skills. Ultimately, they possess no genuine talent.<a id="trans-25p" href="#orig-25p" class="marker">[25p]</a><br/>
Needle and acupuncture practitioners test their skill with the flesh of living people. Surgeons invariably begin by using rotten medicine, causing the sores and pores to gradually enlarge, making it impossible to achieve a successful cure. This causes people to feel chilled and fearful. Afterwards, they are permitted to treat the patient themselves. Furthermore, they cannot control the outcome and inevitably meet with death; seven or eight out of ten cases result in this. This is the behavior of those who engage in reckless and incompetent practice. Moreover, minor ailments are treated with heavy medicine, and serious illnesses with light medicine – a reversal of what should be. This is a deceptive trick.<a id="trans-26p" href="#orig-26p" class="marker">[26p]</a><br/>
Unknowing of the way of the physician, benefit lies in treating diseases. When a disease is present, there is a corresponding medicine. It is not permissible to abandon the disease and disregard it. Therefore, one turns back to the medicine to treat it. This is a reversal and a misapplication. How many diseases, when not treated, do not worsen? The sick seek treatment repeatedly, but they invariably fall into the errors of their practice, believing their arguments are unique and different from the common ones. It is clearly evident that this is a true incompetent, yet makes a grave mistake. Furthermore, easy diseases are difficult to treat, and difficult diseases are easy to treat. Consider: if difficulty is made easy, it is a mistake.<a id="trans-27p" href="#orig-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br/>
It must be treated with a simple remedy to cure a grievous illness. The simple remedy is difficult. It must be treated with a wondrous and difficult remedy to cure a minor illness. The illness is like having no intention. This remedy is utterly inappropriate for it. The difficult case only makes the difficult case more difficult. The simple case is unchangeable. It is merely a mistake. How can it be saved? This is the state of a foolish yet exceedingly harmful person. Furthermore, they greedily take all they can obtain, and when encountering wealthy and refined households, they stubbornly refuse to seek the advice of a learned physician.<a id="trans-28p" href="#orig-28p" class="marker">[28p]</a><br/>
He sought ways to save himself, for procrastination had grown prolonged. He was on the verge of resorting to lavish expenditure of silver and land. Until, finally, he awaited death. He was helpless, abandoning all hope, subjected to the censure and abuse of his entire family, and fled without a plan. This was a case of a man’s spirit being utterly ruined. He frequently saw climbing vines along the road, yet high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants invariably possessed a clear strategy, and even when afflicted with dysentery and heatstroke, they invariably used bitter herbs such as ginseng, aconite, ginger, and radix rehmanniae – remedies that forcefully invigorated the vital essence, never daring to employ cooling medicines to dissipate heat.<a id="trans-29p" href="#orig-29p" class="marker">[29p]</a><br/>
He disregarded the advice of the physician, fearing his own aversion. One mistake led to another, creating a multitude of symptoms. Alas. Though he was a royal attendant and advisor, he was preoccupied with his own affairs. He did not, in turn, manage my affairs. He emphasized his own intentions while disregarding my life and well-being. How much more should one consider this! This is the nature of a man who is skilled but lacks purpose. A guest heard my words.<a id="trans-30p" href="#orig-30p" class="marker">[30p]</a><br/>
He rose abruptly and said, “You are a mediocre physician. You have exhausted all resources. What will you flee the blame to among heaven and earth?” He turned to consult the renowned physician of the imperial court, Lingtai. How can one argue that he deliberately slandered him in such a manner? I said, “This is surely not the utterance of Lingtai.” Lingtai studied six types of texts; his words were exceptionally profound and could be transmitted; never had he granted a lenient judgment to a mediocre physician.<a id="trans-31p" href="#orig-31p" class="marker">[31p]</a><br/>
To kill a man in a place unknown to others. And this is the bringing of misfortune from heaven. Also, it lies in a place unknown to others. A Prescription for Medicinal Science. Speaking of nourishing life. But it speeds death. The evils of the rivers and lakes, things that must be punished by the sage. All of this was written by his hands. How could he overlook a common physician being freed? And furthermore, how did he allow him to have even a small accomplishment, and thus condone his murder? Moreover, he establishes a doctrine that is utterly absurd and baseless. Having already stated that there are fixed rules regarding life and death.<a id="trans-32p" href="#orig-32p" class="marker">[32p]</a><br/>
If it is both like youth and like longevity, it is all under the control of destiny. Why then do they say that destiny has no power? Since they say that illness must arise, they cause it to lead to premature death. Therefore, those who suffer from illness are also under the control of destiny. How can it be that illness prevents death? Since they say that destiny has power, why do they single it out for emphasis, and yet must rely on physicians to make illness light or heavy, making heavy illness death? Therefore, the power of destiny is reversed and lies beneath the physicians.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br/>
I say that it is a matter of not knowing one’s destiny. Especially, it is not knowing the heavens. Consider: what business have the saviors of life and the physicians to have with causing death? Yet they are made to serve as demons and spirits, and consequently, the number of killings increases, and the achievements become greater. Killing a man for a benefit is a meritorious act, just as Hua Yuan killed Cao Jili, immersing himself in false affairs and truly becoming a great official. Then he wishes to kill, but cannot, which shows that its power still rests within the mandate of heaven, and it cannot be seized by a physician.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br/>
The late Zhang Wendan, esteemed official, claims that one’s life is blessed, and will not be ruined by a physician’s hand. Even if the medicine is wrongly administered, one will merely suffer greatly. This is the argument of Confucian scholars contending with each other. Physicians do not use this as an excuse. Indeed, Zhang used a foolish man to kill someone’s courage. Moreover, the argument itself is self-contradictory, as it states that one’s intentions are deceitful and that harming others is without calculation. Heaven does not send down punishment on this.<a id="trans-35p" href="#orig-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br/>
Its misfortune was invariably realized. Even when the spirit fetus was involved, it was merely a matter of idle writing and painting. When correcting and editing, not a single point was examined. Publicly issuing questions with the intent to mislead was a crime, appended at the end of the scroll. This deviated from the original intention, truly worthy of astonishment. The mind was inherently simple and ignorant, filled with pity, and when encountering those beyond salvation, it could not revive the dead, yet many cases were treated with various methods, yielding results.<a id="trans-36p" href="#orig-36p" class="marker">[36p]</a><br/>
Driven by circumstance, it could not be avoided. Like a fetus untouched by misfortune. Clear night, probing the heart. Sins and transgressions clustered. The book serves to warn people, and to warn oneself. The guest’s initial assent was repeated. A white man’s understanding was revealed. The Zen monk, a master of medicine, recounts the sins of mistaken physicians. Like casting a bronze vessel and burning a rhinoceros, it is strange and elusive. Immediately, the fetus awakens in the Nine Capitals.<a id="trans-37p" href="#orig-37p" class="marker">[37p]</a><br/>
He certainly regarded each other and laughed.  He slammed the case down in utter disbelief.  Remarkably skillful was his writing style.  He methodically refuted and questioned layer upon layer.  It was a truly satisfying and unrestrained outpouring.  No one who had not studied under Sima Qian for ten years could have accomplished this. (Brother Songqiao’s reading notes)<br/>
<br/>
Volume One: All Essays<br/>
<br/>
Reading an Account of Zhang Yang’s Prolonged Illness and the Case of a Physician’s Failure.<br/>
<br/>
It is noted that Zhang Yang’s illness stemmed from prolonged fever and confinement, lasting seven years, exhausting his family’s resources, and yet he could not be cured by one hundred thirteen physicians, and ultimately, he cured himself through self-treatment with excessively hot medicine.  Wang Mengying’s notes.<a id="trans-38p" href="#orig-38p" class="marker">[38p]</a><br/>
He repeatedly offered advice, but the heir still persisted in his folly. He then developed a chill and a headache. Numerous physicians treated him without effect. Consequently, he invited Meng Ying to examine him. Meng Ying diagnosed the condition based on the pulse. It was clearly a persistent internal heat, not something that could be dispersed by large doses of nitrobenzene-rhino horn. Such a forceful attack would not dispel the deeply entrenched evil. Furthermore, the evil and vital energies were mingled, like a bandit group entrenched in a valley, relying on its defenses and supported by malicious villagers. Even good people were compelled by circumstances to submit. Thus, it was not a strong army, but rather…<a id="trans-39p" href="#orig-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br/>
To possess the power to topple mountains and seas. Once its spirit is subdued, a single, decisive blow will bring it crashing down. It is certain to incite a throng to rise. Furthermore, how can one break a strong defense and strike with sharp troops? Victory depends on wielding authority, not on those who hold only a false understanding. The Ta Ai is held firmly in hand, therefore, all attempts to undermine it are met with resistance. Even with a hundred victories, unwavering loyalty cannot guarantee success; like the fates of Zhang, Han, Liu, Yue, and other great generals of the Song Dynasty, it ends in failure and lamentation.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a><br/>
And it could not be saved. Alas, how! Though medical skill is small, the use of medicine is the mechanism of life and death. Truly, there is a connection between healing and warfare. Like Wang Mengying’s expertise in medicine, his courage was as if he were four generals. Faced with ailments such as fear, weakness, cough, and phlegm, they were as if the land of Song, ravaged by war, were crumbling, with survival hanging on each breath. And within, there were slander, criticism, and ridicule coming from many quarters, while outside, there were accusations and slander from my own clan and party. It is as if this is like Qin Hui manipulating power in his own armpits.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a><br/>
Zhang Yangzhi remained obscure and unclear. Like the sons of Song—that is, the officials of the Song dynasty—Meng Ying could not display his skills. And he would certainly weep and lament to defeat the army. Nevertheless, Meng Ying and Zhang Yangzhi had been friends for many years. Observing his initial hesitation and his reaction upon seeing the plan, he began to speak of the benevolent and compassionate treatment of the king, and afterward, he would lie prostrate by his pillow, attentively listening. He was deeply moved. Consequently, those who had previously held such a firm belief, supported by unanimous agreement, were now almost entirely absent. However, at this juncture, if there were no one like Meng Ying.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a><br/>
All passion and fervor. To lay bare the whole matter. To leave him solely responsible for it. Without admitting any fault. Truly, can one turn a spring tide under one’s fingers? This reveals the nature of friendship and the importance of one’s life and position. Bitter and pointed accusations, up to this point. There is nothing more. There are still words like “Yùjù” and “Jiayang” that argue the matter. Though one bitterly expels his heart, abandoning all, it is often left to flow eastward with the passing water. Does he, the sick man, not truly know that he regards the present with boldness?<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a><br/>
The authorities were utterly deceived. Furthermore, they presented a false appearance of competence. It was like hindering and yet not hindering. But the foolish and ignorant would invariably believe it was a fortunate occurrence. When the fire of the prairie ablaze, it could not be extinguished, it was then realized the fault of not trusting a learned master. It was too late to regret. Indeed, the relationship between ruler and subject, the distinction of rank was unshakeable and could not be violated. One could not even openly confess one’s grief and sorrow, yet great wickedness and corruption arose from the oppression of the people.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br/>
Do not spare any effort. The more difficult the matter, the more ten, a hundred, a thousand times greater it becomes. This is the way of those with ambition. He read history until the time of Jingkang, and never ceased to discard books, sighing three times.<br/>
<br/>
He mastered strategy and medicine, studying history deeply. His roots were firm, and his branches flourished. Who would say the physician of three broken arms is not one who comes from the roots of heaven and the caves of the moon?<br/>
<br/>
Volume One, all essays. First, read the accounts of Wang Shuhe. It is better to study many cases as they arise, rather than simply reading Wang Shuhe.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br/>
Some say that the vital energies of the past and present are different, and therefore ancient medical formulas cannot treat illnesses of the present. This is a serious error made by many later students. It is like a craftsman diligently pursuing a trade. It is unnecessary to deeply investigate ancient methods. Rather, one should focus on listening to the symptoms. This is why the practice of medicine has increasingly declined. It is essential to first study, yet many have preconceived notions. Only through studying can one understand the changes in formulas. If one only relies on observing symptoms, even a large number of them are of no use. Indeed.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br/>
To treat, there must be both reinforcement and loosening. The method should not be rigidly fixed. Like a fever, it has both true and false aspects; it should be nourished, strengthened, and cooled, and also loosened. How can one know its true and false aspects without studying the classics? Just as a master craftsman cannot draw without a plumb line, how many fail to do so? Students must diligently study the ancient methods, following their established rules, and then they will understand the source of the illness and act with skill and intuition. This is the intention of the ancients.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br/>
This is the foundation of skillful craftsmanship. Skill arises from the rules. Only then is it true skill. If one employs tricks and artifices, then skill becomes clumsy. Thus said Mencius. A great craftsman uses rules for others, but not for himself; this necessarily means one must first master the rules, and then be able to generate skill. I believe that one must first study diligently before learning medicine, and then attend to the symptoms. This is the principle.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br/>
First, discern its truth. If one wishes to treat illness, it is essential to know the state of health before disease arises. The human organs and meridians, along with their vital energy, originally receive nourishment through diet, following a definite principle. The circulation of the vital force and defensive energy adheres to a regular pattern, with a fixed measure throughout the day and night. Relying on the upper and lower divisions of the body, it distinguishes between clarity and turbidity. Within the seven apertures, it receives the clear yang energy above and conducts the dark yin below. Breathing responds to opening and closing.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br/>
Movement and stillness divide into yin and yang. As for taking the pulse, four and five are considered normal. Three and two are considered deficient. Deficiency is then emptiness and cold. Six and seven are excessive. Excess is then solid and hot. The pulse’s movement responds to the flesh within. If, when pressed, the response comes from the skin but not the flesh, it is a floating ailment, and the disease lies on the surface. If pressing the muscle tissue does not elicit a pulse, one must press until it reaches the bone, and then the pulse will respond; this indicates a disease within.<a id="trans-50p" href="#orig-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br/>
To begin, one must first discern the fundamental flow of the body’s humors. Only then can one recognize the pattern of the illness. Knowing the overall framework of the body’s surface and interior—its emptiness and fullness—and further refining it by considering the specific organs and their seasonal variations, one can accurately identify the nature of the disease.  Therefore, a practitioner of medicine must first study the *Neijing* (Inner Canon). Indeed, the *Su Wen* (Questions and Answers) meticulously examines the viscera, their functioning of the vital energies (qi), the balance of yin and yang, color, pulse, and their constant changes.  All of this must be understood in detail.  For the unchanging is the fundamental principle, and understanding this allows one to respond to the myriad changes that arise from it, just as one must master the art of weaving silk.<a id="trans-51p" href="#orig-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br/>
Otherwise, confusion would arise in a chaotic manner. From where should one begin?<br/>
<br/>
Chapter One: Concerning the Discussion of Smoke-Dysentery.<br/>
<br/>
Smoke-dysentery is one of the symptoms. Formerly known as stagnation of the bowels. It arises from the accumulation and stagnation within the intestines, and then manifests. This ‘smoke-dysentery’ is merely a false name coined by later generations. The ancients have discussed this in detail. Now, the common name is ‘smoke-dysentery,’ and the methods for treating it are applied. If it is not opened, it becomes constricted; and this is also what the ancient texts state. Recently, smoke has entered China, and those who have become ill with dysentery are called ‘smoke-dysentery.’<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br/>
The sick and injured first become timid. It is absolutely necessary to seek drastic remedies quickly. The physician does not understand this principle. He habitually employs gentle remedies to relieve congestion, thereby damaging the condition. Therefore, he was compelled to explain the matter. It is a great absurdity that a person who smokes habitually has a multitude of dry obstructions. If he changes his clothes only five or six days a week, it is ten or more days before he changes them at all. And the food he consumes is not necessarily the same as that consumed by those who do not smoke. Thus, the accumulation within his intestines, over a long period, is far beyond what can be cured.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br/>
He invariably became accustomed to it and then felt at ease. I personally witnessed a family with a particular habit. They habitually indulged in tobacco. Their addiction was quite severe. Later, due to busyness with affairs in his office, he had no time to smoke. He constantly experienced withdrawal symptoms. He fell ill with dysentery for several months, his body becoming like a skeleton. The abdominal pain worsened. A physician prescribed medicine, and he excreted a large amount of black feces, resembling the expelled tobacco bubbles. Consequently, he recovered.<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br/>
And the opium addiction was thus ended. Furthermore, there was another Bao surname man. He first began to smoke foreign opium, and after the business ceased, he quit and did not resume it. It has been more than two years. He suffers severely from dysentery, exhaustion, and distress, and is unable to seek medical treatment. He daily seeks out elixirs, and one day he obtained one hundred and twenty-five *liang* (ounces) of such a substance. The people said this thing could kill lice. How could he take so much as one hundred and twenty-five *liang*? It should be reduced. The patient firmly believes it will cure him.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br/>
He took the medicine. His abdomen was large and painful. People were extremely alarmed. Shortly afterward, he ascended the latrine. He obtained a number of small black worms in several bowls. He felt as if he had lost his vitality. He self-administered black porridge for nourishment. He did not take medicine. His stomach energy gradually strengthened, and his body grew robust and vigorous, reversing his former condition. However, the urgency to defecate remained. This was not true for those who did not eat smoke. Also, there was one man from Ningbo.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a><br/>
A traveler visited the land of Min. He ate over one hundred fresh lychees in a single day. It had been more than ten years since he had returned to Ning. He had suffered from chronic diarrhea that would not heal. A physician examined him, saying that although the illness had been long-lasting, his abdomen resisted pressure, and there was a significant accumulation of stagnation. He advised him to purge it, using nitrate-yellow powder and similar medicines. After taking the medicine, he expelled a great deal of undigested food, all of which were fresh lychees. Afterward, he suddenly fell ill. This clearly shows the accumulation of food in the intestines and stomach.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a><br/>
Though it has been more than ten years. it still does not transform. It remains the original substance, exuding. Formerly, dysentery was called stagnation of the bowels. The naming clearly indicates this. For those who do not smoke, those afflicted with this illness should take measures to promote downward movement and clear the air. Nine out of ten cases are due to this. And those who have long-standing illnesses of pure deficiency… the spirit gate is not closed, and the abdomen does not ache. Those who have loose bowel movements without restraint and do not realize it – these must be considered separately.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a><br/>
In short, concerning those who smoke. The intestines accumulate phlegm. The longer they smoke, the harder it becomes. How can it be stopped to relieve the obstruction? Some say that the body of a smoker is inherently deficient. If one continues to introduce fluids, it cannot be guaranteed that it will not cause a violent expulsion. I say, the error of physicians and healers lies solely in this statement. Because the accumulation of phlegm prevents the spleen from properly transporting the fluids of the stomach, and the stomach has stagnant phlegm that cannot be cleared, it inevitably cannot receive new fluids.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br/>
The muscles gradually became thinner. Superficial manifestations of illness appeared repeatedly. If one were to accumulate a little filth, the stomach would be able to receive it, and the spleen would be able to transport it. There would be no escape from this. However, when a physician sees these superficial symptoms, if he immediately prescribes a remedy, all patients vomit and have swollen tongues. This is the difficulty. The physician should instead skillfully guide the patient, stabilize the situation, and this is one of the ways to save a person. Do not blindly follow one’s own ideas and forcefully treat, for this is to harm a person.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a><br/>
I again request that you consider the principles of correspondence and proportion. For example, take a lamp burning for a long time. If the oil is sufficient, the lamp will shine brightly. If the oil runs out, the lamp will go dark. This is a natural principle. Then, even after burning for a long time, the oil still remains. This is because it has solidified on top. If you do not remove this, the lamp will inevitably go dark, and you will only add more oil in an attempt to make the lamp shine. This is exceedingly difficult. It is clear from this that the true essence lies within.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a><br/>
Observing illusory appearances externally, it is either a matter of strengthening or of suppressing. This is what is said in the *Nei Jing*. When the vital energy departs from the emptiness, it returns. The most frequent illness among young children in autumn is diarrhea caused by summer heat and filth combined with food stagnation. This occurs in seventy-eight out of ten cases. Treatment involves fragrant herbs to invigorate the spleen and expel filth. For internal summer heat and evil, it is supplemented with items that transform and eliminate stagnation. A course of two to three doses results in immediate recovery. If, however, the condition persists for a long time due to a deficient spleen, it is supplemented with items to strengthen the spleen.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a><br/>
I treat the disease with this remedy. There is no need to use my hands to heal it. However, the condition often manifests with repeated occurrences. Its diet should avoid warm and dry foods, leading to the dryness and exhaustion of stomach juices, preventing the application of damp cloths and resulting in a condition of abdominal hardness and cough, resembling the symptoms of malnutrition. Such remedies as fragrant flowers, such as藿香 (huǒ xiāng), cangpu (菖蒲), péilan yè (佩兰叶), and fan shou gan (佛手柑) are suitable for feverish heat. For summer heat, fresh lotus leaves, fresh wormwood, Li Si San (六一散), black栀 (黑山栀), qin (条芩), and chuan lian (川连) are appropriate. Bitter flavors strengthen the bowels, and also serve to stop diarrhea. For evacuation, broad-leaved ginger, musk, betel nut, and the peel of the abdomen are used.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br/>
Eliminate stagnation by using Shenqi (music), gǔ yá (barley sprouts), má yá (wheat sprouts), shānzhá (hawthorn), wǔshí chá (noon tea), wǔ gǔ chóng (five grain worms), jī nèi jīn (chicken inner gold) and similar items. Strengthen the spleen by using Western Ginseng,茯苓 (buckwheat), sautéed Mai Dong (Monotropa acaule), sautéed broad beans, licorice, and粳米 (glutinous rice) and similar items. Nourish the stomach yin by using Stone Fungus, Mai Dong, Pawpaw, and Wu Mei (Prunus armeniaca) and similar items. Promote urination by using Chéngqi zhī zi (Carpet Ear), Zéxiě (Rheum officinale), Huáshí (calcium carbonate) and similar items. Kill insects by using Húhuánglián (Houttuynia cordata), Rǔzi (a type of fungus), Shǐjūnzǐ (a medicinal herb), and Betel Nut and similar items. However, one must always supplement with sweet sorghum to entice them. This is to make the insects prefer sweetness and seek food. For treating children’s diarrhea and dysentery, one always uses Ka Guen (Valerian root). Refer to the Guan Ye Shi Shu (Guan Ye’s Medical Treatise). One must know what to avoid. All of these medicines are plain and unremarkable; their effectiveness changes infinitely when skillfully applied.<a id="trans-64p" href="#orig-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br/>
In the autumn, various illnesses afflicted young children. Some suffered from疳积 (gan jue), with hard, swollen bellies and protruding blue veins. Others experienced 疰夏 (kua xia), refusing to eat and becoming progressively emaciated. Still others presented with symptoms of 肝强 (gan qiang), characterized by frequent anger and crying. All such conditions could be treated by altering the regimen. <br/>
<br/>
However, the medicines used were limited to a few of the above-mentioned flavors. It is understood that the illnesses of young children are primarily rooted in the liver and spleen meridians; their diets and the consumption of fruits and vegetables damaged the spleen and stomach, and their internal organs were weak and unable to effectively transform and regulate bodily fluids.<a id="trans-65p" href="#orig-65p" class="marker">[65p]</a><br/>
Changes give rise to various illnesses. Formerly it was said that damage to the food and aversion to food were the cause. It was also said that if one cares for young children, one should often give them a third of their body’s hunger and cold. This is truly the essential point.<br/>

Chapter One, All Discussions<br/>
<br/>
A Discussion on the Effectiveness of Radish Greens in Treating Diarrhea<br/>
<br/>
Diarrhea is most prevalent in the summer and autumn, often resulting from the accumulation of heat and filth in the diet. Radish greens are the most suitable treatment. It should be done on the winter solstice. The roots and leaves should be placed on the roof, exposed to the wind, rain, frost, and snow. Harvested at Qingming Festival. The inner hollow should be loosened like a braid, and it is called radish greens.<a id="trans-66p" href="#orig-66p" class="marker">[66p]</a><br/>
The body clears summer heat and eliminates accumulated stagnation. Again, it is affected by the alternation of rain, snow, sun, and cold. It receives the pure air of heaven, to dispel the turbidity of the intestines. Whether red or white diarrhea, the effect is extremely efficacious. Yet wealthy and noble families disdain its worth, discard it, and do not use it. Alas, how can we know that even things of little value possess the utmost efficacy? If one can control and bestow it, then blessings will be immeasurable. Indeed, this thing is of the utmost poverty.<a id="trans-67p" href="#orig-67p" class="marker">[67p]</a><br/>
Those who devote their minds to helping others can be controlled by anyone. It is wished that physicians should widely recount their cases, for this is also a source of benefit. The entire *Nei Jing* contains no word for “phlegm.” Master Jinwei also classified cough and phlegm as belonging to the same category. This led to later generations treating phlegm solely by focusing on the lungs, unaware that ancient people considered the kidneys to be the root of phlegm production, and the stomach to be the vessel for storing it.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a><br/>
Entering the lung produces phlegm. Phlegm and mucus are together, both transformations of fluid. This fluid originates in the stomach, and is returned to water and grain. Refining air and preserving essence creates this fluid, which then rises to the lung and descends to nourish the spleen. Consequently, it travels with the vital energy and fluids. Phlegm arises from air and permeates throughout the four limbs and the top of the head, reaching everywhere. Therefore, internal injury and external invasion can both generate phlegm. Treat external invasion and cold with warmth.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br/>
Fire clears the channels. To treat internal injuries with deficiency, nourish them. To strengthen, purge. When obstructions rise, induce vomiting. When stagnation is present, attack it. This is a general outline. For example, phlegm arises from the influence of wind; then use a light dosage to clear it from the surface. Wind is a pathogenic factor that enters the channels from the skin and hair, gradually reaching the lungs and stomach, inevitably causing the essence of water and grain to descend and cannot ascend, resulting in the formation of phlegm.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br/>
Still, one should expect expectoration from the lung orifices. The lung position is highest. Therefore, light doses are appropriate. Wind chills invade the interior, treated with pungency and coolness, supplemented with bitterness and sweetness. Wu’s Silver Flower Powder Decoction, Mulberry and Vegetable Root Drink are suitable. If the wind has transformed into heat, causing the stomach’s juices to vaporize into phlegm, then clear stomach-regulating substances should be added. *Zhimo* (Mother of Pearl), *huafan* (flower pollen), *shigao* (calcium carbonate), *zhuye* (bamboo leaves) are appropriate. If one is afflicted by cold invasion resulting in phlegm, the orifices are constricted and the lung energy is reversed and full; the solar energy is deficient.<a id="trans-71p" href="#orig-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br/>
Without a way to vent, it is proper to use preparations such as apricot kernel, jujube, sweet almond, and hemp seed powders. If the heat is excessive, supplement with bai mu ren (licorice root), zhi mu (Cyperus rotundus), sang pi (mulberry bark), and shan zhi (Forrestia paniculata). If the heat is caused by the ingress of evil through the mouth and nose, proceed directly to the midline.<br/>
<br/>
Entering into the stomach, it forms stagnation and becomes heat phlegm. It is proper to use White Tiger Soup and Bamboo Leaf Stone Mortar Soup. To dispel the heat evil. If dampness is stagnated in the center, the spleen and stomach are unable to elevate and descend, causing obstruction and phlegm. It is necessary to invigorate the spleen and clear the stomach. Invigorating the spleen uses preparations such as Kong Pu (thick bark of Magnolia), Gan Jiang (dried ginger), Fu Pi (peel of the tree), Shan Zhai (Chinese hawthorn), Fulong (pourtougon), Chang Mu (greater mulbery), Huagong (anise), Dou Mu (cardamom), and Ju Pi (orange peel).<a id="trans-72p" href="#orig-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br/>
Clear the stomach with bamboo shoots, calamus, chi mu, licorice, and powder of flowers. Sometimes, add flavors of damp-seeping and water-flowing. If dampness and stagnation transform into feverish symptoms, it is appropriate to promote dampness dissipation and clear heat. Such as calamus, chuan xiao, chi, pine bark, bean curd, dong cao, and smooth stone. See Wu Shi’s *Tiao Bian* and Xue Shi’s *Shi Re Bing Pian*. If caused by autumn’s golden and dry air, it consumes the moisture and fluids of the lungs and stomach, transforming them into phlegm. It is appropriate to nourish the yin of the lungs and stomach. Refer to Yu Shi’s *Zhu Qing Zao Jiu Fei Tang*, and sometimes supplement with five juices to nourish yin and cool the body, and moisten dryness. Such as snow congee is also appropriate.<a id="trans-73p" href="#orig-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br/>
And thus, within the realm of excessive indulgence, bile is most readily generated by heat. Heat possesses a distinction of leadership. The division of the five viscera. Treatment of liver heat involves bitter expulsion. Treatment of stomach heat involves bitter suppression. Bitter expulsion differs from bitter suppression. Bitter expulsion includes mountain栀, qīngdàiyè, lóngdàn, lúhuí, zhūchǎn. Bitter suppression includes dàhuáng, huánglián, huángqín, zhīmǔ, huángbǎi, zhǐshí. Furthermore, when phlegm stagnates for a long time, it transforms into heat. When this heat rises upwards, it causes怔忡 (zhèngchōng),眩晕 (xuányūn), and不寐 (bùmèi). When it enters the meridians, it causes pain, paralysis, numbness, and tuberculosis.<a id="trans-74p" href="#orig-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br/>
Entering at the channels and collaterals will cause stagnation to become carbuncles and ulcers.  Descending to the lower viscera will inevitably result in paralysis, apoplexy, withered limbs, bone ulcers, and convulsions.  Typically, it causes palpitations, dizziness, insomnia, and restlessness.  It is appropriate to clear heat to treat the liver, supplemented with drugs to calm the spirit, such as the horn of a white cow, mulberry leaves, cinnabar bark, bitter orange, hookvine, nutmeg, Chinese Privet, Lycium Lawsonii, Psoralea Corylifolia, Indigo, Oystershell, and Stone Liverwort preparations.  Pain, paralysis, numbness, then it is appropriate to use controlling saliva pills, rolling phlegm pills, and the preparations of ginger juice and bamboo juice.  The fundamental cause of these conditions is phlegm, which cannot be expelled.<a id="trans-75p" href="#orig-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br/>
One must inevitably submit to this treatment. It results in the consolidation of flesh and bone into boils and carbuncles. It is appropriate to adjust and harmonize the vital energies (营卫) and supplement them with fragrant substances to penetrate the channels (络).  Specifically, use rhinoceros horn, white peony (Bai Jie Zi), almond kernel, musk, storax, tallow, and related materials. It attacks the stagnation and promotes dispersion.  It is appropriate for wind paralysis, rheumatic pains, bone carbuncles.  Then use a large dose of vital energy-regulating medicine and the medicine for controlling saliva.  It is appropriate for phlegm, convulsions, mania, epilepsy, insanity, dullness, and stupor.  It is also appropriate to remove the phlegm from the channels. First use the Lihuluo Decoction to expel it. Until the symptoms are severe and the mouth is constricted.<a id="trans-76p" href="#orig-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br/>
Grind the mulberries into powder. Administer the powder into the nostrils. It can induce vomiting. If the vomiting continues, administer warm onion broth, which will relieve it. Then use yellow beeswax and clear heart pills, or white gold pills, to dispel remaining external pathogenic influences. Subsequently, use a tranquilizing and calming pill. Observe the results with care. There is no failure, and it works like a god. All of the above are methods for treating external pathogenic influences. If there is an underlying internal injury, coldness and drinking cold liquids injure the lungs. When the lungs are injured, cold pathogenic influences become congested internally, and this manifests as vomiting.<a id="trans-77p" href="#orig-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br/>
He inevitably coughed up the reverse flow of his illness, a hacking cough. A watery sound like a water hen was heard in his throat. He then prescribed Golden Medical’s Support Drink, Suspended Drink, and it was correct. If the symptoms were mild, he would prescribe the Subduing Wind Decoction. If severe, he would prescribe the Small Green Dragon Decoction and the Shooting Deadlock Decoction. Since it was a cold invasion, warm-dispelling remedies were indispensable. If the diet was irregular, he suffered from hunger and overeating, and exhaustion damaged the spleen. Because the spleen’s yang was not rising, he should prescribe the Restore Middle and Benefit Qi Decoction and the Small Build Middle Decoction, adjusting the internal conditions so that the phlegm would naturally transform.<a id="trans-78p" href="#orig-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br/>
Sudden anger harms the liver. The Qi of the liver is inverted and attacks the stomach. It also generates phlegm. Furthermore, there will be pain in the side, vomiting, bitter taste, and belching with sourness. It is appropriate to use Xiao Yao San with danpi (den-pi), shanzhi (shan-zhi), qingdai (qing-dai), and zhuru (zhu-ru). Alternatively, use Yue Ju Wan, using qingdai as the covering. Or add shihu (shi-hu), mugua (mugua), wu mei (wu-mei), chuanlian (chuan-lian) and others to level the stomach Qi. Or use dai zhe, hai shi, ji lie, and others to subdue the liver. If the earth and wood are not disturbed, then it will be at peace.<br/>
<br/>
Like when one is injured by sexual exhaustion, phlegm arises. It also inevitably causes shortness of breath, inversion of the Qi, and inability to lie down. However, it shares similarities with the shortness of breath caused by cold evil attacking the lungs.<a id="trans-79p" href="#orig-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br/>
Wind-evil harms the lungs. Its pulse will be tight and stringy. Sometimes it is sunken and fine, with the pulse at the cun (notch) smooth and sliding several times.<br/>
<br/>
Kidney deficiency causes wheezing and reversed flow. Its pulse will be weak and large. The superficial pulse will be floating. It can be pressed and examined.<br/>
<br/>
Water manifests as phlegm. It should be treated by warming and nourishing. Light cases use Jian Zhong Tang. Heavy cases use Er Jia Long Mu Tang. Or Eight-Ingredient Kidney Qi Pill made into a decoction to warm the kidneys and stop the water from rising.<a id="trans-80p" href="#orig-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br/>
And the phlegm and wheezing naturally disappeared. According to the Classic, when the essence is deficient, it is supplemented with [medicinal] substances. Therefore, one must invariably use locust bean curd, angelica, deer horn glue, thorny barberry, conus aureus, duriuso, bugleweed, and bone-nourishing fat. Only then could it be effectively treated. Long-standing and aged phlegm, having solidified in the cavities and vessels, must be treated according to the method of Mr. Yu, to expel it. Furthermore, one must subsequently supplement it with spleen-tonifying medicine, serving as a filling-up strategy. The chest and abdomen became filled with phlegm, solidifying into a habit, and when it was large, it resembled a pot or a basin; one must use pills to attack it.<a id="trans-81p" href="#orig-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br/>
The ingredients included were da Huang, San Leng, E Jue, Gui Xu, Tao Ren, Ba Dou, and Lai Zheng Zi, all to be used in pill form. However, one must not exceed the prescribed dosage, as it would injure the vital energy. I, in my attempt to treat phlegm, had previously devised methods that were misguided and lacked clarity.<br/>
<br/>
Volume One, all the discussions, advocated for dividing throat disorders into three main categories. Throat disorders were previously categorized into seventy-two distinct items, but these three main categories effectively encompassed them. What are the three main categories? One is throat and eyelid inflammation, another is throat dysfunction, and the third is throat wind.<a id="trans-82p" href="#orig-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br/>
At the outset, there was chills and fever. The body was round and swollen, with a red complexion and pulse that was sometimes rapid and sometimes constricted. Treatment was applied when the lesion was just beginning to discharge pus. Small incisions were recommended. The remedies consisted of Shang, Shao Chong, Zhong Chong, and bloodletting. Drugs suitable for detoxification and edema included silver flowers, red peony, cinnabar bark, yellow gentian, yellow chrysanthemum, soapwood, licorice root, mu danxia, and tortoise shell. Medications were administered by inhalation.  A mixture known as “Sparse Saliva Dispersion” and “Gate Opening Powder” were also used. Occasionally, tung oil was employed to expel phlegm, and the orifices were opened to facilitate drainage.  Following this, the swelling subsided, and the patient was able to resume eating within four to five days.<a id="trans-83p" href="#orig-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br/>
The pus has hardened. Its color may be red or purple. The pulse is thick and numerous. It must be pierced to drain the infected area, expelling the pus and toxic blood. Internally, administer drugs to clear heat and detoxify. Such as silver flowers, Japanese knotweed, safflower, gardenia, turmeric, licorice root, chrysanthemum, and earthworm root. Externally, apply medications to discharge pus and detoxify, such as turmeric, chrysanthemum, potassium nitrate, peppermint, borax. Add a small amount of fine powder and beeswax. If it does not heal after a long time, it is named ‘rot throat moth,’ which has two types: true and false.<a id="trans-84p" href="#orig-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br/>
The pale is white and rotten. The pulse is weak and numerous. The solid is purple and the pulse is firm and tense. The pale is to be treated with ginseng, Rong Tang, and Sheng Mai San, etc. The solid is to be treated with fresh chrysanthemum leaves, purple orchid root, etc. There is a great deal of fire poison, so one uses芩, 黄, and 丹皮 to cleanse it. If it is severe, one adds犀角 and 大黄. Sore throat paralysis arises from the conjunction of the two fires of yin and yang. Its form resembles a small chess piece. Initially, it presents with no fever or chills, a symptom of a surface illness. After ten or more days, it becomes pus-filled. The Internal Classic says: one yin and one yang combine to form sore throat paralysis.<a id="trans-85p" href="#orig-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br/>
One is the Hand Lesser Yang vein, which is the vital energy of the Fire Official. The other is the Hand Greater Yang vein, which is the vital energy of the Three Organs. The two veins connect at the throat. When the vital energy is abundant, it becomes congested and swollen. When the swelling is severe, the vital energy becomes paralyzed, and the paralysis closes. Therefore, in treating throat paralysis, one should primarily use items to disperse knots and clear fire. Initially, it is advisable to prick the Shao Shang and other acupuncture points to induce bleeding. The treatment is similar to treating throat edema. The prescription should include items such as Chrysanthemum, Silkworm Cocoons, and Jade Pivot Powder to disperse knots. Medications such as Lu Xue, Pin Xue, and Tin Powder dispersals should be used. Only for throat wind-type syndromes.<a id="trans-86p" href="#orig-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br/>
Unlike previous cases, the treatment is markedly different. The symptoms themselves are also distinct. Initially, the swelling is widespread and does not rise. Sometimes it extends to the neck, invariably causing fever and chills, with a rapid pulse. The phlegm and viscous fluid are congested. Initially, general treatment, disinfection, Zhang Shi’s Six-Flavor Decoction, and adjustments based on the specific condition are appropriate. Blowing medication should focus on dispersing phlegm and promoting qi. Such medications include soapwort, peppermint, silkworm cocoon, person-in-the-middle, yellow chrysanthemum, yellow gentian, borax, and ice-petal. If the condition ulcerates and turns purple, pearl, ox gall, and amber should be added to promote regeneration and eliminate toxins. If the condition is prolonged and becomes emaciated, it is like a wound exposed to the sun.<a id="trans-87p" href="#orig-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br/>
White color, pulse weak. Warm, strengthening drugs are appropriate. Blowing the powder should not be excessive in coldness. Such as starflower, chuanxiong, beeswax, and calamine are to be avoided. Appropriate are amber, pearl, drop jade, white man’s bone, cinnabar. Nourishes the flesh and harmonizes the blood. Also addresses tongue paralysis, throat wind, stifled throat wind. These are manifestations of intense internal poison. Heavy use of detoxification is necessary. Throat wind, when genuine, is wind poison ascending. Treatment involves pungent, cooling, and light expulsion.<a id="trans-88p" href="#orig-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br/>
He ceased attempting to cure the underlying disease. His face was pale and his eyes wide. For minor cases, one administered gypsum with eight herbs plus a single ingot of Jade Pivot Pills, grinding them together. This must be done by opening the upper channels and warming the lower ones. There are many books on throat disorders. This is a general overview, and further contemplation and deduction will suffice. Recently, a book titled “On Throat Disease” appeared, arguing that the three yin deficiencies were the primary causes. Throat disorders are found within the Hand Classic. They are not related to the Stomach Classic. Ancient texts on this matter are available.<a id="trans-89p" href="#orig-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br/>
Having the meridians inverted is a matter of profound foolishness. The enlightened understand their own limitations. Let us not delve deeply into this matter.<br/>
<br/>
Volume One, Discourse on Throat Disorders, Section on the Use of Medications for Throat Disorders. The use of medications for throat disorders is the essential external treatment; it should not be disregarded. It is based on the fact that surgeons often do not understand the properties of medicines. They combine several common remedies for general treatment. If, when encountering serious cases, they do not diligently attempt to adapt their treatments, they will inevitably make mistakes. Especially with throat disorders and the use of medications, it is crucial to tailor the prescriptions to the specific symptoms and meticulously prepare fine powders.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br/>
The medicine and symptoms correspond. Success is swift. Initially, there was swelling and pain. The jaw did not open. Phlegm and saliva ascended. It should be treated with Jade Pivot Pills, and the juice of tea should be ground and used to rinse the mouth. Or, tooth soap should be used to open the mouth, or tung oil should be applied with a feather to dip and insert into the throat to remove the phlegm. Immediately, the orifice would open and the ability to eat would be restored. If the jaw was urgent and did not open, it could be ground into powder and used.<a id="trans-91p" href="#orig-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br/>
Blow into the nostrils, and the mouth will open. Or, powder of angelica root blown into the nostril can also expel phlegm and open the mouth. Or, fresh mugwort rubbed on the cheeks produces the same effect. If a pus-like swelling occurs, break it open at the affected area, removing the pus and toxic blood. If fearful of knives and needles, use the powder of human fingernails, copper coins, and dried clay, adding a small amount of ice, blown into the affected area, can also penetrate it. This is called “Knife-Dispelling Powder.” If there is swelling, pain, and phlegm blockage, this method is effective.<a id="trans-92p" href="#orig-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br/>
Jade Pivot Ginseng, earth ox knee root, ten thousand year green root, pounded and infused into vinegar, two or three drops into the mouth is most effective. Borax, sandalwood nitrate, copper sulfate, ox bile, nitrate of alum. All can eliminate swelling, neutralize poison, and dispel corruption. Red swelling and fever are intense. Then yellow knotweed, yellow chrysanthemum, bluefish bile, blue indigo, and western loquat frost can all clear heat and detoxify. Wind-heat and fever ascending, it is appropriate to use cooling remedies such as peppermint, silkworm chrysalis, ice-leaf, and blue indigo. For severe poison, it is appropriate to use western ox bile, male spirit, white manchu, as a good medicine for detoxification. Fresh ulcers and rotten flesh do not generate, it is appropriate to use pearl, western yellow, cinnabar, amber, etc. to generate new skin. However, it must be completely rotten before it can be used.<a id="trans-93p" href="#orig-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br/>
If rotten flesh is not removed, then use fresh skin and medicine. This only invites poison and evil within, and prevents complete mastery. It is best to understand this. The medicines used for throat disorders are few. Knowing their nature and applying them according to the symptoms produces extraordinary effects. A cure can be achieved in a moment. Volume One, Chapter on Punction, Chapter on Punction: Punction is the true secret method passed down by the Master. Applying it to the patient produces immediate results. This method was later forbidden from being taught.<a id="trans-94p" href="#orig-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br/>
The practice of discarding and not using established methods has led to a near loss of the tradition. Indeed, young children’s viscera are soft and fragile. When exposed to the assaults of wind-cold, summer heat, and dampness, they may even develop a fever. Furthermore, a sudden fright can cause the liver and gallbladder to release their energies, resulting in fever arising internally, and blood becoming heated and turbulent. The physician, unable to discern the root of the illness, issues prescriptions that are unclear and disordered, thereby damaging the soft and fragile viscera of young children.<a id="trans-95p" href="#orig-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br/>
To still remain deficient. What can be added to intensify the potent nature of the medicine? Surely it cannot increase the illness caused by the medicine. How about the method of pushing? It is firm and yet quickly effective. Recently this method has become prevalent, but those who are skilled are few. Its method divides the five major organs with the five fingers; the tips of the fingers belong to the organs, the roots belong to the viscera; heat, cold, dampness, and dryness, to purge and to nourish, to rectify rightness and to correct wrongness, to turn left and to turn right.<a id="trans-96p" href="#orig-96p" class="marker">[96p]</a><br/>
Turn right, push left. This establishes the method of warming, clearing, and promoting evacuation. There are several subsequent steps. Sometimes three hundred, sometimes five hundred. Do not arbitrarily push. There is also kneading to manipulate and pinching to shock. The surface areas each govern specific parts: the abdomen, the belly, the hands, and the feet. All can be massaged. There are ten major hand techniques, a secret method of the original teacher. If one can master this art, they can practice it widely.<a id="trans-97p" href="#orig-97p" class="marker">[97p]</a><br/>
Then the illnesses of young children. It has ceased to be necessary to worry about their untimely deaths. Volume One, all the discussions, regarding the treatment of young children, the medicine should be administered lightly. The organs of young children are soft and fragile. Medicine cannot be effectively transported and transformed within them. Therefore, medicine should be administered lightly. For example, when afflicted by external wind-cold, medicines to loosen the muscles and clear the surface should be used in small quantities. Each flavor should be used in just a few grains. The amount of medicine should not be excessive. For if the medicine is too heavy and abundant, it will reverse the illness, and the illness will inevitably fail to heal. Only the two pox-related illnesses require a heavier dosage, and should not be administered lightly.<a id="trans-98p" href="#orig-98p" class="marker">[98p]</a><br/>
The remedy’s power is insufficient. It cannot be cured. Why is this so? It concerns the two pox symptoms. They arise from the full manifestation of congenital fire poison externally. Therefore, a person experiences this only once in their life, unlike the usual illnesses. Observe the case of Mr. Ye; one should recognize this.<br/>
<br/>
Volume One, All Discussions<br/>
<br/>
Regarding prescriptions, acupuncture, massage, thin-sheet applications, steaming – each has its appropriate uses in treating illness.<br/>
<br/>
Treatments begin with Yi Fang Yin. The evil of the six淫 is found in the surface, the skin, the营 and卫, and the six internal organs. It is appropriate to use decoctions when the evil is in the surface; when it is in the skin, it is appropriate to use remedies to dispel it; when it is in the 营 and卫, it is appropriate to harmonize them; when it enters the six internal organs, it is appropriate to use remedies to harmonize them.<a id="trans-99p" href="#orig-99p" class="marker">[99p]</a><br/>
Those that reside on the diaphragm should be expelled. Those that reside in the intestines should be excreted. Those that reside in the viscera cannot be fully controlled by medicinal decoctions; their nature is already beyond reach. For lung diseases, remedies of dispersion are often used. Since the lung occupies the highest position, medication should be light. For the heart, liver, and spleen, some should be taken as pills and others as granules. Because of their deep and secluded locations. Treatment should be slow. The kidneys are often deficient and rarely manifested as excessive. Therefore, pills or pastes are often used.<a id="trans-100p" href="#orig-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br/>
To remedy deficiency, employ flavors. Specifically, those with deficient kidneys should take items with turbid and concentrated flavors, or items resembling blood and flesh with sentience. These should be fashioned into pastes or pills, utilizing similar substances to elicit a response. Only then can they effectively treat the ailment. For illnesses residing within the meridians, or manifesting as pain, stagnation, or spasms, one must use fine needles to adjust the exterior. Further supplement with medicinal wine to harmonize the interior, thereby restoring the meridians and curing the illness.<a id="trans-101p" href="#orig-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br/>
They employed medicinal baits. Illnesses invariably failed to heal, especially those of young children with convulsions. Twenty-four distinct remedies were used for such convulsions. Acute illnesses required massage. Furthermore, acupuncture was applied to treat smallpox in children and adults with blood stasis and obstruction. Stone needles were necessary for removing noxious blood. All long-standing, cold-induced lumps and accumulations, as well as chronic ulcers and cold-induced deficiencies, could not be cured without acupuncture.<a id="trans-102p" href="#orig-102p" class="marker">[102p]</a><br/>
Swelling, ulcers, pain, and stagnation were all treated with thin plasters. However, the illnesses differed in yin and yang, and the medicines varied in cold and heat. For example, pain in the joints, pain in the muscles and bones, required warming and steaming to draw out the poison. Therefore, the illnesses were divided according to the deployment of the muscles, skin, channels, meridians, bones, qi, blood, organs, upper, middle, and lower parts. And the treatment methods for each were distinct. The Sage Emperors established a system that was unchanging. Later physicians could not understand it, and they invariably used formulas to treat all diseases, but their treatments were invariably unsuccessful.<a id="trans-103p" href="#orig-103p" class="marker">[103p]</a><br/>
Many illnesses extend into old age. Therefore, those who practice medicine must deeply study ancient methods and master a wide range of books. Then they can control the situation at hand, and their actions will be like those of a god.<br/>
<br/>
Chapter One, Several Discussions:<br/>
<br/>
On the inadvisability of lightly taking medicine.<br/>
<br/>
The Four Qi of the *Nei Jing* are the foundation for nourishing the body. Grain, vegetables, fruits, and livestock should be consumed in moderation. Excessive eating leads to imbalances and illness.<a id="trans-104p" href="#orig-104p" class="marker">[104p]</a><br/>
Excessive consumption of pungent foods leads to stiff muscles and withered claws. Excessive consumption of sour foods causes flesh to soften and the lips to crack. Excessive consumption of sweet foods causes bone pain and hair loss. This is the effect of these five flavors. However, grain is what sustains all living beings and embodies the nature of all things, maintaining balance and harmony. Therefore, people continue to eat their accustomed diet even into old age. The ancient method of treating illness involved restoring health with grain-based remedies. No one attempted to excessively strengthen the body after illness, as exemplified by Zhang Zhongjing, the originator of the Six-Pillars Classic. Examining the Treatise on Febrile and Non-Febrile Diseases and the Golden Chamber Classics.<a id="trans-105p" href="#orig-105p" class="marker">[105p]</a><br/>
Its formulas were all for treating illness. Formulas for replenishing deficiencies were very few. Later scholars only possessed the methods of Zhang Zai and De. When illness subsided, he instructed people to nourish themselves with millet porridge. This did not contradict the principles of the *Inner Canon*. However, the prevalence of replenishing formulas began with Zhang Jue, Zhao Yangkui, and then followed by Shi Lizhai. Later generations merely feared their names, believing them to be credible. Those who imitated them misled others without calculation. Examining their cases, they all employed methods to strengthen the middle burner.<a id="trans-106p" href="#orig-106p" class="marker">[106p]</a><br/>
The prescription of Xiaoyao San, Gui Pi Tang, and San Fang. It treats all diseases. Other methods are rarely employed. It is readily apparent from this that the four seasons—wind, cold, heat, and dampness—contain influences that affect humans. When these influences are present, they are termed “evil airs.” When a person is in the midst of these conflicting influences, it is impossible to avoid damage; the wind harms the Wei, cold harms the Yang, heat harms the Qi, and dampness harms the skin, flesh, sinews, and the spleen and stomach.<a id="trans-107p" href="#orig-107p" class="marker">[107p]</a><br/>
It is a wound to the four vital essences. On the surface, it manifests as chills and fever. Within the body, it causes heaviness and sluggishness of the limbs. It is like the phenomenon of internal injury manifesting as emptiness. It is analogous to a lamp accumulating soot and then becoming dark. We have already discussed this in detail. If external evil is strong, a patient may recover initially, but the evil remains unexhausted, leading to a conflict between the evil and the body’s own defense, like oil entering dough, which cannot be removed, resulting in a lifelong illness. <br/>
<br/>
How remarkable this is.<a id="trans-108p" href="#orig-108p" class="marker">[108p]</a><br/>
Those who understand recognize this. Therefore, the practice of using food to treat illness is based on this. It is preferable to nourish with five grains, which saves expense and avoids the problem of abscesses.<br/>
<br/>
Volume One: Various Discourses on Virtue, Medicine, and the Treatment of Disease.<br/>
<br/>
A guest commented: Human fortune is determined by the flow and ebb of time. In the past, heroes’ fortunes were not consistently maintained; when their fortunes arrived, they became generals and officials, employing extraordinary strategies that transcended heaven and earth.<a id="trans-109p" href="#orig-109p" class="marker">[109p]</a><br/>
The difference between the past and the present is like a chasm of heaven. I said, “This is a very clear principle. Please explain it in detail.” I said again, “Why don’t you observe the order of the four seasons? When autumn arrives, all plants wither and fall. When winter comes, they become barren and drop. When spring arrives, they immediately bloom and flourish. And when summer comes, they grow vigorously. This is precisely the sign of following and then not following the time. Moreover, as humans are part of the heavens and earth, they are especially the spirits of all things.”<a id="trans-110p" href="#orig-110p" class="marker">[110p]</a><br/>
The stars and the Milky Way are vast and profound. Their origin lies in itself. Glory and shame, bending and stretching – all are but the fulfillment of human affairs. There is heavenly fate, there is fate derived from spirit, and there is the five fates pertaining to individuals. Heavenly fate concerns time and number. Spirit fate concerns the state. The five fates pertaining to individuals then determine a person’s entire life. It is also known as “jing qi” – the channeling of vital energy. Daytime and nighttime operate according to the rhythm, allowing for the regulation of illness’s progress and retreat.<a id="trans-111p" href="#orig-111p" class="marker">[111p]</a><br/>
The Treatise on Coldness says: It can resolve the Sun’s sickness. From noon to before the third hour. It is also said that sickness manifesting in yang (heat) heals at night, and in yin (cold) it heals in the middle of the day the next day. Furthermore, it is said that smallpox lasts six days; when the six meridians are fully traversed, it should be cured in seven days. This medicine treats sickness by following its particular tendencies, and it begins to heal only when the meridians are exhausted.<a id="trans-112p" href="#orig-112p" class="marker">[112p]</a><br/>
When the skill is lost, what method should be used to remedy it? I say, can a method prevail by means of virtue alone?  It is said, is virtue not faster than medicine? I say, virtue is greater than medicine in its power, yet it has speed. What do you see of this? I say, there was once a noblewoman.<a id="trans-113p" href="#orig-113p" class="marker">[113p]</a><br/>
The horse was urged forward with vigorous whipstrokes. A courtier saw it. He observed that its brow was dark. The law demanded a brutal soldier. Furthermore, the master desired to die. As they journeyed half way, they encountered a stone obstructing the road. He would certainly harm a person. He immediately dismounted to remove the stone and return. Then the courtier saw it again. Its face had already turned a rosy hue. It was not merely alive, and the master desired wealth and honor. The courtier pulled the horse, startled, and inquired about the matter.<a id="trans-114p" href="#orig-114p" class="marker">[114p]</a><br/>
He said, “I just saw you depart. Your color was dark. Surely the commander despised death. You have now returned in triumph, not only not dead, but also a master of wealth and honor. There is no great sage who could have turned back the heavens in an instant.” Then he told him, “This is saving oneself by saving others. The rest, like Sun Chu’s burying of the snake or Pei Jin’s returning with his captured men, are examples of failure.”<a id="trans-115p" href="#orig-115p" class="marker">[115p]</a><br/>
All can turn misfortune into good fortune. Walking along dangerous paths is like traversing a gentle slope. Recorded in ancient texts. Clearly demonstrable. Surely this is like seeking a remedy and accelerating its effect. The guest then meekly departed. Volume One, All Discussions, Treatise on Pulse, The Wise Man resided at Zi Yang Mountain last year. He used the Tai Su pulse to discern people’s wealth, status, poverty, and longevity. Upon arriving this month, no one sought his diagnosis. Upon inquiry, they explained that they chose auspicious times to seek his consultation. In reality, they were deceiving him. They secretly sought out laborers and servants within the city.<a id="trans-116p" href="#orig-116p" class="marker">[116p]</a><br/>
He inquired into his background, which was spent in the households of gentlemen. He had frequently visited and become familiar with them. Though his work was somewhat expensive, he did not argue about the cost. His skill was already well-known. The fees were heavy, and he ran about constantly, with his followers closely following. Today he refuses to cooperate, so he instructs him to come tomorrow. Tomorrow he refuses to cooperate, so he instructs him to come the next day. Eventually, there will be no more disagreements. People universally praise his extraordinary talent; they are bewildered and fall into his skill.<a id="trans-117p" href="#orig-117p" class="marker">[117p]</a><br/>
Below thousands of gold were not counted in a month. The author thought that Master Tao’s internal meridian theory did not record it. Indeed, it was so. It merely approximated the diagnosis based on the pulse, and then estimated the outcome. A slow pulse and a long pulse indicated longevity; a rapid pulse and a thin pulse indicated premature death. A clear pulse with spirit indicated value; a turbid pulse without spirit indicated worthlessness. One could not predict whether a year or month would bring gain or loss of fortune. The author had observed many people in Hangzhou, and recommended the gentleman.<a id="trans-118p" href="#orig-118p" class="marker">[118p]</a><br/>
Then, though deceived, one did not abandon it. Hua Gui, like the Minister Zhu Mu-sin. Ding Song-sin was the Magistrate. Both possessed the Six Yin pulse. Qing Yao, like the official Jin Tie-chen. Sang Chun-yuan, the two Inspectors. Li Mei-sin, the Word Repository. Shou Kao, like Zhao Zhong-fu, the Elder. Lu Dian-qing, Wang Liang-fu, and their predecessors—all possessed the Six Yang pulse. Only Lu Dian-wu possessed the Six Yin pulse. The majority of those with prosperous conditions were Six Yin; those with clear conditions were predominantly Six Yang. In the spring of the second month. The Director of the Same Good Hall invited examination.<a id="trans-119p" href="#orig-119p" class="marker">[119p]</a><br/>
Master Min Zhang was seated. He examined the patient’s pulse. I, being unversed in facial diagnosis, pressed and then said, “This is undoubtedly a person blessed with abundant fortune and virtue.” The onlookers were astonished. They wondered how I could know this. It must be a pulse of the concentrated essence of the Earth’s feminine energies. Master Min Zhang did not notice his laughter. Those skilled in the art recognize wealth, prosperity, poverty, illness, longevity, and death. When they determine a person’s birth year, they possess a clear understanding beforehand, which is not something I dare to fully comprehend. Master Xulin said that it must have a special method.<a id="trans-120p" href="#orig-120p" class="marker">[120p]</a><br/>
I, using my methods, must inevitably be as it is. From the transmission of the world, there has been the theory of the Great Primordial Pulse. It is only through discerning the swift and slow, the light and dark, the calm and agitated, the present and absent. One possesses spirit, the other lacks it. It discerns the extreme and the limited, life and death. The art is a mere patching and forcing together. I take these names and titles, applied to all the scholars of the world, as a trick and a deception, a display of cunning and strangeness. The entire nation acts as if mad. With a calm mind and a cold eye, one can penetrate its hidden schemes, revealing them as if painted with brush and ink.<a id="trans-121p" href="#orig-121p" class="marker">[121p]</a><br/>
The course is not within the reach of any skillful hand.<br/>
<br/>
Volume One, All Discussions<br/>
<br/>
On the matter of pulses, some are reliable, some are not.<br/>
<br/>
The method of the four diagnoses.<br/>
<br/>
The pulse is the most difficult. Yet, it is also the most reliable.<br/>
<br/>
It is imperative to thoroughly investigate the vital energy at the opening of the mouth.<br/>
<br/>
And to seek the Four Pillars and Twelve Branches.<br/>
<br/>
To connect them to the twelve original sources.<br/>
<br/>
To reach the three hundred sixty-five vital points.<br/>
<br/>
The three hundred sixty-five meridians.<a id="trans-122p" href="#orig-122p" class="marker">[122p]</a><br/>
When one attends to the spring’s strings, the summer’s hooks, the autumn’s hair, and the winter’s covering, one will surely obtain them. Some say, “Just as you say.” “Life and death are determined by this.” They mean that this is a decisive matter. I say, “How difficult is this?” Deepness causes cold within; lightness causes heat on the surface; a faint pulse indicates lost blood; true essence is incurable. All of these are things to be relied upon. Another guest says, “What is this vulgar practice?”<a id="trans-123p" href="#orig-123p" class="marker">[123p]</a><br/>
Whether it matters or not, there are contemporaries who call venerable ancients and seek counsel from them. One must fulfill one’s outdoor duties. Often, one cannot decide life and death within a few days. Is there no time for the pulse to be relied upon? I say, this is not so. It is like prolonged overwork leading to illness; the pulse loses its spirit, and then suddenly returns to clarity. Commonly, this is called a return of the sun. The pulse signs exhibit a change, and in fact, it is the effect of the lamp running out and then being rekindled. If one had previously sought the advice of a physician, how could it be that one would not know?<a id="trans-124p" href="#orig-124p" class="marker">[124p]</a><br/>
This ancient man invariably consulted the signs of vision, hearing, and questioning. To the point of extreme pain, he became paralyzed. The pulse was fine and heavy. Fever and sweating raged. The limbs were cold and the pulse lay low. The female attendant’s menstruation ceased, resulting in a dry and exhausted blood. It resembled the pulse of a fetus. It was influenced by evil spirits. The pulse was invariably repeatedly examined. Furthermore, he possessed a normal, distinct pulse. The Yin pulse reversed the Yang, and the Yang pulse reversed the Yin. If not fully informed of his normal constitution.<a id="trans-125p" href="#orig-125p" class="marker">[125p]</a><br/>
Though one diligently attends to every detail, it is impossible to know the diagnosis immediately upon the initial examination. Generally, one should discern the pulse and palpate the body, and then know. If one does not discern the pulse, one must meticulously examine the body, not missing even the slightest detail. Sometimes people offer opinions as if they are certain.<br/>

Reply to He Mianqing’s Letter of Respectful Service. Supplement to the Treatise on Dangerous Illnesses – Blood Poisoning, Asthma, and Critical Cases – by Li.<br/>
<br/>
The humble monk’s careful transcription. A slight understanding of the Way of Medicine, relying on a small foundation. Therefore, we humbly offer our deference to the great scholars and gentlemen, earnestly consulting them.<a id="trans-126p" href="#orig-126p" class="marker">[126p]</a><br/>
The monk’s resources were utterly exhausted. He merely wished to emulate the subtle assistance of fine soil’s trickle to that effect. It was that he habitually, after failing to gain insight from the writings of Huangdi and Qibo, could not properly investigate hidden mysteries and, in treating illnesses, acted carelessly. This was not merely a failure of responsibility, but a failure of himself. After attaining enlightenment, the monk harbored compassion and would never hastily fill in deficiencies; whenever he encountered a difficult and perplexing illness, he labored tirelessly day and night.<a id="trans-127p" href="#orig-127p" class="marker">[127p]</a><br/>
One must carefully examine the reasons for its susceptibility to illness. Specifically, the emptiness or fullness of the organs, the regularity or imbalance of the pulse, the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the medicines taken, and so on.  It must be examined in detail, one by one. Only then can one prudently select the prescriptions. Now, the jade body of the esteemed vessel is disrupted. Three years have passed, with phlegm accumulating above and blood stagnating below, deeply rooted. Medicine cannot alleviate the dizziness and confusion; it fears it will not achieve its effect.<a id="trans-128p" href="#orig-128p" class="marker">[128p]</a><br/>
Now, regarding the true matter, let it be known for the record. Every human being possesses but one body. It absorbs the essence of water and grain. The internal organs receive vitality and blood through the twelve meridians. This reaches all orifices and channels within the limbs and body. And each possesses its own specific function, centering on the heart. The lungs are like a covering of jade. Their position is highest. Beneath the leaves of the lungs are openings to receive the air of all the organs. Below the heart, there is the liver on the left and the lungs on the right.<a id="trans-129p" href="#orig-129p" class="marker">[129p]</a><br/>
Regarding a change of one unit upward and one unit downward, it is that which governs this rise and fall. The power also resides in the spleen and kidneys. Therefore, the human relies on the kidneys as the root of the innate. The stomach absorbs grains and all six internal organs; all receive air through the stomach. Consequently, the stomach is considered the foundation of the acquired. When grains enter the stomach, they are heated and stirred by the spleen’s yang, clear substances become fluids, and turbid substances become excrement. Their essence is transformed and ascends first to the lungs.<a id="trans-130p" href="#orig-130p" class="marker">[130p]</a><br/>
Below, the blood is poured and offered according to the heart, transformed into red, and becomes blood. It originates from the great network of the stomach flowing into the channels and regulators (chong ren). The channels and regulators are truly the blood sea. And furthermore, they govern the liver. Therefore, it is said that the liver governs the stored blood. Ultimately, the stored blood does not reside in the liver, but rather in the two channels and regulators. The blood of men circulates throughout the body. The blood of women is stored in the channels and regulators, and it ceases after one month, without failing to fulfill its appointed time. This is called the Moon’s Trust.<a id="trans-131p" href="#orig-131p" class="marker">[131p]</a><br/>
After the production had occurred, the moisture rising from the stomach did not revert to blood. Instead, the converging and regulating channels (qi-channels) were activated. Specifically, the great acupressure points of the stomach connected to the two breasts. Therefore, the milk flow during the menstrual period did not arrive. This meaning is exceedingly clear. Currently, examining the illness of a noblewoman, it begins with wind-heat and eruptions. The wind-heat first attacks the lungs, then transmits to the stomach, causing eruptions due to the stagnation of wind-heat and the excessive heat within the lungs and stomach, damaging the blood essence, which then manifests on the skin.<a id="trans-132p" href="#orig-132p" class="marker">[132p]</a><br/>
Then it is a rash. Blood heat overflows internally. Then it is epistaxis. This is the reason for the rash and subsequent bleeding. Rash and bleeding. The root has no two distinct causes for the rash. External heat accumulates and stagnates within. Then it is bleeding. Liver and stomach have heat. Body fluids are heated and refined. Then phlegm is generated. Therefore, air rises and phlegm also rises. Air is just fire. Fire and primordial energy cannot be separated.<a id="trans-133p" href="#orig-133p" class="marker">[133p]</a><br/>
The evil fire advances by a fraction. The righteous energy retreats by a fraction. When the evil fire is fully saturated, the righteous energy declines and diminishes day by day. The meridians of the body are everywhere filled with phlegm. It mixes directly with the blood essence and becomes one. Therefore, when above, the energy is urgent and phlegm is blocked; when below, the blood essence swells and fills the ears. Or, it is said that the evil fire has reached its peak in this manner. Fire can transform food; therefore, it should be easy to nourish. It is said that the evil heat does not kill grain.<a id="trans-134p" href="#orig-134p" class="marker">[134p]</a><br/>
The patient should not eat and become full. This illness fluctuates with cold and heat. The pulse is exceedingly deficient. The voice has already become hoarse. And the face and spirit appear as if filled with rage. It is said this is not due to phlegm and fire congestion, but rather a sign of the phlegm pulse being exceedingly deficient. What method did Master Wu determine? It is beyond argument. Only the root has been injured. Various evils cling and take hold. Just as a general governs an army.<a id="trans-135p" href="#orig-135p" class="marker">[135p]</a><br/>
The trail of the bandits spread throughout the mountains and fields. The isolated fortress lost its reinforcements. It was as if a mass of boulders had fallen. Supplies were coming from all directions. There was no assistance. Yet the emperor sat calmly in his hall, discussing the Three Chapters of Great Learning with the soldiers. Although the principles were sound, they were not sufficient to counter the situation. It is clear that this illness is caused by phlegm and qi obstructing the meridians, and blood stagnation and distention of the abdomen. Its origin is gradual, and certainly not the result of a single day or a short period.<a id="trans-136p" href="#orig-136p" class="marker">[136p]</a><br/>
Many should command the finest troops, and this will confer the power of inevitable victory. I do not believe this. Examine the methods of ancient rulers in treating phlegm—establish a standard method. Frequently employ drugs from the lower regions, and test the use of costmary; whether it is effective or not, and seek wise counsel.  Regarding phlegm obstruction, blood蠱 (蠱 refers to a dangerous, often magical, practice), what cases are unsuitable? (Shung-ch&#39;o P&#39;ing) Hsü Sung-ch&#39;o said.<a id="trans-137p" href="#orig-137p" class="marker">[137p]</a><br/>
He surveyed all works. He possessed a foundation of learning of great depth. Therefore, he could consistently return to the root of things. He drew forth knowledge from within. His understanding of illness stemmed from extensive study. His recognition of pulse was due to numerous examinations. His comprehension of medicine arose from repeated use. Thus, his discussion of phlegm did not adhere rigidly to the teachings of Yu Shi, but he developed his own insights. From the ancients, he drew his knowledge. He argued that dysentery was primarily characterized by flow, not dryness. When the river was broken, the pillar flowed within. He thoroughly discussed moxibustion and acupuncture.<a id="trans-138p" href="#orig-138p" class="marker">[138p]</a><br/>
I practiced fumigation and thin plasters, employing each method according to one’s own understanding. Adapting to the times, I did not follow the established patterns of my predecessors. I resided with a monk named Hu Lin in his hermitage for several months, merging my practice with his. Many living people were treated beneath his fingers. He possessed a particularly humble and gentle nature, holding himself with the modesty of a valley. Each day he received visits from physicians, and upon returning, he would meticulously examine and correct my diagnoses. They were exceedingly harmonious. Upon departing, I felt a profound sense of melancholy.<a id="trans-139p" href="#orig-139p" class="marker">[139p]</a><br/>
Because he begged for poems to bid farewell. He composed two lines in strict rhythm. It is like the imprint of a giant’s claw, so called it. <br/>
<br/>
There is a monk who is most suitable to hold my arm. Especially when he is a clear and brilliant jade, at the time of the clear stream and moon. He has long resided in the South Sea’s forests and springs, and deeply knows the West Lake’s winds and moon. He understands the profound knowledge of Zikuan, and the young scholar, Lingsu, is ashamed to linger. <br/>
<br/>
I especially delight in being able to transmit the methods of Yuanhua. He uses a golden needle to instruct the world, and to explain it. <br/>
<br/>
The lamp of my heart shines brightly, like the lotus flower suspended in the air, illuminating the confused people of the world and all of the great and myriad realms. I study the Way, and now simply try it.<a id="trans-140p" href="#orig-140p" class="marker">[140p]</a><br/>
Escape from monastic life has been based on medical transmission since ancient times. Her name was not recorded as Empress Xu. She was in good health and her breath flowed freely, like before Confucius and Mencius. <br/>

My old body is now ashamed not to be broken.  The sound of a bronze bell, when struck, is now a weary, reddish-purple.<br/>

Scroll Mid-Autumn, Case of the Zheng Family’s Asthma, a Treatment that Proved Effective.<br/>
<br/>
The Zheng family’s Zheng, a young boy of seven years old, suffered from asthma. His pulse was solid in all aspects, with knots forming on both sides of his throat. Blue veins protruded like writing brushes, and he emitted sounds resembling cattle and horses. This was due to a mixed diet of fruits and grains, with phlegm and turbidity obstructing the channels.<a id="trans-141p" href="#orig-141p" class="marker">[141p]</a><br/>
I began to use Su Zixian’s formula for descending dampness, modifying it as needed. I took six to seven courses. It was ineffective. I thought the illness was serious, and the medicine was too light. I then used Su Zixian’s essence of willow bark, taking it from the *Yi Bian* formula. I increased the dosage and continued taking it for three courses.<br/>
<br/>
The bluish veins disappeared, and the pulse became smooth and soft. The rattling sound ceased. In all cases of illness, even when using medicine, if the dosage is insufficient, it is not effective.<a id="trans-142p" href="#orig-142p" class="marker">[142p]</a><br/>
The medicine is no good for it; it is often ineffective.<br/>
Volume Thirteen, Case 2<br/>
Treatment of a Case of a Female Chen Family Suffering from Sudden Collapse Due to Excessive Gasping<br/>
<br/>
A female of the Chen family, approximately forty years old, suffered from excessive gasping, unable to rest propped up against a wall and unable to lie down. I examined her. Her complexion was bright and radiant. Her cheeks were flushed. There was no fetal pulse on her tongue. Her pulse was large and empty in the floating part, and fine as spider silk in the sinking part. I searched for it as if she had vanished. I told her daughter, “This is a very dangerous condition.”<a id="trans-143p" href="#orig-143p" class="marker">[143p]</a><br/>
Cannot be treated. Repeatedly sought methods. Then, with great effort, a medical case was written: Yin deficiency below, Yang excess above. The face displays Yang coloration. The pulse lacks roots; the true vital energy is waning; if a large sweat were to emerge, yin and yang would immediately separate. Temporarily, a two-ingredient formula of Dragon Bone Powder and Oysters was prescribed. He departed, politely declining to continue. Another physician would invariably say it was acceptable; he prescribed a rotating formula with powdered ocher stones.<a id="trans-144p" href="#orig-144p" class="marker">[144p]</a><br/>
He died upon swallowing. This is recorded in Volume 13 of the *Zhenjing*. Regarding the treatment of false dyspnea, it was prescribed by Wang of Guangdong. Returning from Hangzhou, he unexpectedly felt a slight illness. He then added anger, and consequently experienced labored breathing, reversed breathing, and was unable to lie down. I observed and treated his symptoms by chance, summoning a physician for consultation. His breathing was extremely rapid. The sounds of his breathing were not continuous. His face was glistening with blackness, with an oily sheen. His pulse was elevated in the superficial and deep regions, with a large empty space in the middle.<a id="trans-145p" href="#orig-145p" class="marker">[145p]</a><br/>
The condition is subtle and weak. It does not connect with each other. I said, “This is a case of excess and deficiency, with more deficiency than excess. Do not use pills and powders incorrectly.” <br/>
<br/>
Two doses of Long Mu Tang (Dragon and Oyster Soup) were administered, and the patient was at peace.<br/>
<br/>
Case from Volume 13 of the Medical Manuscript.<br/>
<br/>
Chen Xinliang, a physician from Penglai Gong in Ningbo, treated a patient with a deficiency-related asthma, cough, reverse aggravation, and without phlegm. The patient had weak pulse and spontaneous sweating. The condition belonged to deficiency of the lungs and spleen. The treatment included Western Ginseng, Winter Crab, Summer Grass, Sichuan Pearl, Qing Salt-preserved Ginger, Honeycomb Glue, Red Date, Apricot Seeds, Peach Leaf, Thorny Oyster, and others. Earth and metal generate each other.<a id="trans-146p" href="#orig-146p" class="marker">[146p]</a><br/>
He recovered after taking more than twenty doses.<br/>
<br/>
Case 1: Treatment of Wind Heat, Cough, and Shortness of Breath – Yinyin Jifen<br/>
<br/>
Yinyin Jifen was fond of strong alcoholic beverages. In the fifth year of the Kaiyuan reign (1126 AD), he contracted wind heat with a cough and shortness of breath, accompanied by slight cold and fever. His pulse was floating and numerous. This was due to a wind-related invasion affecting the lungs, which had lost their ability to maintain clear and orderly function. He treated it with a combination of peach bark, wild cherry seed, foxtail grass, hydrangea, licorice root, star anise, and other herbs, and recovery occurred after a single dose.<br/>
<br/>
Case 2: Treatment of Cold and Damp with Cough and Shortness of Breath – Guo<br/>
<br/>
Guo was approximately forty-four years old and habitually had phlegm in his body. Whenever the weather was severe, his illness would manifest.<a id="trans-147p" href="#orig-147p" class="marker">[147p]</a><br/>
He coughed and wheezed, unable to lie down. For more than ten years, he had suffered greatly. In the winter of the year of the Shen of the Golden Age, he fell ill due to the cold and the illness recurred. He felt a cold sensation on his back, like a large palm. He heard a sound like a water hen in his throat. His pulse at the cun (a Chinese unit of measurement) was floating and tense. He took two doses of the Second Young Dragon Soup, and immediately felt better. Until winter, he cauterized the Lung俞, Da Zhui, and Zhong Wan acupoints. Afterwards, he never relapsed. Whenever he encountered evil influences that deeply obstructed the internal organs, when illness manifested, it was effective.<a id="trans-148p" href="#orig-148p" class="marker">[148p]</a><br/>
Using acupuncture surely can eliminate the root cause. Sadly, many people do not believe it, resulting in lifelong illnesses. It is a lamentable situation.<br/>
<br/>
Case from Volume 13 of the *Zhen Yan* (Standard Classics of Acupuncture).<br/>
<br/>
A woman surnamed Ma suffered from shortness of breath and vomiting in the summer, with perspiration on her head and an inability to eat. This had persisted for two days. She then sought my examination. Her pulse was large and rapid, and her tongue presented a pale center with red margins. I diagnosed it as excessive heat and dampness obstructing the lungs and stomach, disrupting the regulation and descending of qi, causing shortness of breath. I prescribed a decoction of葶苈子 (ting lie zi – *Fritillaria bulbosa*), 知母 (zhi mu – *Angelica sinensis*), 南花粉 (nan hua fen – *Prunus armeniaca* seeds),枇杷叶 (pi pa ye – *Pyrus pyrifolia* leaves), 川连 (chuan lian – *Ligusticum chuanxiong*), and treated her to complete recovery.<a id="trans-149p" href="#orig-149p" class="marker">[149p]</a><br/>
Guo Shao-weng was forty or so years old. He engaged in the rice trade, and was greatly fatigued. In the autumn of the Jiu Year, he suffered from wind and cough. He consulted me. His pulse was floating, the superficial pulse was excessively deficient and large. The san jue (pulse point on the middle of the arm) was constricted and small. He perspired profusely and continuously. I said, “This is a case of wind. But the pulse reveals an extreme deficiency. The san jue pulse responds with an abnormally large size.”<a id="trans-150p" href="#orig-150p" class="marker">[150p]</a><br/>
If administered remedies that disperse pathogenic factors, perspiration will inevitably flow without ceasing. The external pathogenic factors will ascend and float excessively. The treatment should focus on nourishing and strengthening the body. With two prescriptions, *Yu Ping Feng San*, the condition will subside.<br/>
<br/>
Volume 12 of *Zhen Yan* Case of Yuan Xu’s Treatment of Heat Fever.<br/>
<br/>
Xu Yuan, approximately forty-four years old, possessed a fundamentally weak constitution and was afflicted by heat fever. His pulse was exceedingly weak and rapid. The tongue was pale and irregular, the eyes red, and his face flushed with heat. He had profuse sweating, staring directly with blurred vision.<a id="trans-151p" href="#orig-151p" class="marker">[151p]</a><br/>
I said, the illness originates from excessive heat and not penetrating deeply enough. The true vital energy is exhausted to the extreme, and the treatment is exceedingly difficult. First, one must consolidate its vital energy. Immediately use the Four Invigorating Herbs with Ginseng Decoction. Supplement with Dragon Bone, Oysters, Chole and Children’s Urine. Use loach water one bowl as a decoction base. Boil intensely, then cool it down. Gradually administer it. Take one dose for a short time. Constrict the mouth, calm the spirit, and allow the eyes to move freely.<a id="trans-152p" href="#orig-152p" class="marker">[152p]</a><br/>
But he was severely thirsty and his tongue was parched. The heat symptoms had fully manifested. He was given watermelon to eat. His spirit suddenly felt refreshed. It was pleasant. The next day he examined him again. The pulse was slightly restrained, with a strong but diminished root, reduced by one or two degrees. He prescribed Bamboo Leaf Stone Soup. He took two courses. He was able to rise and speak, but only felt a slight weariness and ate little. This was due to the depletion of stomach fluid.<a id="trans-153p" href="#orig-153p" class="marker">[153p]</a><br/>
The embers had not yet cooled. Therefore, sand ginseng, wheat winter aconite, stone ginseng, chi mu (motherwort), ginseng licorice, silver flower, young broad bean, and others were used to nourish the lungs and stomach, thereby clearing the remaining heat. Several courses brought immediate relief.<br/>
<br/>
Xui Hwai (Xu Hui River) was accustomed to employ this method. It was difficult to use effectively. This is because the illness manifests like the White Tiger; one uses the White Tiger to address it, and its use inevitably leads to death. The key to discerning it lies in the palpation of the pulse – its emptiness or fullness.<br/>
<br/>
Case from Volume 12 of the Medical Manuscript.<br/>
<br/>
The son of Weng (翁) suffered from heat poisoning manifesting with fever and sores on the lips. He was twelve years old, in the year Bingxu (丙戌) of the summer.<a id="trans-154p" href="#orig-154p" class="marker">[154p]</a><br/>
Within, a foul and murky stagnation. The body’s heat was like burning coals. For more than ten days it remained unremitting. Then he summoned me to examine him. His pulse was exceedingly full and great. His complexion was yellowed and aged. His lips were dry and his tongue black. The tongue was abnormally short. The roots of his teeth were connected to the tongue. Fresh blood overflowed from his mouth. He drank incessantly. His eyes were fixed straight ahead. He could not utter a sound. I observed that his vital energy was dissipated.<a id="trans-155p" href="#orig-155p" class="marker">[155p]</a><br/>
I said, “The illness has reached this point. What can be done?” The patient had repeatedly requested prescriptions. I considered burning wood and using water and straw as fuel, but ultimately it proved useless. Therefore, I devised a large dosage of bitter, sweet, cold-natured herbs. Then I mixed watermelon juice, mugwort juice, golden elixir, silver flower dew, sugarcane juice, lotus root juice, each one a quarter of a pint. All were placed in a cauldron. And I added powdered limestone two ounces, *Lycium barbarum* five *qian* (parts), fresh bamboo leaves a handful, black mountain栀 (Chinese privet) four *qian*,<a id="trans-156p" href="#orig-156p" class="marker">[156p]</a><br/>
Fine sand one Liang.<br/>
Horn of rhinoceros one Qian.<br/>
Ground powder.<br/>
Horn of antelope three Qian.<br/>
Western Ginseng.<br/>
Fresh Hydrangea.<br/>
Mulberry Bark.<br/>
Each three Qian.<br/>
Talcum powder four Qian.<br/>
Instructed him to cook them all in a large jar.<br/>
Remove the residue.<br/>
Mix in all the juices.<br/>
Wait for it to cool and drink at will.<a id="trans-157p" href="#orig-157p" class="marker">[157p]</a><br/>
The watermelon may be eaten freely. The first day’s medicine was finished. A single slice of watermelon was taken. The second day was re-examined. The diagnosis was as before. Stone plaster was added again, two ounces. The third day was re-examined. The heat remained undiminished. A slight moistness was seen on the face, and the swelling was large and very painful. I said, “It is an attack of heat and poison.”<a id="trans-158p" href="#orig-158p" class="marker">[158p]</a><br/>
They gathered here. Internally, there was fear of festering and penetrating. Applying medicine was of no effect. They continued to use the previous method. They added two ounces of plaster. To four ounces. Then they added yuan san (yuan san), mai dong (mai dong), and sheng ye (sheng ye). After five doses, the fever subsided. They then administered black arrow-ash (hei yi) in several pieces. All symptoms were relieved. The stomach also gradually began to move.<br/>
<br/>
This illness was turned from danger to safety, entirely reliant on the patient’s unwavering belief, and I was able to exhaust my skills.<a id="trans-159p" href="#orig-159p" class="marker">[159p]</a><br/>
Otherwise, it would be difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Case 1, Volume 13, Chapter 2<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Yi treated a case of damp-heat affecting Yang Ming, resulting in a knot in the food, followed by a recurrence of healing.<br/>
<br/>
This was Zhang Yi’s treatment of a patient from Ningbo, Zhang Yi, who suffered from a damp-heat condition. He had been ill for more than ten days with a fever. His flesh had completely fallen away, leaving only the skin and bones disordered. His right foot was unable to move, and there was a protruding mass on the right side of his lower abdomen, about the size of a fist, causing extreme pain. His bowel movements had ceased for fourteen or fifteen days.  I Fang and Hu Bao-Weng then sought my treatment.<a id="trans-160p" href="#orig-160p" class="marker">[160p]</a><br/>
I told him that my abdominal pain and swelling were sudden. Kim Keik administered a treatment to subdue it. A medicinal powder was prescribed as the primary remedy. Now this herb is rarely found. He obtained it on the third day. Then he inquired about my method of taking it. I said, “Is it truly so?” We must go together to examine it. The medicine for dizziness and confusion should not be suspended; let us go to Zhang’s house together.<br/>
<br/>
I saw Zhang lying on the bedclothes. Zhang’s eyes rolled, and he shook his head. His illness was severe and manifested in countless ways. His complexion was pale and withered.<a id="trans-161p" href="#orig-161p" class="marker">[161p]</a><br/>
The pulse is exceedingly firm. The abdominal muscles are hard as a stone. The measuring stick is increasingly strong. Sometimes it is momentarily quick. I said, “This is not a case of acute enteritus. The pulse in acute enteritus is full and abundant. When it has become pus, the pulse is tense and firm. When it has not yet become pus, the pulse is full and abundant. Now the floating part is not full and abundant, but the sunken part is large. The abdominal muscles are protruding, and the eyes show red streaks. This is a case of damp-heat invasion.”<a id="trans-162p" href="#orig-162p" class="marker">[162p]</a><br/>
Bound in Yang Ming. Masses beside the abdomen. These were the accumulation of dryness and impaction. Only after passing a bowel movement once did the masses dissolve, and the pain in the abdomen ceased. The patient asked, “I had discussed with the previous physician the method of treatment. The physician said that when a person has reached the extreme of deficiency, one must not recklessly discharge it. I thought that the swelling and pain were due to an inability to relieve it. Now, this gentleman is using a method of treatment; I am willing to die for it.”<a id="trans-163p" href="#orig-163p" class="marker">[163p]</a><br/>
I wrote a prescription for Great Bear [referring to a medicinal formula]. Five *qīn* of large yellow pills. Three *qīn* of gunpowder. Those observing were bewildered and unable to decide. I said, “If you do not descend, you will surely die. Descending may offer a chance of recovery.” Then I prepared it and placed it upon a table. The patient’s illness and pain suddenly intensified, he drank it all in one gulp. There was a loud sound within his abdomen. He then staggered to the latrine. First, he expelled balls of hardened feces, about three or four. Subsequently, he had watery diarrhea, emptying half a barrel.<a id="trans-164p" href="#orig-164p" class="marker">[164p]</a><br/>
A mass disappeared. The next day, the limbs extended and were painful, and all were lost. He then administered two doses of the Advance Liquid Soup. Afterwards, the fever subsided first. Then he used the Benefit Stomach Soup method. The stomach and appetite gradually grew stronger. The fluid increased and became moist. I traveled to the upper county. The patient wished to eat mutton. He asked a physician in the nearby area, saying, “After illness, the stomach qi should recover. Mutton is the most effective for nourishing the stomach.” Consequently, the patient was completely certain and indulged in a lavish meal.<a id="trans-165p" href="#orig-165p" class="marker">[165p]</a><br/>
The next day, the body did not exhibit fever. The tongue’s coating was again thick and turbid. Yet the pulse was still numerous. He then summoned me. I said, “The damp-heat syndrome is now recovering.” It is essential to prioritize caution regarding the taste. How could this be hazy? He then brought with him flatulence powder mixed with Shenqu, charred jujubes, and barley sprouts, with the dosage decreasing in order. This was because the stomach’s energy had been long deficient, unable to withstand consumption. After taking two courses, he became at ease. This illness initially manifested due to a failure in clear cleansing; once the heat had developed after a long period, it was evident.<a id="trans-166p" href="#orig-166p" class="marker">[166p]</a><br/>
The body fluids have dried up and run out. The stomach’s earth is dry and fierce. Yet still, he continued to take the medicine for nourishing the vital energy. It only increased its dryness. Eventually, it formed hardened feces, with lumps protruding from the sides of his abdomen, and the muscles and veins could not be moistened. His feet became stiff and painful. The physician mistakenly diagnosed it as a contracted foot-intestine sore. He erroneously administered a decoction of bitter herbs, attacking the blood without success. What then shall be done? A gentleman studies medical texts, and he dreads to formulate his own prescriptions.<a id="trans-167p" href="#orig-167p" class="marker">[167p]</a><br/>
The medicine was not suited to the illness. Life and death rested in one’s hands. How regrettable.<br/>
Roll 3, Case 2<br/>
Concerning the death of a woman surnamed Zhang after she took cooling medicine for a summer heat illness.<br/>
The woman surnamed Zhang. It was half a month after she had given birth during the height of summer. She suffered from summer heat illness, with a parched mouth, red eyes, fever, and a flushed face and body. Summer sores appeared in profusion, leaving no space for inspection.  Yu summoned her for examination. Her pulse was one breath seven or eight times, with a feeling of floating and sinking that was excessively slippery. He prescribed a soup of leafy bamboo and stone.<a id="trans-168p" href="#orig-168p" class="marker">[168p]</a><br/>
The wife of the elder studied at the village school. She followed the advice of keeping the body warm after childbirth. I observed this. She used one *liang* (a unit of weight) of plaster to treat the fever. I understood her intention, and used the method of the Golden Medical Chest with a large pill made of bamboo strips. This method was detailed, and because the plaster was heavy in substance and clear in its energy, it was most effective at cooling the heat. However, it was not the method that the master practitioner used. I then consulted another physician, adapting his general formula, and completed the case within three days.<a id="trans-169p" href="#orig-169p" class="marker">[169p]</a><br/>
Hearing after death, fresh blood issues from the mouth and nostrils. Not ending the day, the flesh has rotted. Volume thirteen of the case records. Zhou Zi Zhang’s family members, Wu’s clan, suffered from damp heat. It lingered for several months. Every afternoon, a slight chill would first appear, followed by fever. The fever subsided only at dawn. Chest tightness, refusal to eat. The former physicians stubbornly prescribed small preparations of *Chai Hu* (Bupleurum) with various additions and subtractions, resulting in worsening of the illness. Upon my examination, I declared, “The pulse indicates malaria.”<a id="trans-170p" href="#orig-170p" class="marker">[170p]</a><br/>
The pulse is slack and moist at the small, degree. This is due to the spleen and stomach being weak and damp obstructing the root of the disease. Consequently, a damp heat arises. One should treat this from the dual dominion of the Yin and Yang meridians. Allow the body to accumulate thick phlegm of a rich quality. The exterior is swollen, the hollow interior is guarded by Yin. The emptiness of the interior is itself a manifestation of Yin deficiency. Therefore, the treatment differs from ordinary damp heat. If one uses wind-expelling herbs, the excess Yin fire will ascend and dominate. Promote thinness to benefit water, and allow the Yin essence to escape. Focus on dryness and dampness.<a id="trans-171p" href="#orig-171p" class="marker">[171p]</a><br/>
To exhaust the true dampness, one must use purely tonics. Conversely, this action promotes phlegm, dampness, and obstructs its ascent. It is necessary to moisten and harmonize the dryness. Soft and firm forces must be combined. Only then can it be effective. Subsequently, one uses prepared formulas consisting of Saposhu (Corydalis root), Stoneflower (Houttuynia cordata), Maca Persicaria, Field Hemp Seed, Oysters, Chinese Bellflower, Bamboo Bark, Cinnamon, Job’s Tears, Yellow Kvassul, and other herbs for several courses of treatment. The symptoms of damp heat were relieved, and the stomach gradually opened. I then traveled to Shanggong (Shangu), where I consulted with a physician from the surrounding area. He continued to use Saposhu, and after taking one course, the chills and fever returned. He then invited me, and I continued to follow the previous method.<a id="trans-172p" href="#orig-172p" class="marker">[172p]</a><br/>
With hemp leaves, Sichuan copal, *ling*, *ze*, and young grain sprouts. They intermingled and adjusted it, and it was cured. Ye Tian Shi said: *Chai Hu* moves the liver yin. It cannot be used for non-true malaria.  Volume Thirteen of the *Internal Medicine* case: A female of the Luo family suffered from summer heat, nausea, chest and abdominal distension, and pain, which was verified.  She lived in Ning County, a female of the Luo family.  At the age of coming of age, in the transition between summer and autumn, she suffered from abdominal distension, pain, nausea, chest tightness, and vomiting.  She was unable to take in water and grains, with cold limbs and sweating. Her body was hot and thirsty.  The pulse was taken on the floating parts, and the count was heavy.<a id="trans-173p" href="#orig-173p" class="marker">[173p]</a><br/>
He tightened the string of the zither with force. This was due to summer heat and dampness. He inhaled deeply through his mouth and nostrils, directing the breath towards the center. He proceeded directly to the middle channel, entering the essence of the Yang limb of the liver. Consequently, he experienced pain in his chest and abdomen, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He then prescribed a decoction consisting of one cup each of lotus root, water chestnuts, watermelon juice, radix lægen (a type of root), and five measures each of ginger, cnidium palmatum (枳实), wood fragrance (木香), and betel nut (槟榔). After taking it for seven days, the illness subsided.<br/>
<br/>
Recorded in the Middle Jīn casebook.<br/>
<br/>
The case of a female Wu clan afflicted with a sudden attack of heat closure and convulsions.<br/>
<br/>
She was the granddaughter-in-law of Wu Lin Wu Zi, a venerable elder. She suffered from a fever caused by the accumulation of damp heat in the winter. Suddenly, she experienced convulsions and a feeling of heat closure.<a id="trans-174p" href="#orig-174p" class="marker">[174p]</a><br/>
He stared blankly, his mind vacant. The elderly man urgently summoned Yu. I went to examine him. His pulse was heavy, several times strong. It was certainly caused by excessive heat and internal stagnation. He could not use acupuncture at night. He urgently stabbed ten points with a needle, and then stimulated the qichichu (curved pool) and renhe (person-in-the-middle) acupoints. Then he used stone ngozi (Ligusticum chuanxiong), yujin (Scutellaria baicalensis), zhubi (Bamboo Leaf), shiguo (Calcium Carbonate), huangxiang (Angelica Sinensis), and pine nuts. First, he adjusted Zixuedan (Purple Snow Powder) at a dosage of eight parts. Then he examined him again in the morning. The symptoms were as before. Then he used acupuncture, inserting the needle into the yindan (Indentation) point.<a id="trans-175p" href="#orig-175p" class="marker">[175p]</a><br/>
Along the pierced passages of the two rate valleys. Opening the eyes, one knows pain. I immediately told him it was without harm. For the treatment of convulsions and sudden fits, and the sudden illness of young children, it depends entirely on these acupuncture points. Whether the needle penetrates and obtains vital energy, or does not, and whether the sensation of pain at the top of the head is present or absent, determines life and death. If the needle inserted into the 印堂 (Yìn táng – 印堂 point) produces an empty sensation beneath it, like inserting a needle into tofu, and if the pain is not felt at the top of the head,<a id="trans-176p" href="#orig-176p" class="marker">[176p]</a><br/>
Though the jade may flatten, it is still impossible to regenerate. This illness has been treated with acupuncture. Now he can speak. However, the prescription still maintains the qualities of fragrant and promoting the opening of the channels and stimulating the spirit. Several courses of treatment cured it.<br/>
<br/>
Volume 4, Case 3<br/>
<br/>
A woman’s mother, suffering from dampness and cold invading the body, causing nausea, constipation, and abdominal pain, was treated and found effective.<br/>
<br/>
The woman’s mother was fifty or so years old. She traveled to Hangzhou via Stone Gate during the middle of autumn, experiencing fatigue from travel, exposure to wind and dampness, and slight chills and fever. She had chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain, refusing to eat.<a id="trans-177p" href="#orig-177p" class="marker">[177p]</a><br/>
He Yang Ming experienced dampness and stagnation transforming into fire. The vital fluid could not nourish the channels. The intestines and stomach failed in their conduction. Treatment was administered by opening and harmonizing the meridians. The prescription consisted of dried angelica root, apricot kernel, forsythia root, star anise, mugwort, nutmeg, cinnamon, gardenia fruit, unripe wild jujube, prepared bitter orange, powdered myristica, added white honey. A single dose cured all symptoms.  From the case of a child suffering from summer heat and dampness causing food stagnation and diarrhea.  The Gu family’s experience with treating such cases in July, where a child suffered from summer heat and dampness causing food stagnation and diarrhea.  Of the many cases of summer diarrhea among children during the summer and autumn, approximately seven or eight were due to summer heat and dampness causing food stagnation. I have consistently applied this method.<a id="trans-178p" href="#orig-178p" class="marker">[178p]</a><br/>
All must follow the example of hand-picked herbs. For those whose spleen is deficient and harmed by cold fruits and vegetables, it is not appropriate to use them. Volume thirteen, case number one. Chen surname child, four years old, Wei He, suffered diarrhea, persisting for nearly a month, refusing to eat rice or grains for six or seven days. He experienced abdominal pain, thirst, and uncontrollable diarrhea, with fever and cough. He was on the verge of developing a sluggish spleen and heat obstructing the channels. The patient was critically ill, and he summoned me to examine him.<a id="trans-179p" href="#orig-179p" class="marker">[179p]</a><br/>
Fang Yong Qing Shu Hua Ji Zhi Pin. With fresh lotus leaves, fresh reed root, Huang Lian, Huang Qin, Mu Xiang juice, Gan Cao, Ji Hong, Lai Zengzi, Jina Jin, Cheqian Zi, Yi Yuan San, etc. Take two courses and all symptoms are greatly reduced. Excrete once a day twice. The stomach receives An Gu. Playful laughter resumed as usual. However, after eating, the symptoms remained complete, not digested. Therefore, a formula for nourishing the spleen and stomach was changed, such as Western Ginseng, lotus leaf stems,茯苓,焦甘草, 橘皮, 木香, 冬术,炒扁豆, 石斛, 谷芽, 泽泻, 五谷虫, etc. Nourishing the stomach yin and raising the spleen yang, treated for several courses, all symptoms were completely cured. After several days, the heat evil recurred, diarrhea reappeared.<a id="trans-180p" href="#orig-180p" class="marker">[180p]</a><br/>
The patient experienced a fever, accompanied by a labored cough. He was treated specifically for summer heat and external pathogenic invasion. He used a prescription consisting of willow bark, mulber root, adzuki bean flowers, fragrant atractyla, barley sprouts, ziziphus jujuba root, and golden shaft. After several courses of treatment, the illness was cured. Case recorded in Volume 13 of the Medical Case Records. A dangerous illness of severe summer heat, diarrhea, and toxin accumulation. The patient came from Shanghai and contracted a summer heat invasion. His body was hot as if burning, with severe thirst and copious urination. His pulse was heavy, numerous, and markedly full. The tongue presented with a yellow, thick, and greasy coating. The diarrhea occurred hundreds of times daily.<a id="trans-181p" href="#orig-181p" class="marker">[181p]</a><br/>
A single grain of rice did not enter. The illness was already gravely deteriorating. He consulted me. I diagnosed it as heat, toxin, and dampness, manifesting in the Yangming. Fortunately, a large purge was administered. If the evil had not found a way out, the intestines would have rotted and the stomach would have perished; he would already have been dead. The illness was grave, but not hopeless. However, it was not to be treated with sharp-cutting drugs. Instead, I followed the methods suggested by Ms. Yu, using five portions of yellow knotweed and four portions of yellow chrysanthemum.<a id="trans-182p" href="#orig-182p" class="marker">[182p]</a><br/>
Three measures of sweet flag. Five measures of silver flowers, one handful of fresh bamboo leaves, one leaf of fresh lotus. Five measures of prepared greater yellow. Three measures of powdered pearl. Four measures of floral powder. Made into a decoction and taken orally. A single dose causes a great reduction in symptoms. The following day, only a few doses are excreted. The feverish state is also relieved. The original formula is then resumed, omitting the greater yellow and powdered pearl. Thus, for dangerous conditions, two doses are given, and the fever and diarrhea cease.<a id="trans-183p" href="#orig-183p" class="marker">[183p]</a><br/>
She thereafter sustained herself on millet gruel. The illness subsided without the need for my medicine.<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 13 of the Case Records.<br/>
<br/>
A case of summer heat illness caused by the misadministration of warm, drying medicines resulted in severe symptoms, and a successful remedy was found.<br/>
<br/>
Ningbo raised its standards. Hunan,弁勇. A patient suffering from summer heat illness. Initially, he experienced mild chills. He quickly developed a fever. The local physicians favored the use of warm medicines, such as cinnamon, chuanwu (wu萸), atractylodes, and kongpi (浓朴). His body heat was like that of a burning fire, he was thirsty and desired to drink cold water, and his urination ceased entirely. They invited me to examine him.<a id="trans-184p" href="#orig-184p" class="marker">[184p]</a><br/>
The pulse was large and numerous. He said, “This is a fever caused by the excessive consumption of warm, dry substances. Therefore, I used White Tiger Soup with mulber ry root, pollen, snow lotus, silver flower, fresh bamboo shoot, golden juice, and smooth stone. The medicine was prepared by boiling and then cooled. A single dose brought about recovery. The next day, he was helped to walk home to his residence.” The patient’s fever was very slight. His urine had already flowed. The pulse was now calm. His tongue and lips were moist. All symptoms had recovered.<a id="trans-185p" href="#orig-185p" class="marker">[185p]</a><br/>
Then, he adjusted the prescription by increasing and decreasing the ingredients. He removed gold juice, *zhi mu* (knowledge root), and fresh *hu* (grain). He added Western ginseng, lotus leaf, and Sichuan *hu*. <br/>
<br/>
He took two courses of treatment and was cured. It was because he had neglected to consider the differences in the body’s constitution, and to discern the strength or weakness of the pulse and symptoms, and to recognize the effects of six external pathogenic invasions.<br/>
<br/>
Volume 12 of the *Zhongjian* case.<br/>
<br/>
Detailed account of the causes of a severe illness suffered by a Mr. Yu due to misdiagnosis of a cough. Mr. Yu, over fifty years old, suffered from dampness internally manifesting as wind-cold. Initially, he felt a slight sensation of wind and cold in the early winter.<a id="trans-186p" href="#orig-186p" class="marker">[186p]</a><br/>
A cough due to wind excess. The southern physician, Yan, treated it. He heavily employed ephedra, dried ginger, and gypsum in three preparations, taken continuously for six to seven courses. The abdomen became severely distended. He then changed the treatment to commercial hemp, sweet flag, and greater celosia. Initially, after taking it, it seemed somewhat relieved. However, after a long time, the distension became even worse. He invited me to examine him on the New Year’s Eve. His pulse was detached from the root; his complexion was dusky and stagnant; his voice was hoarse from the phlegm he coughed up.<a id="trans-187p" href="#orig-187p" class="marker">[187p]</a><br/>
The appearance was like rotten flesh. Urine trickled, but it did not pass. The original condition was completely gone. One mistake led to another, and there was no remedy to save it. Truly, this is killing with a blade. It was observed at the initial onset of the illness. It was originally a minor ailment. One or two doses of apricot-based sedative powder were administered, and it was immediately effective. Then, heavy, warm medicines were used, resulting in the intrusion of wind, cold, and dampness, combining internally and externally.<a id="trans-188p" href="#orig-188p" class="marker">[188p]</a><br/>
And it swells. The illness originates not from water, but from hardening it. It causes the channels to close, and urine ceases to flow. In this perilous state, even divine power cannot be applied. “It is said that one does not die from the illness, but dies from the treatment.” Who can say this is not so? Alas.<br/>
<br/>
Volume Thirteen, Case 2 – Eight Prescriptions for the Treatment of Dysentery.<br/>
<br/>
Autumn of the Year Bing (176). Dysentery was prevalent in Dinghai.<a id="trans-189p" href="#orig-189p" class="marker">[189p]</a><br/>
There was a man who used Lei Gong San with脐灸. It revived him; one hundred and one times. The patient was a woman of the Bao family, afflicted about the thirty-fifth day of the year. She also suffered from this ailment. She purged five or six times, and immediately her eye sockets sank and large flesh protruded. She was severely thirsty, demanding to be given drink repeatedly. She drank and vomited frequently, exhibiting agitation and fluctuating symptoms. Her limbs were numb, with a pulse lying low. Her tongue was slightly white and dry, with a small red spot on its tip. I said, “This is an evil caused by summer heat and filth.”<a id="trans-190p" href="#orig-190p" class="marker">[190p]</a><br/>
He lay in ambush at the root of the pulse. It was the heat of a fever. Do not mistake it for a cold and treat it with cold remedies. Instead, cauterize with Lei Gong San and similar medicines. This is because the external evil originates from the intake of noxious substances through the mouth and nose, directly heading towards the center. He lay in ambush at the root of the pulse; the organs and meridians were blocked. Therefore, the upper manifested as vomiting and the lower as diarrhea, as if the body had been severed in two. This is what is meant by “the evil resides at the root of the pulse.”<a id="trans-191p" href="#orig-191p" class="marker">[191p]</a><br/>
The marrow is the fat of the human body. It is near the stomach and intestines, and communicates with the meridians. When noxious heat and stagnation obstruct the channels within, the meridians and blood vessels on the outside become constricted and cold. Therefore, the limbs are cold, and the pulse is weak, while the internal heat is falsely perceived as cold. One must first use the method of needle pressing and flowing to open the external gates and orifices. The head, face, ying-men, and jinjin, as well as the shu-men, yang-men, zhong-chong, and shao-chong on the hands, should be treated in this way.<a id="trans-192p" href="#orig-192p" class="marker">[192p]</a><br/>
All had punctured the skin. They used it to discharge the poison. They administered a soup pill containing fragrant herbs to open the orifices and dispel toxins. The ingredients included yellow knotweed, yellow chrysanthemum, star anise, mugwort, spikenard, fragrant bloodgrass, honeysuckle, bark of the rattan palm, prepared citrus peel, chewan, lulo, sap of the gourd, silkworm’s excrement, etc. They took a dose of Zhui Xue Dan. One dose resulted in vomiting and diarrhea, and the limbs became relaxed with restored pulse. All illnesses were relieved.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, Mrs. Ding, an old woman, suffered from this ailment. Her pulse was moist, deficient, and excessively large. They prescribed a medicine containing star anise, yellow chrysanthemum, yellow knotweed, silphium, rattan palm bark, lulo, prepared citrus peel, foxtail millet, and smooth stone. This was due to a summer evil accompanied by dampness, and her pulse had not yet settled. Her limbs had not yet become pale.<a id="trans-193p" href="#orig-193p" class="marker">[193p]</a><br/>
The former administration of law differed somewhat. Furthermore, the young man named Xiang had been twelve years old. His pulse was cold, his tongue white and without thirst, his eyes straight with a dullness of spirit. This was due to the internal invasion of heat and the external influence of cold, coupled with a deficiency in the fundamental essence. If, however, fragrant substances were abruptly used to open and invigorate, it would inevitably lead to the violent expulsion of vital energy. Then, ginseng, atractylodes, white peony,藿香 (huāoxiāng –藿香), and winter savory were employed. Nine measures of Japanese sulfur, wood apricot, and others were also used, initially to strengthen the spleen and consolidate the essence, followed by purging and resolving the fever.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a><br/>
And the limbs were warm, the pulse revived. The following day, red spots appeared beside the tongue and at the tip. The eyes were red, and the mouth was parched. This indicated that the original Yang had returned. The external cold had subsided, and internal heat now manifested. The prescription was changed to include prepared knowledge root, gypsum, bamboo leaves, pollen, melon pulp, fragrant stick, spikenard, greater lovage, prepared ginger, honeysuckle, talc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Taking two courses of medicine, the pulse gradually became regular. Only a feeling of extreme fatigue remained. The appetite was diminished. This indicated that the excess heat had not yet cleared. The stomach and duodenal vessels were not in harmony. A light and clear prescription was used to nourish the stomach yin. Such included American ginseng, rattan cane, bamboo fiber, lotus leaf, snow ear fungus, pyeong ling, mung bean sprouts, watermelon rind, black plum, Indian trumpet flower, melon pulp, green bean pods. These were used in the formula.<a id="trans-195p" href="#orig-195p" class="marker">[195p]</a><br/>
Adjusting several prescriptions brought about a cure. Furthermore, there was a woman. Her tongue presented a grayish, smooth coating. Her limbs were cold, and her pulse was sunken. Her complexion was bluish-grey and bleak. She did not desire to drink, yet drank. Her body was also calm. This is undoubtedly a case of excessive internal coldness. Using the *Fuzi Li Zhong Tang* (附子理中汤) with added *huo Xiang* (藿香), *bian Xia* (半夏), and *chen Pi* (陈皮) resulted in a cure. <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, there was another person. Their abdominal pain was like a twisting, and they experienced vomiting upwards and diarrhea downwards.<a id="trans-196p" href="#orig-196p" class="marker">[196p]</a><br/>
The face was flushed red. The tongue coating was aged yellow. The tip of the tongue was red and protruding. The limbs were cold, the pulse lying low. The patient was agitated, like madness. The drink did not quench thirst. There was vomiting and diarrhea. The discharge had a sour and fetid odor, and could not be approached. This was the poison of a hot and polluted environment, deeply penetrating the interior. A treatment was given combining the cooling method for the diaphragm with gypsum and silver flowers, to transform the internal heat and poison. A single dose resulted in vomiting and diarrhea, and the tongue coating turned a fresh red.<a id="trans-197p" href="#orig-197p" class="marker">[197p]</a><br/>
A slight purple hue. The pulse emerged from Hongda. This is a fever turning into blood deficiency. With a bamboo leaf, plaster,生地 (she di), 丹皮 (dan pi), yinhua (silver flower), and shanzhi (mountain栀) as a single prescription, it was cured. Such cases are not commonly seen. It is necessary to carefully examine the symptoms before using the prescription. If there is even a slight error, disaster will inevitably follow.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, a woman experienced convulsions and coldness in her limbs. When the muscles contracted, her abdomen and feet were hard. Her pain was unbearable. Examining her, there was no pulse in the two upper meridians. Pressing firmly until it reached the bone.<a id="trans-198p" href="#orig-198p" class="marker">[198p]</a><br/>
As fine as spider silk. However, its movements were firm and resisted pressure. First, with a three-pronged needle, it was pricked in the hollow, causing a small amount of black blood to flow. When forcefully squeezed, the blood flow was minimal. Then, the needle was inserted into Kunlun and Chenshan. After the needle was finished, the leg tendons felt loose. Then, powdered salt, safflower, and white lead were heated and applied to the hollow and the soles of the feet. Subsequently, three-pronged needles, *e-shu* (莪术), *gui-xu* (归须), red flowers, almonds, silkworm cocoons, staghorn, dragon blood, white bone moss, Chinese parsley, pawpaw, and wood apricot were used.<a id="trans-199p" href="#orig-199p" class="marker">[199p]</a><br/>
The patient’s symptoms lasted for a short period of time. The muscles ceased to spasm. However, vomiting and diarrhea also ceased. The next day, he changed the prescriptions to include silk gourd, rhizoma Lysimachiae, peach seed, bamboo floss, Glycyrrhiza uralensis root, smooth stone powder, silkworm sand, pawpaw, prickly ash, Coptis rhizome, and gardenia bark – all aiming to clear heat and moistness and promote the circulation of blood vessels. Subsequently, he added American ginseng, polygonatum multiflorum, dendrobium officinale, tangerine peel, bamboo floss, Glycyrrhiza uralensis root, silk gourd, and茯苓 (fu ling) – adjusting the prescriptions for ten days before the patient recovered.<br/>
<br/>
A farmer named Shi, approximately forty years old, occasionally visited the city and suffered from dry heaves. His abdomen felt as though it were being twisted, without vomiting or diarrhea. He collapsed to the ground, with cold limbs and a pulse that sank. Two doses of Liusi Sheng (a formula) were ineffective.<a id="trans-200p" href="#orig-200p" class="marker">[200p]</a><br/>
He hastily prescribed a solitary victory powder. He administered it by dissolving it in hot wine. It still proved ineffective. The lips and face were pale and ghastly. The tip of the nose was cold. The pain intensified. The situation was extremely grave. He was forced to use a horse-chestnut soup with the external medicine department. Sichuan lovage and frost were used in a ratio of five parts. He took half of it. There was a great commotion in his abdomen, and then he evacuated stool. The stench was foul and unbearable. The pain then lessened somewhat. He was carried to the residence of relatives within the city walls to rest.<a id="trans-201p" href="#orig-201p" class="marker">[201p]</a><br/>
The next day, he was able to proceed at a slow pace and return home.<br/>
<br/>
Volume 13, Case 2<br/>
<br/>
Three cures for typhoid fever.<br/>
<br/>
Zhang Heng, the magistrate of Ding, owned three oil shops and was a close friend. His home was in Ci Bei Township, a distance of over three hundred miles. Travel was by boat and raft, requiring three days. Because of his limb’s cold pulse, a thick white coating on his tongue, a greasy appearance to his skin, and a glazed, vacant stare, he refused to accept treatment. Other physicians treated him with ginseng, mugwort, ginger, Japanese sulfur, wu ya, artemisia, grass, and fo-tah.<a id="trans-202p" href="#orig-202p" class="marker">[202p]</a><br/>
The next day, the limbs gradually grew warm. The eyes could move and turn. The others considered it a celebration. I said, “This is a return of light and reflection.” My ashes would easily be extinguished. It was better to quickly order them to return home, as I had said. But he died on the way. Alas.<br/>
<br/>
Ximen General’s surname was Wu. He was over ninety years old and also suffered from this illness. His eyes were glazed over and he was in a daze.<a id="trans-203p" href="#orig-203p" class="marker">[203p]</a><br/>
He was strong of body, with a tense jaw. His breath came in and out with difficulty. The tongue’s coating was smooth and pale red. The center of his tongue was bluish. I said, “This is due to an external invasion of wind-evil. Wind and phlegm obstruct the channels, and the vital energy is deficient.” He inquired that he had suffered a wind paralysis previously. He refused to treat it. He died within two days.<br/>
<br/>
Another man from a distant county resided outside the south gate of the city.<a id="trans-204p" href="#orig-204p" class="marker">[204p]</a><br/>
He spent his days stirring mud. He extended Yu to go and examine him. The tongue’s coating resembled the liver of a pig from the previous night. The face was pale, and the spirit was confused. Pain in the side was irritable. The pulse was cold in the limbs. He refused to treat him. He died at midday. These three symptoms were precisely the “great evil entering the organs” as described in the *Nei Jing*. They were a sign of imminent death. This was recorded to demonstrate incurable illnesses, which were beyond the power of human skill.<a id="trans-205p" href="#orig-205p" class="marker">[205p]</a><br/>
The treatment could not be established. Morning and evening, one would die. Therefore, the common people called it the phenomenon of east-west sickness. I have cured more than fifty people, yet only three of them ultimately died, and both of those were cases that could not be treated. The rest, like the many wives of the Bao family, were the most numerous. Therefore, I did not record them. Because there were similarities and differences among them.<br/>
<br/>
Volume 13, Case 13, Examination of Paralysis due to Stroke.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Shenzai was forty-odd years old. He habitually drank wine. In the middle of the day, he suddenly dropped his cup to the ground. His family quickly helped him back to bed and summoned me to examine him.<a id="trans-206p" href="#orig-206p" class="marker">[206p]</a><br/>
The eyes were glazed, the spirit dimmed. The face was red as cinnabar. The teeth were tightly closed. The breath sounded like thunder. Phlegm and saliva rose upwards. The pulse was thick, large, and numerous. Immediately, a needle was inserted into baihui and mingmen. The cheeks were massaged. The teeth were forcibly opened, and precious pearls were continuously administered until three were consumed. Only then was he treated with white antler, fragrant spikenard, calcareous stone, turmeric, mandarin orange peel, hookvine, mulberry leaves, silkworm pupa, chrysanthemum, peppermint, croton, and scorpion venom. He recovered slightly by the eighth hour, and was re-examined the following day.<a id="trans-207p" href="#orig-207p" class="marker">[207p]</a><br/>
The pulse remained numerous and large. Following the example of the *Zhi* (寿) formula and the *Ji* (资) formula for the *Tang* (解) solution. After taking three courses, he began to speak. The tongue remained hard. The stool was not passable. The pulse remained copious and large. A prescription of *Fangfeng* (防风) was administered, five chi per dose. Further, three chi of *Daguang* (大黄) were added. The soup was boiled and taken three times a day until the next day when the stool became passable. The two lower limbs were weak and powerless. The two hands had pain in all the joints, resembling the symptoms of the White Tiger Wind Syndrome.<a id="trans-208p" href="#orig-208p" class="marker">[208p]</a><br/>
Now, following the ancient methods of acupuncture, moxibustion, steaming, massage, fumigation, boiling, decoction, pills, and all related techniques were applied. Recovery began after a period of adjustment for over a month. Volume Three, Medical Case, Ding Shi’s Brother – Treatment of Wind-Heat Sore Throat. Ding Ming Song’s Elder Brother, the third generation. He suffered from wind-heat sore throat. Initially, he felt a slight chill. Immediately, he developed fever. For three days, a small lump appeared on both sides of the throat. If something was obstructed. By the fifth or sixth day, pus formed, causing severe pain. The sores then appeared on both sides of the throat. He had previously sought treatment from another physician, using cooling, dry, and light remedies.<a id="trans-209p" href="#orig-209p" class="marker">[209p]</a><br/>
The pulse at the cun, guan, and wei ducts was floating. The two feet were slack and weak. I diagnosed the condition as wind heat rising. It must be treated primarily to clear heat and detoxify. Fortunately, the front was correct. The pulse was clear and refreshing. Though the condition was serious, it could be stabilized. Do not seek rapid results. One risks straying from the correct path. Listen carefully to the advice of Master Song. Therefore, he used antler of the ibex, gypsum, mu-li, silver flowers, dormant silkworm, peppermint, paper mulberry bark, indigo, and gardenia to clear wind heat in the upper portion of the body. If the stool was constipated, he used da Huang, qin, lian, yuan ming powder to promote bowel movement.<a id="trans-210p" href="#orig-210p" class="marker">[210p]</a><br/>
He prescribed drugs to reduce swelling, detoxify, and draw out pus. For more than twenty days. The pus did not entirely rot. The patient grew increasingly weary and feeble. The entire family was filled with anxiety and confusion. They then used drugs such as ground snails to treat it externally, aiming to extract the poison from the outside. I urgently ordered the bandages to be removed, washing the wound with a sweet grass decoction. It was truly because the pus had already decayed that there was no need to draw it out externally. It merely allowed the poisonous vapors to disperse, prolonging the difficulty of recovery. Until finally, it occurred to me that the pus was entirely gone, and the pulse was also calm.<a id="trans-211p" href="#orig-211p" class="marker">[211p]</a><br/>
And the swelling and pain persisted. Fang Xin’s judgment was correct. Then he used six *qian* (small measures) of raw licorice. One *zan* (small cupful) of raw green beans. The mixture was simmered in water and then augmented with a medicine for purging toxins and cooling the fire, nourishing the Yin. The next day, the swelling and pain worsened. Afterwards, he used a medicine for nourishing the stomach and calming the mind. He adjusted the prescriptions as he entered and exited. It took several months before he recovered.<br/>
<br/>
Volume 12, Case 3, Examination of the Gold Surname’s Throat Affliction – Diagnosis of Reversed Pulse and Ultimately Unsuccessful Treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Gold Surname’s son. Twenty years old. He suffered from a paralytic throat affliction. Initially, he experienced slight chills. Subsequently, he developed fever and confusion.<a id="trans-212p" href="#orig-212p" class="marker">[212p]</a><br/>
My hands were clenched tightly. For six or seven days. The physician prescribed Pu Ji, a disinfectant drink. It was ineffective. Afterwards, I heard of a case of throat disease suffered by a Ding family member, which I cured. He came to me for examination. The pulse in all six parts of my body was sluggish and weak. It was soft and powerless. The number of days was indistinct. Consciousness was unclear. The throat was swollen and attached to the upper part. Its color was bright red. The tongue’s coating was red and bristly.<a id="trans-213p" href="#orig-213p" class="marker">[213p]</a><br/>
I say, this illness is exceedingly grave. I fear it will be difficult to achieve a cure. I shall, however, treat it according to the nature of the disease. Some may object to my words, but I do not foresee such occurrences. The pulse itself is not the disease to be treated; the symptoms of closure and detachment are already evident. Therefore, I prescribe a large dosage to clear heat and detoxify the body. Such as rhinoceros horn, antelope horn, forsythia, gardenia, plaster of Paris, honeysuckle, sweet white wood, mulberr root, golden elixir, manchineel, yuan san, dan pi, zi xue dan, and zhi bao dan. The changes will be apparent upon entry. After taking two doses, the fever will abate, and the mind and consciousness will become somewhat clearer, with convulsions ceasing.<a id="trans-214p" href="#orig-214p" class="marker">[214p]</a><br/>
The crowd regarded it as a fortunate event. The pulse remained agitated and unclear. The two chi were deficient and loose. I said, “Although the external signs are grievous, the pulse offers no turning point. One must obtain heat to purify the spirit and clear the mind. The pulse should become tranquil, clear to the count. Even if the skin is cold, weary, and uncomfortable, there is no cause for worry.” Then, following the previous method, they entered and exited alternately. The next day, the fever returned with a clear spirit and confusion.<a id="trans-215p" href="#orig-215p" class="marker">[215p]</a><br/>
Between his bosom issued white spots. I said, “White hairs have appeared, but they have not penetrated deeply. Sweat is flowing, yet the heat does not diminish. This is clearly a dangerous weather condition.” I departed, saying that I could not treat the illness. The patient exerted great effort in seeking my prescriptions. I saw that he believed them without question. I could only strive with all my strength, and the dosage increased. Until the thirteenth day, white spots appeared all over his body. His tongue was dry, his lips were parched, bleeding at the gaps between his teeth, and his entire face was flushed.<a id="trans-216p" href="#orig-216p" class="marker">[216p]</a><br/>
The agitation was intense and frenzied. Sweat poured out as if from a bath. The heat grew increasingly fierce. The pulse was strong and rapid. I said, “The moment of life and death is tonight. If the heat recedes, there will be a chance of survival. But if it continues as it is, Hua Fuan will surely be beyond saving.” The next day the heat did not abate. The jaws were clenched tightly, and he died on the seventh day.<a id="trans-217p" href="#orig-217p" class="marker">[217p]</a><br/>
Or he asked me: This illness is still light in its initial appearance. You, Master He, immediately spoke of the fatal hour. The case was that of the Ding family; it has already become dangerous. You, Master He, insisted that it was without peril. I said, “Seeing it in the pulse, though the external symptoms are perilous, the pulse remains smooth. Thus, it can be guarded against.” External symptoms may be light, but the pulse has become reversed, and it ultimately does not heal. Like the case of the Ding family.<a id="trans-218p" href="#orig-218p" class="marker">[218p]</a><br/>
The wind and fire were ascending. The pulse was floating repeatedly. Floating indicated wind, and repeated floating indicated fire. The syndrome was determined by the pulse’s correspondence. When the floating and repeated floating were clearly distinct, the syndrome belonged to wind and fire. The pulse at the wrist, the size of a cun, was not swollen until the repeated floating, and was vague and unclear. Two chi were deficient and weak. This was the deficiency of the essence and blood of the Shao Yin. Wind heat invaded from the mouth and nose, settling in the lower burner.<a id="trans-219p" href="#orig-219p" class="marker">[219p]</a><br/>
Gaining the heat of Yang above. The three funnels move as fire. Internally and externally filled. Unable to reach the original source. Resulting in a closed and released condition. Especially concerning those with weak and deficient conditions originating in the lower burner. Yang of the Lesser Yin is not stored. Essence and blood are internally deficient. Liver Yang is inherently strong, resulting in convulsions and spasms. Ye Tian Shi’s commentary on warmth and heat is exceedingly detailed. Based on the principles of the Inner Canon, it states that in winter, essence is not stored.<a id="trans-220p" href="#orig-220p" class="marker">[220p]</a><br/>
When the season turns to warmth, illness manifests as heat. The pulse of this illness is distinct. It is most to be avoided when the sensation is blurred and indistinct. *Nei Jing* says, “When blurred, it is like a surging spring.” The illness proceeds with a discolored appearance. This illness, known as the *Inner Canon*, is called ‘yin-yang intersection.’ *Su Wen* comments on fevered illnesses, stating that the Emperor has a fever that breaks out and then returns, with a restless and rapid pulse that does not diminish with sweat. The madman cannot eat. What is the name of this illness? Qi Bo replies, “The name of this illness is ‘yin-yang intersection.’”<a id="trans-221p" href="#orig-221p" class="marker">[221p]</a><br/>
Those who engage with others die. Those who sweat are born from grain. Grain is born from essence. Now, evil spirits contend within the bones and flesh, causing sweat, and when the evil spirits prevail, essence is consumed, and it becomes hot. This heat is the essence. Now, when sweat appears and is immediately followed by heat, the essence is defeated and cannot be nourished. Those who remain ill are those who can stand and then collapse. Furthermore, the Heat Discourse states: sweat appears and the pulse remains agitated; this is death. Now it is clear that this is due to not overcoming the illness. The madman is, in fact, a loss of spirit.<a id="trans-222p" href="#orig-222p" class="marker">[222p]</a><br/>
Those who lose their spirit die. I have now seen three cases of death. Though they may recover, they will inevitably die. This refers to the internal texts which contain such statements. It is not possible to cure them with methods that bring life.<br/>

Volume 14, Case of the Throat and Pharynx, Observations on the Treatment of Red-Flag Manchus. Thirty or so days after the onset. They suffered from throat and pharyngeal swelling and pain that had not yet resolved. For three days, they could not swallow liquids. Their pulse was strong and rapid. First, they punctured the Du Mai and Shang Jian acupoints to bleed. Immediately after, they felt relief in the throat. They were then treated with the “Kuan Hai San” (loosening phlegm powder) and “Shi Xian San” (thinning phlegm powder).<a id="trans-223p" href="#orig-223p" class="marker">[223p]</a><br/>
Expelled from the throat a viscous phlegm into a bowl. It could be swallowed. Then used soap root, burdock root, silkworm chrysalis, angelica root, white atractylodes, peppermint, licorice root, Japanese knotweed, Corydalis root, Atractylodes macrocarpa, indigo, gardenia root, and small-leaved licorice. Administered for seven days and it subsided.<br/>
<br/>
Case from the Medical Records of the Middle Path, Treatment of Wind-Induced Sore Throat.<br/>
<br/>
In winter, he suffered from wind-cough. He mistakenly took hot, external medicines. Consequently, he developed a persistent cough. It lingered and did not improve. Until the second and third months of the following year. Dry cough without phlegm, hoarseness, and a pale, wan appearance. The throat gradually became rotten.<br/>
<br/>
The color was white and not swollen.<a id="trans-224p" href="#orig-224p" class="marker">[224p]</a><br/>
In the sixth month of summer, I ceased to rise from my bed. I then examined the patient, surveying the situation before me. The symptoms were of cold, heat, dampness, and dryness mixed together. The pulse was thin and fine, with a large number of beats. The patient’s body was flushed with heat, and his complexion was alternately red and pale. I said, “The illness is curable in its root, but it has been aggravated by excessive medication. This illness is in its initial stage, belonging to a minor wind-borne ailment, a misadministration of numbness-inducing herbs, and items of the Great Heat and Great Yang.”<a id="trans-225p" href="#orig-225p" class="marker">[225p]</a><br/>
The heat and cold intensified. The Lung Metal was affected by dryness.<br/>
At the time of the spring formula’s rising, the Lesser Yang’s Wood Fire ascended. Therefore, the essence became dry and voiceless, and it was further aided with dry medicines, resulting in a chaotic and violent fire. Treatment should focus on the nourishment of both Metal and Water to aid the Lung’s transformation. However, a quick cure is not desired; if sought, my inadequacy is evident. A formula is used consisting of: Stone Nut, Mulberry Leaf, Sweet Flag, Agaric, Honey-fried Purple Aster, Honey-fried Winter Stelleria, Polygonum, Turtle Myrtle, Green Cuscus, Lac, Bitter Orange, Red Bark, Five Flavors Seed, Thorny Stork’s Bill.<a id="trans-226p" href="#orig-226p" class="marker">[226p]</a><br/>
He took thirty-odd doses. Then he was able to rise from bed. His diet gradually increased. His voice gradually emerged. He then followed with ten-flavor Dihuang Soup, adjusting the formula as needed. After another twenty-odd doses, the ulceration of the throat gradually flattened. Subsequently, he took one hundred doses of Pan-Shen Nourishing Essence Soup, adding agalloch, oyster shell, wood rattan, lily, and other ingredients. After taking one hundred doses, he began to recover.<br/>

Treatment of Poisonous Ulcer and Rotting Throat – A prostitute from Ningbo, over thirty years old, suffering from yellow sores. The external medicine initially brought relief, but the poison accumulated in the throat, causing a prolonged and festering ulcer.<a id="trans-227p" href="#orig-227p" class="marker">[227p]</a><br/>
The tongue was swollen and exhausted. It entered through the nostrils. He took hundreds of cold-damp medicinal doses. Eventually, his complexion became pale, like a withered bone. His voice was hoarse, his skin cold. His lips and tongue were all a dull white. His abdomen was distended and loose. His pulse was deep and fine, like silken threads clinging. He extended his examination to him. I said, “Excessive cold dampness; the spleen and stomach are injured and deficient.”<a id="trans-228p" href="#orig-228p" class="marker">[228p]</a><br/>
The vital energy dissipated. Records of the ascent to the spirits were kept. First, life’s root was preserved. The illness was not discussed. Then, ginseng, chuanxiong (mulberry root), fructus gualing (white atractylos), and yu-shu (licorice root) were used to nourish and strengthen. They were administered in over ten courses. Gradually, signs of recovery appeared. The diet, abdominal distension, and diarrhea were completely cured. Subsequently, ginseng was used to nourish the Rong-ying Soup, which was consumed in five treasures pills to transform the poison. Pearl Yellow Powder was blown into the lungs continuously, always using warm-nourishing medicines with a transforming-poison quality. Within a month, all ailments were cured.<a id="trans-229p" href="#orig-229p" class="marker">[229p]</a><br/>
The bamboo tubes were completely rotten. But the rottenness ceased in the small tongues. They no longer grew. <br/>

Volume Thirteen, Case 2, <br/>
Concerning the Sun Syndrome of Fever, using steaming to induce sweating, and its successful treatment.<br/>
<br/>
One *chai* (a unit of weight) patient was originally strong and robust. He could lift one hundred *jun* (a unit of weight). In the winter month, he contracted the Sun Syndrome of Fever, with chills and no sweating. He had headache and stiff neck, with pain in the pores like a needle prick. His breath was quick and his pulse was tight. I treated him with Ma Huang Tang (Huang Lian Tang) in one dose, and it did not produce sweating. In a second dose, it still did not produce sweating. Then I took a cooking pot and stove from the *pohu* (a type of boat).<a id="trans-230p" href="#orig-230p" class="marker">[230p]</a><br/>
Two pots were set up on either side, front and back. Within each pot, water was placed with medicines of Chinese hornbeam, Sichuan forsythia, and prepared aconite, all of fiery and vigorous nature, and burned. Let them boil. Remove the pot covers. Then burn for half an hour. All windows and doors were made tightly closed, so that the patients’ mouths and nostrils received the steam. After steaming for a long time, profuse, foul-smelling sweat finally appeared. The patient then suddenly seized a fever; this was because the evil had deeply invaded, and the channels and meridians were tightly closed, so the medicines could not bring forth sweat; only the method of steaming proved effective.<a id="trans-231p" href="#orig-231p" class="marker">[231p]</a><br/>
This ancient man’s skill is not my fabricated account. Observing the cases of renowned physicians and their formula explanations, one understands it oneself.<br/>

Chapter Mid-Autumn, Case 1:<br/>
The Liu family’s son, suffering from diarrhea in a critical condition, and the remedy’s efficacy.<br/>
The fourteen-year-old Liu family’s son, living a life of wind and rain, eating little and sleeping outdoors, considering it a habit during the transition between summer and autumn, was weak and deficient in energy, with yellow skin and a swollen abdomen. His mother attributed it to a deficiency. After eating dates for several days, his condition worsened, and his appetite remained closed.<a id="trans-232p" href="#orig-232p" class="marker">[232p]</a><br/>
Pain in the abdomen, diarrhea. However, he still exerted himself to row a boat. Eventually, the diarrhea became uncontrollable, the spirit gate opened, limbs grew cold, pulse sank, eyes were straight, and consciousness faded. Then, I examined him. His tongue was pale and smooth, he did not feel thirsty, and the patient was not agitated. It was definitely due to excessive damp cold of the Taiyin.<a id="trans-233p" href="#orig-233p" class="marker">[233p]</a><br/>
At that time, Wei comforted him. Although the illness was dangerous, it still belonged to a case that could be saved. He provided the Book of Medical Prescriptions with the Li Zhong Tang, using three *qian* (small measures) of live *zi* (a medicinal herb). He instructed the pharmacist to take the medicine with a pinch, and the pharmacist said that using too much *zi* never exceeded one *qian*. He had never seen live *zi* used in three *qian*. He instructed him to return and ask me. I replied, “I have used six or seven *qian* and achieved a successful result. Three *qian* is still a sufficient dose. What is meant by ‘too much’?”<a id="trans-234p" href="#orig-234p" class="marker">[234p]</a><br/>
He resented the excessive treatment. I could not force it. He insisted on a strong decoction.<br/>
<br/>
Her mother was in a state of critical illness. She administered a single dose, hoping for a chance. Then, at the eleventh hour, he took the medicine between the eleventh and twelfth hours. Gradually, he was able to speak and recognize people.<br/>
<br/>
By the time it was the twelfth and first hours, he took a large dose of purgative. His abdomen felt greatly relieved. He was able to move about freely, seeking food when he felt hungry.<a id="trans-235p" href="#orig-235p" class="marker">[235p]</a><br/>
He brought the decoction of Jin Pot Ba to half a measure. The next day he inquired about his condition. He instructed him to resume the original prescription in a single course. It did not relieve his symptoms. He did not take any medicine. Within three days he was able to bear his weight and walk. The crowd considered it extraordinary. They did not know the ancient method of turning the danger into safety was so effective. There was no reason for wonder. However, this case was fortunate because it occurred in a remote, poor area, allowing it to recover quickly. If it had occurred in the household of the wealthy and powerful, many physicians would have been consulted, each holding their own opinion.<a id="trans-236p" href="#orig-236p" class="marker">[236p]</a><br/>
Against multiple obstructions and barriers. It cannot be cured, then. <br/>

A Remedy for a Elderly Woman with Bleeding Dysentery. <br/>
<br/>
She was a woman of an elderly age, residing in Dinghai’s Eastern Mountain. She was a neighbor of the deceased elder’s family. She was over forty years old. She suffered from bleeding dysentery, with dozens of episodes per day, acute diarrhea followed by severe constipation. Rice grains had not been digested for ten days. She had a high fever, excessive thirst, and was in a state of imminent death. She moaned and was close to dying. I treated a similar illness for the elder’s family.<a id="trans-237p" href="#orig-237p" class="marker">[237p]</a><br/>
He sought my company for the purpose of examining my pulse. He measured the pulse at the two passes, noting the strings with a consistent, deep sound. He pressed it, kneading with his fingers. He said, “This is a case of summer fever caused by food stagnation. I prescribed a large dose of yellow knotweed, yellow chrysanthemum, star anise charcoal, honeysuckle charcoal, betel nut, wood fragrance juice, powdered bitter orange, guiwei, red yeast rice, chuanxiong charcoal, earth elm, locust flower, white atractylodes, charred hawthorn.” He then cured it by half. Subsequently, he removed the powdered bitter orange, and added sweet flag, and prescribed a second dose, resulting in complete recovery. His four-year-old grandson also suffered from the same illness.<a id="trans-238p" href="#orig-238p" class="marker">[238p]</a><br/>
But one could eat a little. With the peony decoction, omitting the cinnamomum. Adding lo Han plant, Yi Yuan powder, charred hawthorn, and things like *Wu Gu* insects, it was cured. I treated these three symptoms, turning danger into safety. The public considered it a divine remedy. In reality, it was merely treating the symptoms.<br/>

Volume 12, Case 3, Examination of Jing Xiu Nuns with Wet Heat and Diarrhea – Guo Tongyuan treated the nuns of Jing Xiu Monastery. In autumn, they suffered from diarrhea like the brain of a fish, with pain in the abdomen and flank, with gas descending, and swelling and pain at the anus. It persisted for many months, with yellow faces and thin bodies.<a id="trans-239p" href="#orig-239p" class="marker">[239p]</a><br/>
Within the difficulty, a greater difficulty follows. The pulse is largely deficient and greatly enlarged. I said, “Diarrhea is caused by the stagnation and heat of dampness. The treatment should focus on promoting transformation and draining fluids, using drying aromatics to counter the fire. This is incompatible with the illness, and therefore cannot be cured. Then I added soybean curd, fresh藿香 (huǒ xiāng –藿香), yellow knotweed, yellow gentian, yellow chrysanthemum, *Potentilla fruticosa*, sandalwood, *Citrus japonica*, radish seed, *Symphytum asteriodes*, *Angelica sinensis*, *Foeniculum vulgare*, *Cyperus hexanthera*, white atractylodes, lotus leaf, *Artemisia annua*, *Glycyrrhiza glabra*, talc, etc. Taking two courses of this medicine reduced the illness by half. Then I removed the white atractylodes, soybean curd, and *Symphytum asteriodes*, and added *Dendrobium officinale* and *Psoralea coryanthis*. After four courses, the illness was reduced to seven or eight parts.”<a id="trans-240p" href="#orig-240p" class="marker">[240p]</a><br/>
She recovered with an agent for harmonizing the stomach and resolving dampness.<br/>

Volume Three, Case 3, Treatment of Intestinal Soreness, Verified.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, she visited another elderly nun, aged approximately fifty years. She suffered from abdominal pain, treating it herself with a fever-reducing remedy. Needles and scraping proved ineffective. She then sought my treatment. I examined her, finding the right inguinal pulse forceful. There were floating sensations within her body. She described a hard, resistant area on the right side of her abdomen.<a id="trans-241p" href="#orig-241p" class="marker">[241p]</a><br/>
The right foot cannot be extended. I said, “This is a carbuncle of the large intestine, not a fever.” He was greatly alarmed. I said, “It is of no consequence. A carbuncle in its early stages, if treated correctly, can be cured in ten cases. Greatly to avoid surgical incision, which would corrupt the intestine and break through the membrane; this is not a cure. Instead, we will use silver flowers, angelica root, turmeric, peach seeds, cinnabar, benzoin, calumba, gopher skin, hawthorn pulp, and comfrey.” Taking two doses, pus and blood came out with the feces.<a id="trans-242p" href="#orig-242p" class="marker">[242p]</a><br/>
The stench is foul and unpleasant. The swelling subsided, the limbs extended. The abdomen was not painful. However, diarrhea continued, with purulent and bloody discharge. Further, purging and disinfecting agents were administered, such as silver flowers, Chinese herbaceous root, peach seeds, prepared aconite, safflower, white job root, musk, benzoin, white atractylos, and calamus in several courses, resulting in recovery. The pulse was like a chapter of a book entirely different. One must diligently investigate the root cause. The painful area resisted pressure. Slight swelling was present. It was not due to injury obstructing the blood flow. It was certainly an internal carbuncle. One must pay close attention to the symptoms daily, in order to recognize it.<a id="trans-243p" href="#orig-243p" class="marker">[243p]</a><br/>
Case of the Chen Chu Po Syndrome: A Record of Treatment and Results.<br/>
<br/>
The elder brother of Chen Chu Po, named Shu Xiang, suffered from this illness. He was thirteen years old, and his body was already tall, exceeding twenty years. He began to manifest symptoms at the age of twelve, so his bones lacked strength. Observing how plants easily flourish and grow strong, while their branches remain delicate, reveals the underlying principle. In the spring of the tenth year of the Ding Hai era, he suffered from a cough with copious phlegm, a diminished appetite, and fatigue. His legs were weak and unable to support him when standing, and when his eyes were closed, he would lose semen. He would even have thoughts in his mind during the daytime, and was restless in his dreams at night.<a id="trans-244p" href="#orig-244p" class="marker">[244p]</a><br/>
Now Yan Yu began to treat him. He examined the pulse, noting a tight string on the left side and a deficient, expansive feeling on the right. The two cun marks were two chi long, all deficient and weak with no strength. Yu said, “The illness belongs to the dominance of wood and the deficiency of earth. The kidney energy is not firm, and the heart fire attacks and harms the lung metal. Treatment should first preserve the yin of the lungs and stomach, taking the principle of earth generating metal. Furthermore, the stomach is the foundation of the acquired, and earth can generate all things. It is recorded that…”<a id="trans-245p" href="#orig-245p" class="marker">[245p]</a><br/>
He who nourishes the stomach will prosper. Wait until the vital energy of the stomach gradually strengthens, then use blood and flesh to create living beings. Similar things resonate with each other. Supplement essence and nourish blood. The illness gradually subsides. Therefore, initially, use light and bland items such as mulberry leaves, *Sān Pān* (Sandy Root), *Chá Hú* (Spikenard), cooked *Mài Dōng* (Ophiopogon),枇杷叶 (Loquat Leaves), *Bái Jì Lì* (Barbwire Grass), *Xiān Bàn Xià* (Chinese Wild Grapefruit), *Jú Hóng* (Citrus Sinensis), *Zhú Rú* (Bamboo Starch), *Gǔ Yá* (Crystallized Ginger), *Fú Líng* (Cyperus microstylis), *Fú Shén* (Cyperus rotundus), *Zǐ Wàn* (Aster Nana), *Bǎi Hé* (Lilium martalinum), *Mó Yàn Xiù* (Seed of *Euphrasia microphylla*), *Nǚ Zhēn Zǐ* (Bulbus *Galangal*), *Lián Zǐ* (Lotus Seeds), *Huai Shān* (Chinese Wild Yam), *Qi Shì* (Citrullus colocynthus), *Zǐ Wàn* (Aster Nana), *Bǎi Hé* (Lilium martalinum), *Shū Yǎng* (Herbal Formula for Smoothing Muscles and Meridians), *Zī Xué* (Herbal Formula for Nourishing Blood and Harmonizing the Liver), such as *Guī Qiáo* (Peucedanum praelongum), *Jīn Yīng Zǐ* (Forsythia suspensa), *Chá Hú* (Spikenard), *Shān Yá* (Dioscorea elata), *Shān Yú* (Pyrostegia igniunca), *Xù Dàn* (Paeonia nodiflora), *Dǔ Zhōng* (Paeonia rockii), *Mài Dōng* (Ophiopogon), *Xī Yàng Sēn* (Lonicerae ginseng), *Wǔ Wèi Zǐ* (Five Flavors Seed), *Ā Jiāo* (Red Resin), *Shā Yuán Jì Lì* (Seed of *Euryale ferox*), *Shēn Bèi* (Agaric), *Chén Pí* (Citrus aurantium), *Rén Lú Xiān Fú Shén* (Prepared *Fructus Foetidus* with *Fructus Radix Polygoni latissimi*), *Lóng Gǔ* (Dragon Bone), *Mó Lí* (Oyster Shell), *Qi Shì* (Citrullus colocynthus), *Dān Sēn* (Ephedra Sinica).  Then, administer thirty or more prescriptions.  Subsequently, the phlegm gradually diminishes, the vital energy of the stomach opens, and then use herbs to smooth muscles and meridians and nourish blood and harmonize the liver, such as thirty or more prescriptions.  Urine leakage, nightmares, and other symptoms are all cured.<a id="trans-246p" href="#orig-246p" class="marker">[246p]</a><br/>
But the feet remained without strength. Afterwards, one employed blood and flesh, possessing the quality of feeling. It was compounded into a paste. Like Wu Ju-tong’s method for the root of the month’s paste, five or six *chi* (units of weight) were taken twice a day, morning and evening. Until the year of the Wu character spring. The steps became as usual. <br/>
<br/>
The strength was stronger than before. This demonstrates the efficacy of restorative medicines. <br/>

<br/>
Li Li-weng, nearing sixty years of age, suffered from phlegm and fire, having treated it for many years.<a id="trans-247p" href="#orig-247p" class="marker">[247p]</a><br/>
Cannot remove the root. Last year I used light and clear medicines to treat it and it was cured. This spring, after the evening meal was finished, I was playing with my grandsons. Suddenly I felt numbness in the right half of my body, followed by paralysis of the tongue and then the whole body. I quickly summoned a physician. The pulse in the right side was strong and rapid in all three sections, while the pulse in the left side was firm and smooth in the Guan channel. I diagnosed it as caused by the rising of phlegm and fire obstructing the meridians. I first injected bleeding points at the bi-pool, sho-shang, and other locations. Then I prescribed a medicine consisting of roe of the antelope, mulberry leaves, fishing vine, orange peel, Sichuan tortoise shell, fragrant sparganium, croton tectorius, nutmeg, valerian, spirit wood powder, spirit wood, bamboo skin, and bamboo sap. This cured it.<a id="trans-248p" href="#orig-248p" class="marker">[248p]</a><br/>
The next day he examined the patient again. The pulse was even, and the person was calm. Therefore, he used a medicine to soothe the mind and harmonize the vital energies to slightly transform the phlegm. He followed this with good judgment. Then, the young man of this year traveled north with Gao Jie and Han Yuan. All his sons possessed beautiful and refined features. They were talented and cultured. This was a sign of abundant blessings just beginning to flourish.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, he had long practiced meditation with Shen Chan, and frequently consulted with teachers and physicians for urgent illnesses, all of whom responded effectively and cured him. In autumn, he had a slight cold with a feeling of chill.<a id="trans-249p" href="#orig-249p" class="marker">[249p]</a><br/>
The teacher pointed. Immediately, a troubled expression appeared. I instinctively knew it was an ill omen. In the midst of winter, a great change occurred. I, a man without a father, was as it were, a divine being in the skill of the Zen master. Alas. (Li Pengfei of Jixian wept a blood letter upon a苫次.) Volume Thirteen, Case 13, The Observation of Dampness and Heat Ascending to Attack the Upper Body, Causing the Lower Body to Become Vacant. Golden衢 observed excessive fatigue. The yang heat rose, compounded with dampness and heat.

Over ninety years old. His constitution was predominantly yang. He experienced dizziness and weakness in his limbs. He had suffered from this condition for several years. He retired to a quiet place for rest. Medical treatments were ineffective. Zuo Yi cured him using the pulse method, where the pulse was floating and slippery, a large pulse corresponding to the “High Chapter” method described. I said, “A chronically high and yang constitution is a cause of many illnesses. Xu Hui’s writings state: “For those with a high and prosperous constitution…”<a id="trans-251p" href="#orig-251p" class="marker">[251p]</a><br/>
The head, face, and all orifices are the realm of the void. They are the meeting place of the six yang meridians. The upper orifices are all odd. They are particularly yang within yang. The厥阴 and 风火 turn inwardly, causing the steaming and rising of bodily fluids. Like mist ascending, the 清阳 is unfavorable, resulting in dizziness. And phlegm, being a substance, follows the rising and falling of the air, nowhere to be found. When there is excess air, it is fire.<a id="trans-252p" href="#orig-252p" class="marker">[252p]</a><br/>
It originates in the upper Jiao [organ system]. Then it causes dizziness. It flows downward, and then it results in impotence and paralysis. It enters the limbs, then it is like paralysis. It resides in the channels [organ systems], then it causes convulsions and mania. The deficiency of Yin and the excess of Yang is the cause. Treatment begins by clearing phlegm and fire. Next, it suppresses the Liver Wind, and finally, it nourishes blood and conceals Yang, gradually seeking efficacy.<a id="trans-253p" href="#orig-253p" class="marker">[253p]</a><br/>

On the thirty-fifth day or more. The liver yang was exceedingly vigorous. Yet the constitution was thin and weak. He suffered from the reversal of phlegm fire. Each day he vomited phlegm amounting to two bowls. A rattling sound was heard in his throat. His face was red and irritable. The tongue’s center was deeply red and moist without coating. The pulse was thin, fine, and deficient in number. This was due to the reception of external wind evil. The Lesser Yang Wood Fire was particularly strong. The wind gained strength from the fire and became more unruly. The wind and fire fanned each other. The Lung Metal was subjected to restraint.<a id="trans-255p" href="#orig-255p" class="marker">[255p]</a><br/>
The essence produced by Yang Ming was burned by fire and became phlegm. It spins and reverses. Therefore, when expelled, it cannot be emptied, and excessive phlegm expulsion damages the kidneys and depletes the essence. Hence, there is internal heat. *Su Wen* says: those with flushed cheeks are because their heat is connected to the kidneys. Phlegm follows the breath as it rises and descends. When the breath rises, the phlegm rises with it. The treatment should employ the method of drawing smoke from the bottom of a cauldron; first, using clear fire to subdue the phlegm, once the phlegm is subdued, the phlegm will naturally subside.<a id="trans-256p" href="#orig-256p" class="marker">[256p]</a><br/>
Fang Shu treats the heart and liver’s fire with bitter cold. It treats the lung and kidney’s fire with salty cold. There was an established method in the past. The formula uses salty, bitter, and cold descending methods, cinnabar, gardenia root, Chinese hop, indigo, bamboo powder, bamboo sap, apricot kernel, greater galangal, Chinese wild chrysanthemum, antler of the gaur, stone-etched jasper, Sichuan honeycrisant, Cocculus horagai, sea-floating stone. It adds three *zhi mi* (finger-shaped fungus) *luing* (grains) of *zhimi* to it. It is taken continuously for three courses. It levels the heat and alleviates the symptoms of convulsions and asthma, and it cures them. The patient rests comfortably as usual. Later, a formula for clearing the lungs, descending the fire, and transforming phlegm was used. Such as *shan san*, *mai dong*, *shi hu*, bamboo powder, indigo, oyster shell, turtle shell, honey, Sichuan honeycrisant, sea-floating stone, *fu ling*, *xian ban xia*, tangerine peel, *shou mu*, *xue geng*. It follows the formula for its administration. It is treated for several courses and it heals. <br/>

The case of a Chen family male suffering from convulsions and asthma, a chronic illness.<br/>
<br/>
A seventeen-year-old male of the Chen family suffered from convulsions and asthma, a chronic illness.<a id="trans-257p" href="#orig-257p" class="marker">[257p]</a><br/>
Suffering from epilepsy for three or four years. Initially, the illness manifested for several months. Subsequently, it gradually approached its full extent, even occurring several times in a single day. The mouth corner drooped and saliva flowed. Therefore, he sought my treatment. I examined his pulse: the right side was three *bù* with heavy, flowing water; the left side was tense and knotted with the fingers; the left *cun* (a pulse point) overflowed into the *ji* (wrist). I diagnosed the illness as arising from the obstruction of phlegm and fire, with the *pénglüè* (胞络, fetal cords/channels) blocking the channels of the spirit. Consequently, he would become unconscious and collapse.<a id="trans-258p" href="#orig-258p" class="marker">[258p]</a><br/>
First, use Niu Huang Qing Xin Pill with a cup of bamboo sap. Add two or three drops of ginger juice to dissolve and swallow. Then, use fresh Shangbu (Sanguispinosa), Yukin, Dan Nan Xing, Ling Yang Jiao, Sang Ye, Gou Feng, and Juicehong to clear the channels and dispel stagnation. Subsequently, use Ning Shen An Hun, supplemented with gold and jade, to block the phlegm and fire and facilitate the path of clearing. Each morning, take four chi of olive paste mixed with a small amount of alum powder, dissolved in hot water, and swallowed. After taking for a month, the illness ceased to recur.<br/>

<br/>
Treatment of Phlegm and Fire Syndrome – Mr. Lai from Xiao Shan<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Lai had a chronic condition of phlegm and fire. When ill, his speech was slurred and his tongue was dry. His hands trembled and his feet were weak. He had been treated for many years without success.<a id="trans-259p" href="#orig-259p" class="marker">[259p]</a><br/>
The patient was examined by me. The pulse was large and slippery. There was a discharge from the Sun Gate (cinnabar orifice). Stools were frequently constipated. However, the appetite was notably strong. I said, “This is an affliction caused by phlegm and fire. Use hyacinth horn, fragrant spike (stone spikenard), turmeric (郁金), bamboo sap, with a small amount of ginger juice, snow lotus (麦冬), angelica sinensis (远志), honey orchid (石斛), greater galangal (黄连), bamboo fiber (竹茹), feugiat (茯神), angelica sinensis (生地), and white seedpod (川贝母) for the prescription. Also, instruct the patient to take three chi (units) of white gold pills. Continue taking them for several days. The pulse is now restrained and clear. The hands are also no longer trembling. All symptoms have subsided in order of severity.<a id="trans-260p" href="#orig-260p" class="marker">[260p]</a><br/>
He then prescribed elanthium, bamboo sap, turmeric, white gold powder. He added oyster, angelica sinensis, jujubes, tortoise shell powder, honeyed glue, polygonum multiflorum, lotus seeds, thorny stamen, honeysuckle, Tianwang Pill for replenishing the heart. He adjusted the prescription for several courses, and it was cured. Until the next new year. Because he indulged in wine, the phlegm-fire rose again, and his voice became hoarse. He again sought his treatment. I said, “Phlegm is a readily generated substance. If the old symptoms recur, continue to use Frontal Hair Powder. When phlegm-fire rises, use angelica sinensis, cinnabar, buckbean, snow lotus,淮山, chrysanthemum, lotus seeds, thorny stamen, honey orchid, honeysuckle, astralage, spikenard, tangerine peel, oyster, white mu danpi, dragon bone, bamboo sap as the prescription. Add a small amount of green fruit paste mixed with alum powder. Take four chi daily, dissolving in hot water.”<a id="trans-261p" href="#orig-261p" class="marker">[261p]</a><br/>
Only a small amount of wine is best. From then on, they lived in peace for several years. Afterwards, they did not abstain from wine, and consumed rich flavors, which then caused illness. They advised them to follow the method of the inverted storehouse to expel phlegm, thereby cleansing the stomach. They then suspected and feared each other, and the illness did not ultimately depart from their body.<br/>
<br/>
Volume 13, Case 2.<br/>
<br/>
The case of two people with deficient qi and blood, whose limbs were paralyzed for half their bodies, and a cure.<br/>
<br/>
A guest from Huidu, about fifty years old, suddenly found that his right half of his body was like a paralytic, unable to lie in bed and turn, with the muscles and veins not rigidly fixed in haste.<a id="trans-262p" href="#orig-262p" class="marker">[262p]</a><br/>
There was no pain. Zhao Yu examined him. The right pulse was thin and fine, like silk. It was deficient and weak. The left pulse was smooth and even, without signs of illness. A careful examination revealed no wind symptoms. The body was fat with abundant muscle. It was not due to phlegm and fire, but to deficiency of qi and blood. It was a deviation of a disease arising from this combination. Following the method of Wang Qingren’s “Five Medicines to Restore Yin and Yang,” using five portions of Huang (Yellow) Apricot kernels, five chi (units) of Angelica Sinensis, two chi of Chinese Red Peony.<a id="trans-263p" href="#orig-263p" class="marker">[263p]</a><br/>
Dry lohan, chuanxiong each one qian. Xuetian, ninlongteng each three qian. Honghua one qian. Danshen three qian. Take three zhi. And the right pulse gradually increased. The limbs slightly able to extend and move. Eight zhi while rising and living as usual. The saying of returning and merging was not mistaken. Afterwards, with returning, shao, san, ling, cao, danshen, gui, mugua, honghua, chuanxiong, xini, xuetian, dogji etc. nourished blood and supplemented qi. Relaxed meridians and invigorated the flow of vital energy. Instructed to take the infused wine regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Volume 12, Case 1, Examination of Shen Mou, a patient with a disorder of the spirit and epilepsy.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Mou was forty-ish when he experienced occasional restlessness.<a id="trans-264p" href="#orig-264p" class="marker">[264p]</a><br/>
The epilepsy immediately manifested. The spirit was not self-controlled. There were delusional words and utterances. He was unaware of his surroundings. He sometimes spoke as if addressing ghosts. The pulse at the two cun points was empty and large, lacking proper rhythm. The two wrist strings were tightly drawn. The tongue had a central depression with fissures. I diagnosed the illness as belonging to a condition of deficiency. The spirit did not reside in its dwelling; a deficient spirit causes fright. This was not due to malevolent spirits, but rather a deficiency of vital energy, causing illusory sights and words.<a id="trans-265p" href="#orig-265p" class="marker">[265p]</a><br/>
Using Ginger and Dragon Pearl Powder Decoction with Dates Paste. Instructed him to take thirty doses continuously. Took twenty doses, and the illness did not recur. Following this method with the case of Chen surnamed, it was a case of both deficiency and excess, a corresponding treatment. One must thoroughly examine the symptoms, clarify the lower channels, so that the medication will be effective. The symptoms are varied, and treatment should not be rigidly applied. One must consider the four characters of deficiency, excess, cold, and heat. Ginger and Dragon Pearl Powder Decoction has a wondrous effect, like rotating the heavens and earth.<a id="trans-266p" href="#orig-266p" class="marker">[266p]</a><br/>

Chapter Mid-Autumn, Case Examination, Treatment of Golden-Eyed and White Lily Disease,<br/>
<br/>
The designated elementary school students, Golden-Eyed and White Lily. His wife died of dysentery in the autumn of the ninth year of the Bingxu era. She also suffered from damp-heat symptoms. That year was also the year of the dysentery of Ding Hai. I treated many cases that I cured. And this was also the time when the Golden-Eyed and White Lily sought me out.<br/>
<br/>
It was at the time of the winter solstice. It seems he suffered from damp-heat after the autumn, lost his ability to clear and expel evil, and his vital essence and blood were exhausted due to grief and opium addiction.<a id="trans-267p" href="#orig-267p" class="marker">[267p]</a><br/>
Restlessness and insomnia. The eyes did not even meet when closing them for a month. During the day, he was unable to sit or lie still. A multitude of feelings mingled. He desired to eat but could not, and he desired to sleep but could not. His diet was sometimes suitable, sometimes unsuitable. His mind and awareness were like those of a madman. His pulse was excessively large and empty. His fingers were extremely disordered. I said, “This is precisely the condition described by Jin Keyi as ‘Bai He’ (hundred herbs) disease. Furthermore, it is compounded by phlegm rising upwards.” Then I prescribed a decoction of hundred herbs and earth turmeric.<a id="trans-268p" href="#orig-268p" class="marker">[268p]</a><br/>
A medicine to subdue phlegm and reduce fever was prescribed. Two doses brought a slight measure of sleep, but the mental clarity remained like dementia. Therefore, it was exclusively used to clear the phlegm and fever, and calming and stabilizing the mind and spirit were added. Adjustments were made upon entry and exit. Recovery began in the tenth month of the Ding year.<br/>
<br/>
Volume 4, Case 3,<br/>
Zhao Zhong-weng’s Treatment of Headwind Attacks<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Zhong-weng, nearly eighty years old, formerly a magistrate of Zhenhai, frequently suffered from headwind attacks, with spasms occurring daily and nightly in his left cheek, forehead, and crown of the head, due to disrupted channels.<a id="trans-269p" href="#orig-269p" class="marker">[269p]</a><br/>
I felt as if a fireworks display was being released, surging upwards in a disordered manner. I could not sleep through the entire night. The pulse was weak, smooth, and rapid. Sometimes it was strong and firm, yet excessively large. I attributed this to the wind and yang ascending to disturb it; the yang of the liver and gallbladder mingled with phlegm and violently surged upwards. There was redness along the temples, extending to the ears and both cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
The treatment called for vigorous acupuncture, aiming to thoroughly drain the blood. The *Ling Shu* text states: “Whenever the meridians manifest, drain them completely.” Subsequently, acupuncture was performed on the cheeks, the brow-point, the jaw-point, the stomach-point, the valley-point, the lily-point, and the fragrant-point. Six Yin channels were traversed.<a id="trans-270p" href="#orig-270p" class="marker">[270p]</a><br/>
Once the needle was inserted four times, the muscle spasms ceased. Then one used silkworm pupae, mulberry leaves, *Magnolia officinalis*, *Gardenia florida*, *Dendrobium officinale*, *Caesalpinia gilliana*, *Plantago bark*, indigo, lozenges of *Cucumis melo*, oysters, and *Adhatoda chrysantha*. It nourished the blood and connected the vital energy. It was treated in several courses, and the patient became tranquil. The following spring, it sprouted again, but not as vigorously as before. At that time, the Six Excretions were rampant, and acupuncture was not possible. Instead, a method of pressing was used. The fingers were used in place of the needles. After pressing, the pain subsided somewhat. When the snow melted and the sky cleared, the needle was used on the *Valley of Wind*.<a id="trans-271p" href="#orig-271p" class="marker">[271p]</a><br/>
The prescription was as described previously. Taking several doses resulted in a complete recovery. Afterwards, minor headaches would recur, and administering the same prescription produced an effect. Xu Hui wrote, “For disorders of the meridians, needles are not used; only medicine is employed. It is rarely effective.”  Volume 13, Case 2. Also, the case of Zhao and Sun’s daughters-in-law with blood deficiency and headaches was verified.  Zhong and Sun’s wives both suffered from headaches. I was asked to examine them. Their pulse was floating and taken with a large dose, but pressing firmly yielded no effect.<a id="trans-272p" href="#orig-272p" class="marker">[272p]</a><br/>
Two feet were particularly severe. Left Guan briefly combined strings. I said, “This pertains to the internal deficiency of liver and blood. The *Qijing* [Standard Treatise on Internal Medicine] has the responsibility of nourishing the vital essence; the illness, though originating above, is fundamentally rooted below. The cause of the headache lies in the upward course of the *Du* [Governing Vessel] meridian along the top of the head. The medicine must be administered downwards, which is the method of treatment for illness in the *Shang* [Inner Canon] as well. Using a prescription of four substances, with safflower, radix notoginseng, radix dioscoreae sanguinea, radix polygala, radix borneol, honeybee wax, honeysuckle, chrysanthemum, and dendrobium, it was cured in several courses. These two conditions are a matter of both deficiency and excess.<br/>

Wei Yuan’s treatment of phlegm fire rising, causing fright, insomnia, and its efficacy.<br/>
<br/>
Wei Yuan, the *Fan Si* [Assistant Physician]’s, treatment of phlegm fire rising, causing fright, insomnia, and its efficacy.<a id="trans-273p" href="#orig-273p" class="marker">[273p]</a><br/>
The patient suffered from palpitations, anxiety, insomnia, and a disordered heart rhythm. It had persisted for more than two months. A physician’s assistant diagnosed a deficiency syndrome and treated it, with improvement following treatment, but then the symptoms worsened. He then sought my examination. The pulse was floating, smooth, and swollen in the fingertips. The eyes were yellow, and the tongue coating was white and greasy. I diagnosed that Yang Ming was not properly closed, indicating a condition of phlegm and fire rising, and damp-heat internally stagnating. I prescribed a formula consisting of half-summer-harvest ophiopogon, sorghum, orange peel, bamboo bark, Sichuan poplars, star anise, Chinese hop, licorice root, *Zexie* (species of plant), and *Guashe* (calcium carbonate). It was cooked with willow charcoal, and two courses of the medicine brought about sleep, and the palpitations and anxiety were completely relieved.<a id="trans-274p" href="#orig-274p" class="marker">[274p]</a><br/>
He then prescribed a formula of clear phlegm to subdue fever, to transform dampness, and to moisten the conditions. The yellow spots in the eyes receded. The stomach also gradually strengthened. All the symptoms were completely cured. This illness afflicted many people. If treated with a general deficiency cure, it is like adding fuel to a burning house.<a id="trans-275p" href="#orig-275p" class="marker">[275p]</a><br/>
The skin was hot as if burned with a branding iron. The itching was intense, and scratching caused bleeding. He had suffered from this ailment for several years. Both internal and external physicians were unable to diagnose the nature of his illness. On the 29th day of the summer term, I examined him. The pulse in all six positions was abnormally full and turbulent, with scattered fingers. I said, “This illness is severe, and it is undoubtedly hempus (haeemorragy). The eyebrows, nose, pillars of the limbs, and joints can all fall off. People of Wu and Yue rarely suffer from this. However, those who have received toxic miasma in the southern mountains have it.” It was an evil of wind and dampness, entering the skin through the meridians and causing it to remain without being expelled.<a id="trans-276p" href="#orig-276p" class="marker">[276p]</a><br/>
He turned inward and deepened the condition. It entered as heat arising from blood separation. The heat battled with wind damp. This resulted in white scales. Layer upon layer resembled the patches of hair loss. Therefore, it could not be completely removed. It is advisable to expel the dampness of the meridians, clear the heat separated from the blood, and moisten the dryness of the skin. It may gradually improve. The official said so. The medicine for transforming dampness had been taken for over a hundred doses, yet it had no effect.<a id="trans-277p" href="#orig-277p" class="marker">[277p]</a><br/>
I say: Transforming dampness is the fundamental principle. However, the medicinal flavors must be combined, each possessing a distinct character. When treating dampness that resides within the channels, if one merely employs methods of penetration, purging, and bitter-drying to treat the viscera, it will be of no benefit. The formula should instead utilize silver flowers two ounces, honeyed mugwort six *qian* (small measures), dried sweet woodruff eight *qian*, red peony eight *qian*, silkworm chrysalises three *qian*, star anise, angelica, loquat, *Wu Ling Xian*, yellow chrysanthemum, safflower, and danpi (Chinese herbaceous root) each three *qian*.<a id="trans-278p" href="#orig-278p" class="marker">[278p]</a><br/>
Live pheasant head one pound. Glycyrrhiza glabra six *qian*, angelica sinensis six *qian*, atractylodes macrocarpa half *qian*, small seed of angelica two *liang*, long flowing water three large bowls. Cook in a large sand pot until a large bowl is formed. Administer slowly. Externally, use ephedra, atractylodes macrocarpa, peony root, silkworm cocoon, white spirit, wildginger, Chinese knotweed, bitter ginseng, magnolia, licorice, red sandalwood, greater celandine, Chinese wild chrysanthemum, each three *qian*. Melt ten *liang* of true hemp oil, strain off the residue. Add remaining blood eight *qian*. Yellow wax two *liang*, fresh pig fat one *liang*, black lead two *qian*. When itchy, apply fresh summer cloth dampened with the medicine to the affected area.<a id="trans-279p" href="#orig-279p" class="marker">[279p]</a><br/>
As expected, the condition improved after a month following the method. It was a rare case in ordinary practice. Simply quiet contemplation and reasoning with one’s mind were sufficient. Following the principles and aligning with the established methods yielded effective results. Indeed, the ancient techniques were remarkably consistent with this case.<br/>
<br/>
Case Record, Volume Two: Treatment of Wounds with Insect Infestation.<br/>
<br/>
A cart driver presented with a lesion resembling insect damage, numbering in the thousands. It was not a true sore, but caused intense itching that was difficult to endure. The condition persisted year after year, worsening during the summer and autumn, and improving in the spring and winter. I treated it.<a id="trans-280p" href="#orig-280p" class="marker">[280p]</a><br/>
He observed that it appeared as if insects were present. However, the Fang script did not prescribe this method. He considered that the long-standing condition of癞头 (làotóu –癞头, scab on the head) caused the emergence of insects. He employed the method of using powdered arsenic to boil eggs for killing insects. He took two duck eggs, removed their shells, and mixed them with two chi (钱) of powdered arsenic, stirring until well combined. He added chopped scallions and boiled them in lard until the fragrance arose. He applied the hot mixture over the affected area, covering it with cloth and binding it tightly. The insects, drawn by the fragrance, emerged and were then fed. The itching was extremely intense, penetrating to the bone. After it cooled, he unwrapped it to examine it.<a id="trans-281p" href="#orig-281p" class="marker">[281p]</a><br/>
Extracted were countless exceedingly small insects. Then, bitter cold was used to detoxify and dispel moisture with a medicinal preparation. The decoction was simmered and applied repeatedly. The ailment was permanently eradicated. Yi Fang said that this ailment was common among us. There was no one who had been cured. Unaware of this remarkable cure, he opened a new path. All methods that achieve extraordinary success, even in minor illnesses, are pondered over and discovered. They bring an immeasurable amount of joy.<br/>

Treatment of Chest Pain Caused by Insects<br/>
<br/>
One young woman, twelve years old, suffered from severe chest pain.<a id="trans-282p" href="#orig-282p" class="marker">[282p]</a><br/>
The patient tossed and rolled in bed, emitting a loud cry. Treatment with medicine for suppressing appetite and moving qi was ineffective. It was mixed with a small amount of decoction of Chinese hibiscus paste. After taking it, some effect was observed. However, it remained ineffective. I observed that his muscles had become thin and wasted, and he had yellow patches resembling crab claws on his face. When questioned, he complained of pain in his anus like that of hemorrhoids. His pulse was sometimes tight and firm, and sometimes weak and rapid, with pauses in between. This corresponded with the symptoms described by Jin Kui in his “Fox Confusion of Diseases,” and therefore, following the external method of killing insects from the “Outer Table,” I prepared a powder consisting of equal parts of annatto seeds, cinnamon heart, turmeric, horseshoe root, Lei pills, dried ginger, and licorice root.<a id="trans-283p" href="#orig-283p" class="marker">[283p]</a><br/>
Each dose was two or three cash coins. One hundred measures of boiling water were mixed with half a spoonful of honey. Two courses were taken. Afterwards, the appetite gradually recovered. Muscles became plump. It has persisted for six or seven years. This illness no longer recurs.<br/>

From a resident of the Blue Banner. A young boy, of strong constitution, suffered from severe abdominal pain. I examined him. His complexion was pale and yellow, his muscles had atrophied, and his pulse was weak.<a id="trans-284p" href="#orig-284p" class="marker">[284p]</a><br/>
Suddenly great, suddenly small. Like a simmering stew, like boiling water. The tongue is red, with tiny white spots. The illness has persisted for many days. I said, “This illness originates from careless eating of spicy and rich foods, which generate heat and give rise to insects. Over time, these insects grow larger and more numerous. Now, the fat and grease of the internal organs have been completely ravaged by these insects; even divine elixirs cannot cure it.”<a id="trans-285p" href="#orig-285p" class="marker">[285p]</a><br/>
His family repeatedly sought my assistance for four times. I was troubled at the time. Unable to help, I established a Lin Mei (连梅) prescription. In the afternoon, I was invited to go and examine the patient. I politely declined and expressed my gratitude. The patient died two days later.<br/>

Two Cases of Treatment: Gas Stagnation and Chest Pain<br/>
Dong Yu was over forty years old and suffered from chest pain, nausea, hoarseness, and a discharge from the throat. Her headache was not due to a single cause. I examined her pulse, which was heavy, fine, and firm. I said that the pulse method was incorrect, and the pulse was heavy.<a id="trans-286p" href="#orig-286p" class="marker">[286p]</a><br/>
Therefore, one knows it is the vital energy. Illness arises from a lack of smooth emotions. Anger stagnates the liver. Wood-based deficiencies invade earth. The heart and spleen’s vital energy becomes knotted. The method should be to open the vital energy and level the liver. First, use returns (gui), peony root (shao), fragrant mugwort (xiang fu), gardenia fruit (ji hong), spikenard root (yu jin), black cardamom (kou ren), buchu (柴胡), danpi (丹皮), fresh orange leaves (鲜橘叶), blessed fingers (佛手花), valerian root (瓦楞子), and oyster shell (牡蛎). First, boil raw iron in water, then simmer the medicine and take it for three courses. All symptoms diminish by eighty-nine percent. Afterwards, use Xiao Yao San with dates, honeysuckle, fragrant mugwort, sea snail (海螵蛸), and oyster shell. Take it for more than twenty courses and it will be cured.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, an elderly woman, Xu Yu, nearing fifty, suffered from chest pain.<a id="trans-287p" href="#orig-287p" class="marker">[287p]</a><br/>
The moon’s appointment was infrequent. Yet it had not yet ceased. The body was plump, the pulse thin and slack, yet deficient. I diagnosed this as blood deficiency and stagnation of Qi. After administering Dan San Yin (Dan San Drink), the condition improved. Though these two symptoms both stemmed from stagnation of Qi, they differed in having a predominance of the Liver and a deficiency of Blood.<br/>

Treatment of Chest Pain in a Woman Named Mao<br/>
<br/>
A woman named Mao suffered from severe chest pain, rolling about in bed and nearly despairing. Her menstrual cycle was irregular, and she sought my examination. The pulse was deep and thin, with a slippery sensation upon palpation.<a id="trans-288p" href="#orig-288p" class="marker">[288p]</a><br/>
My fingernails and lips were both blue. I said, “The pulse is sluggish, indicating blood stagnation. I tightened my grasp on the fingers, and it was evident that the blood was clustered and congealed, causing pain in the chest cavity. Upon further inquiry, I realized that half a month prior, the patient had been struck by a hard piece of wood on the chest. This was undoubtedly blood stasis lingering in the chest cavity and causing pain. With a prescription of Gui Pi Lan (归尾), Chi Shao (赤芍), Tao Ren (桃仁), Dan San (丹参), Dong Yang San (东洋参), Su Huo (琥珀), Lu Xiang (乳香), Pu Huang (蒲黄), and Wu Ling Zhi, it was cured. Thus, the way to treat illness is to pay close attention to all four diagnostic methods, which allows one to accurately target the disease, and all remedies administered are effective.<a id="trans-289p" href="#orig-289p" class="marker">[289p]</a><br/>
A carpenter suffered from pain in his flank and waist due to a contusion. Blood stasis remained, obstructing the meridians, causing severe pain, reversed breathing, and extreme difficulty in bearing it. He also experienced chills and fever. His pulse was tight and rapid. This was due to the blood stasis obstructing the meridians, leading to stagnation of the vital energy. Therefore, he was treated with a prescription of Guihu (Chinese herbaceous root), Tao Ren (prunus seed), Su梗 (licorice root), Ju luo (red knotweed), Si gua luo (ivy), Lushi (benzoin), Mojiao (resinous benzoin), Honghua (poppy flower), San Li Qi (Angelica sinensis), Chuan Shan Jia (guanaco horn), Ni Xi (hydrangea), Qing Congguan (green onion). Two courses of treatment resulted in complete recovery.<br/>
<br/>
A woman named Chen from the northern gate of a town suffered from pain in her left flank, caused by the stagnation of qi and obstruction of the meridians.<a id="trans-290p" href="#orig-290p" class="marker">[290p]</a><br/>
He connected the diagnosis at the door of the period and the door of the section. The pulse was heavy, fine, and astringent. Previously, he prescribed fragrant mugwort, benzoin, and red flower. He added fragrant atractylodes, gardenia, bupleurum, and honeysuckle. It healed with two courses of treatment.<br/>

Volume Two, Medical Records, Treatment of Chest Pain, a case of a man surnamed Yu who suffered from chest pain that extended to his back. This was what Jin Kui referred to as chest pain. He treated him with a mixture of栝蒌 (quat relative) and white leek, and he recovered. This was a method established by ancient practitioners, easily treating this illness. The lower-level practitioners did not know it.<a id="trans-291p" href="#orig-291p" class="marker">[291p]</a><br/>
And because of this, the harm caused was very great. Therefore, it was preserved. Volume Two, Medical Cases, The Treatment of Běn Tún Qì (Běn Tún Gas) – The Wu Shan Shui Lu Cai Shen Dian (Wu Mountain Water and Land Wealth God Temple). The three masters suffered greatly from Běn Tún. The gas surged upwards into the abdomen, causing immediate severe pain. A hard, solid mass rose from the lower abdomen, causing vomiting and an inability to eat. The patient’s appearance was habitually stooped and weak, unbearable. Treatment was administered with cinnamon, wu ya (Wu Yu), Dong Yang San (Dong Yang Herb Formula), Gui (Gui Pi),芍 (Sheng Di Huang), Ban Xia (Half Flower Root), Fu Ling (Poria), Xiao Hui Xiang (Anise Seed), Huang Lian (Greater Celandine), Wu Mei (Prunella), Mu Xiang (Agarwood), Chuan Lian Zi (Piper Nigrum), Gan Jiang (Ginger), Zhi Cao (Silphium). The Lesser Yin,厥阴, and Yang Ming channels were treated. Each morning, on an empty stomach, the patient was instructed to swallow three *qian* (grains) of Ren Qi Wan (Kidney Qi Pill) and to apply灸 (moxibustion) to the Zhong Wan (Mid Abdomen), Yuan Guan (Gate of the Well), and Yuan Chen (Source Gate) acupuncture points. The illness then recovered.<a id="trans-292p" href="#orig-292p" class="marker">[292p]</a><br/>
He regretted his severe opium addiction. He was also timid and weak. His vital essence was exhausted. Later, in the following year, he suffered a sudden spring fever.<br/>

Fox Hernia: Clinical Experience<br/>
Within the inner office of the Shiyi Medical Bureau on Hanguan’s Back Street, a young man named Chang was treated. He suffered from fox hernia, with a localized pain. The testicles dropped downwards when he was upright, and ascended into the lower abdomen when he lay down. The scrotum was red and swollen and painful. I examined him. The pulse was large and tense on the left, and deficient and moist on the right. I said, “It is due to the stagnation of damp heat in the Yang Ming.”<a id="trans-293p" href="#orig-293p" class="marker">[293p]</a><br/>
The wind turns inward within the wood (viscera), specifically the厥阴. Therefore, this condition exists. Indeed, Yangming and 厥阴 both govern the zongjin (vital organs). Their pulses follow the yin channels. When pressed against the area of the xiafu (hypochondrium), it is treated by first using methods to dispel dampness and loosen the air. Then, following the method of Chen Xiu Yuan, a prescription was used containing two Chen Tangs, wood fragrance, Sichuan pepper, magnolia seeds, carpus seeds, and small fennel. After taking three courses of treatment, the patient became somewhat relieved. Subsequently, the Chen and Ren meridians were stimulated, and the condition was cured.<br/>

Case of He Shi Quan’s Treatment of Sudden Attacks of Cold Pain.<br/>
<br/>
Ningcheng’s He Shi Quan and Shi Cai were neighbors. Shi Cai was a friend of Shi Cai. In the winter of Xin Si, they invited each other to drink lightly at a small restaurant. Shi Cai was also present.<a id="trans-294p" href="#orig-294p" class="marker">[294p]</a><br/>
His son, upon a balcony, said, “I suffer from a severe and urgent illness.” He immediately requested a diagnosis and examination. I accompanied him into his room. I only heard his long, drawn-out sighs. I inquired about the cause of his illness. He said that in the afternoon he was still well, but that by a little past the fourth hour, his abdomen began to swell suddenly and severely, becoming as large as a halberd or a chest, hard as stone, and causing him unbearable pain. He vomited and had diarrhea. His pulse was fine but tense.<a id="trans-295p" href="#orig-295p" class="marker">[295p]</a><br/>
The penis entered the abdomen. The bottom of the pouch had a single hole like a navel. He desired to seek Western medicine and cut it open. I said, “Although Westerners have this method, why should you rashly try it and bring misfortune upon yourself? This illness, when it manifests, is extremely severe, and when it subsides, it does so very quickly. If you listen to my use of medicine, it can be healed tonight. They offered comforting words to their family, but did not truly believe it, and prepared Li Zhong Tang, adding three *jian* (small measures) of dried Sichuan root.”<a id="trans-296p" href="#orig-296p" class="marker">[296p]</a><br/>
Half a tael of peach blossom petals. Seven parts of wu ya (Chinese pepper). Instructed him to remain tranquil and conserve his energy. He was not to rush or be hasty. After taking the medicine, he vomited and expelled matter until sunset, but the hernia remained unchanged, and the pain worsened. I considered this a situation where cold and dampness were resisting heat, a deep-seated evil in the lower abdomen. The medicine’s power was still weak and unable to subdue the illness. It was necessary to administer it again to cure it. The patient displayed a troubled expression. I feared he would doubt it. I then invited my colleague, Mr. Wang Junzhong, to consult together.<a id="trans-297p" href="#orig-297p" class="marker">[297p]</a><br/>
The King had already passed the early hour; it was too late. After examining him, he discussed the matter with the physician and agreed with his advice. Then they prepared a mixture of white peony, white lead, and ginger soup, along with a Five-Grain Powder. They continued to use three *shun* (pieces) of fresh white peony root, taking it at two more hours. I went to stay with my friend’s household, fearing that the illness might change and that haphazard medications would lead to danger. I told my father, “If your illness changes in any way, immediately inform me.” After three more hours, his son came to report, saying, “Father’s illness has improved by more than half.”<a id="trans-298p" href="#orig-298p" class="marker">[298p]</a><br/>
I, Great Joy. Quickly hold the lamp and go. The sick man said, “Because I had been sitting for a long time, my buttocks moved, and I suddenly felt as if air was escaping, accompanied by pain and a loss of sensation. I looked at it. My scrotum had become half-expanded, and wrinkles appeared on the skin. The penis had extended half of it. The next day, the swelling and hardness completely disappeared, returning to normal, but I felt a weariness of spirit.”<a id="trans-299p" href="#orig-299p" class="marker">[299p]</a><br/>

Forty-seven years old. Suffering from hemorrhage for more than two months. Continuous, flowing blood. The initial blood was bright red, and after a while it gradually became lighter. If she sat upright, the bleeding would suddenly gush forth. She experienced alternating chills and fever. Her lower body felt as if it were collapsing. She was unable to move in bed. Her complexion was as white as paper, and her lips and tongue lacked color.<a id="trans-300p" href="#orig-300p" class="marker">[300p]</a><br/>
Always I feel my eyes dark and my mind empty. Since the onset of this illness, I have consulted numerous physicians, taking seventy-odd doses of medicine. It was then that they treated me. They examined my pulse at the two Guan (points) and found it to be floating and false, abnormally large. When pressed firmly, it was weak and lacked vitality. The San Li (small orifice) was constricted and disordered. I said to the woman, “The woman is becoming increasingly feeble; her vital essence is nearly exhausted.” Her blood is weaker than in her prime. Now the illness has persisted for a long time.<a id="trans-301p" href="#orig-301p" class="marker">[301p]</a><br/>
The situation is as if a vessel has collapsed. The blood spilled is already equivalent to several measures. The ‘qi jing’ blood, referring to blood from the vital channels, is all blood released due to the collapse. Immediately, one should urgently strengthen the vital energy and blood, though the illness is dangerous. If one follows my prescription exactly, without any alterations, it can still turn a perilous situation into a stable one. Combined with the Blood-Replenishing Soup and the Glue-Eel and Honeycomb Soup method, it is particularly effective in suppressing the vital energy and stopping bleeding. The dosage is yellow orpine (Huang) two ounces. <br/>
<br/>
Ligusticum (Dang) four *qian* (parts/measures).<a id="trans-302p" href="#orig-302p" class="marker">[302p]</a><br/>
Party Root, White Peony, Adhesives, Jinge Tan, Guanzhong Tan, Blood Residue, each three *qian* (small measures). Ginger Charcoal, one *qian* and five *fen*. Dried Wormwood, seven pieces. Du Zhong, Chuan Dian, Sophora Root each two *qian* and five *fen*. Oysters, eight *qian*. Water simmered with half a *zhong* (small measure) of Child’s Boon. Taken in two courses and the blood decreased. Movement in the lower body was slightly restored. Then, the Sophora Root, Chuan Dian, Blood Residue, and Huang (Yellow) were removed. Used six *qian*. Party Root, Korean Party Root, added with Shu Di one *liang* (two *liang* = one *ounce*). Horn of Deer Glue, Bone Glue, each three *qian*. Apricot Seed, one *qian*. Another two courses, the blood stopped and the patient could sit and stand.<a id="trans-303p" href="#orig-303p" class="marker">[303p]</a><br/>
The lips and cheeks exhibited a slight blush of vitality. The pulse showed roots. However, a white discharge was present beneath. <br/>
She then took five courses of medicine, and all her symptoms were completely cured. Following the method of drawing blood to replenish vital energy, the ancient technique could be applied. It was originally a difficult case, but after many hands treated it for a long time, there was no success. Surely this is laughable. <br/>

Mrs. Wei Xiao Yin, born of a half-birth, her treatment and results. <br/>
Mrs. Wei Xiao Yin, over thirty years old. Previously, she had been pregnant in April.<a id="trans-304p" href="#orig-304p" class="marker">[304p]</a><br/>
Because of pain in the waist and pain in the abdomen. Mistaking it for blood stasis. The fetus was aborted by bleeding. After more than a year, a physician was consulted, and he resumed the previous medication, resulting in the abortion. In the tenth month of autumn, the menstrual flow ceased for four months. The pain in the waist and abdomen was as before. He then invited me to examine it. The pulse was taut and slippery, fluctuating irregularly. I said, “This is the pulse of the fetus. How many months has it been?” He replied, “It will be approaching four months.” I said, “The pulse has already departed from the menstrual flow.”<a id="trans-305p" href="#orig-305p" class="marker">[305p]</a><br/>
The fetus was about to be delivered. He earnestly recounted the previous circumstances. I said, “The two previous deliveries occurred in April. Now that the time has arrived, the young shoots are weak and the stems are brittle. Furthermore, he wishes to deliver. He says his waist and abdomen ache, but the blood has not yet flowed. I said, ‘The pulse shows this; it is certain that the fetus will be delivered.’<a id="trans-306p" href="#orig-306p" class="marker">[306p]</a><br/>
The prescription of four substances—*qi four substances*—included angelica root, *du zhong*, Sichuan lovage, *giao ai*, and *sha ren*. The medicine was taken before the blood had begun to flow. The patient had been using this formula for a long time and consulted me. I said, “This formula is correctly treating the miscarriage. However, it is difficult to determine whether the fetus will be able to survive. Nevertheless, it must be taken.” The next day, the bleeding increased. I examined him again. The pulse had diminished. The superficial pulse was somewhat tranquil. I said, “The pulse seems to have a root.”<a id="trans-307p" href="#orig-307p" class="marker">[307p]</a><br/>
The mother said, “The fetus can be preserved.” Since the fetus can be preserved, why is there an excess of blood and pain in the waist and abdomen? I said, “This is due to a failure of diagnosis based on feeling the pulse; the blood has not yet separated. I predict it will certainly descend. It is the blood separated from the meridians that causes this; it will naturally descend presently. If it is stopped with astringent measures, there will be many different illnesses.”<a id="trans-308p" href="#orig-308p" class="marker">[308p]</a><br/>
The blood of those departed must be completely drained. Only then will the blood of those not yet departed cease. However, the term of pregnancy must be supplemented by one month of jujube root. Furthermore, one must administer two courses of the following prescription: Angelica Sinensis, White Peony. Then the blood will stop. Miscarriages and stillbirths will not occur. Alas! How many are misled by medicine and cause the loss of the fetus. Surely this is the fault of the physician. Volume Two, Medical Cases. The Case of a Woman of Zhao Clan Treated for Blood Deficiency After Childbirth. A woman of the Zhao clan, eighteen years old, gave birth to a daughter.<a id="trans-309p" href="#orig-309p" class="marker">[309p]</a><br/>
She collapsed immediately after childbirth, utterly unconscious. Profuse sweating occurred. And above her eyes, a dizziness surged, causing her to lose consciousness. She knew nothing of her surroundings. She urgently summoned me to examine her. I said, “This is due to blood poisoning surging through the Stomach Meridian.” Without waiting, she ordered that three *jin* (measures) of vinegar be placed in the rice pot. Using a cast-iron hammer, she heated it in the charcoal stove until it turned red. She then splashed the hot vinegar on her face and mouth.<a id="trans-310p" href="#orig-310p" class="marker">[310p]</a><br/>
Smoke filled the room. Shortly afterward, the sweat subsided, the eyes opened, and the spirit calmed. Then, a child’s spoonful was given to drink. Four chi of Angelica Sinensis, two chi of Ligusticum Wallichi, one chi each of Prunus Armeniaca, Enhydra Nostocida, Pu-Huang, and Wu Ling Pi. Eight divisions of Ginger Charcoal. Three chi of Black Peony (Ligusticum racemosum). One chi of Hundred Flower Powder. Taken in solution, it was immediately cured. Those who did not know it considered it a method of raising the dead and reviving the deceased. In fact, ancient people already possessed this method. I merely imitated it, and it was a failure. Though the illness was dangerous.<a id="trans-311p" href="#orig-311p" class="marker">[311p]</a><br/>

The Case of a Yao Family’s Abnormality<br/>
The Yao family. Over forty years of age. They had two sons and two daughters. Finally, they gave birth to a child who was nine years old. On the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. The moon’s cycle was irregular. Until winter, the illness did not improve, and she did not get out of bed for half a year. Afterward, her abdomen became large as a large earthenware jar, her muscles completely dissolved, her complexion was dark and sickly, and she needed someone to support her as she turned in bed.<a id="trans-312p" href="#orig-312p" class="marker">[312p]</a><br/>
Sometimes the abdomen feels like a twisting pain. After the pain subsides, hunger follows. Hunger leads to a desire to eat. However, the appetite was twice as strong as before. He consulted a physician to examine it. Some said it was due to the stagnation of fetal qi, others said it was due to dampness, still others said it was due to insect poisoning causing distension, or blood accumulation. All these diagnoses proved ineffective. In the spring of the tenth year of the Dinghai reign, the illness worsened. He consulted with me to examine it.<a id="trans-313p" href="#orig-313p" class="marker">[313p]</a><br/>
The pulse on the right hand was loose in the floating part. The sinking part did not harmonize with the fifth. The left three parts were all strong and tense. Pain was present after examination. I said, “Pain after the pulse cannot be relied upon. Examine again tomorrow. Perhaps a definite prescription can be determined. However, the fundamental cause is not the fetal pulse. Such strange symptoms must be recognized for their true nature; perhaps a single blow will suffice. They will believe it.”<a id="trans-314p" href="#orig-314p" class="marker">[314p]</a><br/>
The next day, a follow-up examination was conducted. The left pulse was strong but not firm. The right pulse was like a thick soup or boiling water. Upon pressing it, it felt fine and soft like silk. There was no movement with it; it seemed as if it were about to cease. I said, “Comparing yesterday’s and today’s pulse findings, there is a great difference. In treating illness, one must first grasp the essential principles before acting. With such a pulse, which is so irregular, how can I dare to treat it lightly?”<a id="trans-315p" href="#orig-315p" class="marker">[315p]</a><br/>
I said, it is permissible to discuss this further in the afternoon. Then, I went to examine patients in the late afternoon, but their pulse signs continued to change. Both hands frequently showed signs of rest, sometimes rapid, sometimes slow. Consequently, I realized this pulse had no fixed pattern. I inquired whether the pain was associated with movement within the abdomen. Whether the pain location was fixed, or whether it was associated with movement, was without fixedness. It was sometimes on the navel, sometimes beside the navel, sometimes in the left and right side of the lower ribs, and movement invariably caused pain.<a id="trans-316p" href="#orig-316p" class="marker">[316p]</a><br/>
If there is no movement, there is no pain. I said, “The pulse changes repeatedly. And surely pain begins with movement. The stomach is excessively strong, and the muscles are wasting away daily. This is undoubtedly a strange birth. However, such a birth must be delivered. The medicine is certainly poisonous, and its effects are life or death. I also find it difficult to decide.”<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, if it does not move, it will certainly die. Moving it may sometimes offer a chance of survival. The woman said.<a id="trans-317p" href="#orig-317p" class="marker">[317p]</a><br/>
If possible, let me descend. Though dying, I harbor no resentment. My present body is like a huge stone. Support requires another person. The family’s poverty is like a washing. The sun’s rising is difficult. Life is not preferable to death.<br/>
<br/>
The husband and wife both earnestly requested medicine. Therefore, the neighbors heard of it. I then prescribed large yellow (da Huang) one ounce, attar of piper (fu zi) five chi (approximately 3.75 ounces), dried ginger, cinnamon heart, Sichuan hornbeam (chuan wu), Lei pills, tiger sperm (he shi), peach seeds (tao ren), white atractylodes (niu xi), and mastic (zhi shi) each two chi (approximately 1.875 ounces). Bean frost (ba dou feng) four parts, musk one part.<a id="trans-318p" href="#orig-318p" class="marker">[318p]</a><br/>
Fine powder of cinnabar was used. Honey was refined to form pills. Five chi were administered by drinking hot water. After taking one dose, a great disturbance occurred in the abdomen. The pain intensified, and the fetus remained within. Ten chi were then administered, and approximately two hours later, a large amount of watery fluid was discharged. Subsequently, two monstrous beings were born, their shapes round and elongated like fish, with two horns each, possessing both mouth and eyes. Their nature was unknown. The mother was still able to jump after giving birth.<a id="trans-319p" href="#orig-319p" class="marker">[319p]</a><br/>
People were utterly horrified. Subsequently, six *qian* of silver were used. Four *qian* of sweet flag (甘草) were also used. One *zhong* of green beans (绿豆) were employed. A decoction was prepared to dispel its poison. The abdominal pain ceased. Afterwards, remedies were used to nourish the vital energy and blood, and to regulate the spleen and stomach. It took a month before she was able to rise from bed.<br/>
<br/>
It was said that she considered herself reborn.<br/>

The body weakened by external factors and internal deficiencies. Exhaustion was extreme. One was already descending into it and remained at peace. Then one realized the cause of this affliction. It cannot be remedied by relying solely on its outward appearance and vulnerability. Indeed, illness arises from internal deficiencies, and when the illness departs, the body naturally recovers. They say, “Medicine does not cause dizziness, and a severe illness will not recede.” This is precisely what is meant.<br/>

Treatment of Sitting Meditation Causing Deficiency and Hemoptysis – Verified<br/>
<br/>
(Xie Zhire)<a id="trans-321p" href="#orig-321p" class="marker">[321p]</a><br/>
A man was told that he could attain enlightenment through prolonged meditation. He practiced this for a long time. Then his vital energy was completely full, and his spirit ascended to the Dantian, whereupon he was able to enter and maintain samadhi, transcending the suffering of birth and death. Consequently, he refused to sleep, sitting vigil throughout the night. For two months, his body gradually grew thin and weak, with a persistent cough and blood flowing from above. Upon examination, I found his pulse weak and feeble.<a id="trans-322p" href="#orig-322p" class="marker">[322p]</a><br/>
Three conditions are essential. I said, the *Nei Jing* states: “In rising and lying down, there is a time. Do not recklessly exert oneself. Then one’s form and spirit are together, and one completes one’s lifespan of the heavens. One departs only at one hundred years. This is the ancient wisdom teaching the way to longevity. Why, then, does practice achieve this? Surely it does not consist of forcibly sitting and meditating. <br/>
<br/>
Indeed, can it achieve Buddhahood and attain immortality?”<a id="trans-323p" href="#orig-323p" class="marker">[323p]</a><br/>
There is a reason for it. Now return to cultivate your spirit and refine your energy. This is the Way method of cultivation. Teaching is used to illuminate the mind and reveal one’s true nature as the highest. Although sitting meditation is a means to realize one’s true nature, within it lies a profound truth. The Sixth Patriarch’s Platform Sutra says, “Born, one sits and does not lie down. When dying, one lies down and does not sit. It is not in sitting or not sitting. ” This is also a matter for the elder’s self-exploration, and cannot be explained by words.<a id="trans-324p" href="#orig-324p" class="marker">[324p]</a><br/>
If one sits for a stick of incense, one must kneel for a stick of incense. Initially, take slow steps. Afterwards, take firm steps, ensuring that the vital energy and blood circulate throughout the body. Do not allow it to become stagnant. Once two drums are beaten, one must retire to bed. Truly, if one does not rest at the proper time, the blood will not return to its channels, inevitably leading to spitting blood and nosebleeds, etc. Formerly, Zhi Gong Hengshan lectured day and night. Deng Tianwang pitied his labor and gave him a heart-nourishing pill.<a id="trans-325p" href="#orig-325p" class="marker">[325p]</a><br/>
It is connected with it. It is not used skillfully. There are none who stand and fall without it. Like grain and millet, they are the foundation of health. They are full and then excessively consumed. It only harms their life. Wealth is the origin of existence and life. Once obtained, it is recklessly seized. It only harms righteousness. It does not mean that sitting in meditation yields no benefit, but that excessive activity inevitably leads to demonic ways, and then the heart cannot be self-governing. Great Mei Chan Shi said.<a id="trans-326p" href="#orig-326p" class="marker">[326p]</a><br/>
Just mind, just Buddha. This is the essential point of meditation. Establish the principle. With this, one will not be misled by extraneous opinions. It is based on the knowledge of the mind regarding appearances. Who is the mind that knows appearances? The mind knows suffering. Who is the mind that knows suffering? Think without thinking. This is true thinking. In walking, in sitting, in lying down, do this constantly. With this effort, one will suddenly and completely penetrate. Indeed, there are those who do not understand how this is so.<a id="trans-327p" href="#orig-327p" class="marker">[327p]</a><br/>
Old verses say: Iron chariots shattered the jade stone doors. Jade chickens pecked open golden shells. This news. The elder closed the gate and quietly attained enlightenment. Surely one can attain it oneself. In essence, one measures their own nature. This is the daily practice of the Zen school. When evil comes, goodness can be measured. When ignorance comes, intelligence can be measured. Alms-giving measures greed. Tranquility measures disturbance.<a id="trans-328p" href="#orig-328p" class="marker">[328p]</a><br/>
Named the Six Realms. The Bodhisattva’s arrival in the Dharma world is a matter of confusion for the elder. He sits motionless and cannot sleep. Thus, the pivot of yin and yang cannot interact, with yang floating externally and yin not guarding within. How many are free from illness? To establish the latent yang, it employs two realms, two winters, honeyed gourd, ginseng, apricot seed, attar, congealed gum, woad, tortoise shell, and oyster shell. After simmering, it is mixed with half a bowl of human milk and taken for twenty courses, without needing further adjustments.<a id="trans-329p" href="#orig-329p" class="marker">[329p]</a><br/>
The elders prostrated themselves and departed. After more than twenty days, they returned. It was said that taking two doses of blood would stop it. Now, their spirits are growing stronger each day. Because of this, they went to the front to gather purple ivy, apricot kernels, and goji berries. Taking these remedies made them stronger than before. From then on, they sat in meditation and experienced no suffering.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Way is non-action. Do not become attached to appearances. If you step into a sticky place, you immediately fall into the illusionary barrier. One should be cautious of this.<br/>

Case Record, Volume Two: The Case of Gu Qu Fang’s Alcohol Consumption and Hemorrhage.<br/>
<br/>
Gu Qu Fang, proprietor of the Clear and Harmonious Shop in Wulin, consumed alcohol and bled.<a id="trans-330p" href="#orig-330p" class="marker">[330p]</a><br/>
Having suffered from bleeding for more than ten years. The illness originated from excessive drinking. The blood was excessively hot and unrestrained. While various medicines were haphazardly administered, the flesh became thin and phlegm abundant, accompanied by chills and palpitations. His mind and awareness were as if in a trance. He self-diagnosed a cold constitution and recklessly used medicines that generated heat, scattering forty or so different herbs. There were no principal or supporting herbs to guide the treatment. He feared a deficiency of heat and therefore prepared ginger juice and simmered it for consumption, yet the chills worsened.<a id="trans-331p" href="#orig-331p" class="marker">[331p]</a><br/>
Though seated within the heavy curtains, I found the slightest breeze most disagreeable. My heart was empty and fearful. I constantly feared the roof would collapse and crush me to death. The place was crowded with people, and I also disliked the noise and disturbance. It was the autumn of the tenth day of the twelfth lunar month. He examined my illness. My cough and wheezing were due to the reversing of the vital energy, my pulse was weak and rapid, reaching seven or eight times per minute. This was undoubtedly caused by the large, hot medicines I had taken previously, which had aggravated the heat and consumed the essence of gold.<a id="trans-332p" href="#orig-332p" class="marker">[332p]</a><br/>
The lungs were already injured. The heat, having reached its extreme, manifested as a cold condition. The illness was gravely critical. One attempted to employ the method of nurturing yin with sweet and cold substances—namely, half a pint of pounded fresh poplar root, sweet osmanthus pear, lotus root, fresh earth heart, and wheat germ barley each. These were mixed into a pint of human milk, and consumed slowly over an hour. This was a remedy used when there was no other recourse. Upon taking it, the patient felt somewhat relieved. However, the condition worsened after it was subsequently treated, and he died in the spring.<br/>

<br/>
Recorded by Mr. Zhang Tiaomai of Changtang. Over forty years of age. Experienced in treating hemorrhage.<a id="trans-333p" href="#orig-333p" class="marker">[333p]</a><br/>
In the ninth month of the Ding-hai year, at the altar of the Ta-shuei god in Wu-shan, a consultation was held. The spirit was listless. The pulse was thin, fine, and slow, exactly as described by Zhong-jing. The male patient was losing blood and semen, and the female patient was experiencing premature labor and lochia. I said, “Examine the pulse and assess the symptoms. One should treat with blood-loss. Agreed.” I said, “This illness is caused by the strength of wood and the weakness of earth. The liver governs the storage of blood, and the spleen governs the circulation of blood.”<a id="trans-334p" href="#orig-334p" class="marker">[334p]</a><br/>
Now the wood of the liver is excessively loose and deficient in its release; therefore, the blood will not be contained within and will leak downward. I Feng said that prolonged bleeding lasts for several years, with several lines appearing each day. The vital energy is like being poured out. Afterwards, it became even more difficult to endure. The waist and buttocks ached and were painful, the lower abdomen was distended urgently, and movement caused the vital energy to reverse. To sit or lie down, one had to raise the foot to feel better. The form resembled a hunched and bent person. I said, “This strange pulse is the cause of the illness.”<a id="trans-335p" href="#orig-335p" class="marker">[335p]</a><br/>
Beside the navel, named the Lesser Belly. This is the course of the converging channels. The督脉 (Dūmài –督脉) runs along the back and lumbar region. It weaves through the waist and buttocks, entering the midline, and forms the belt channel. The converging channels are prone to illness. When the converging channels reverse their flow within the body, the vital energy is rushed inward, causing rapid symptoms. The督脉 (Dūmài –督脉) is also an illness. When the督脉 (Dūmài –督脉) is deficient, the spine cannot be held upright, and the buttocks substitute for the head, and the spine substitutes for the head.<a id="trans-336p" href="#orig-336p" class="marker">[336p]</a><br/>
All diseases appeared as if painted. All the meridians of the *Qìngjīng* were brightened by the liver and kidneys. The prescription consisted of returning, *sháoqiáo*, *chuándàn*, ginseng, goji berries, rhinoceros horn glue, beggar’s buckwheat, tortoise shell, oyster shell, angelica, fennel, star anise, white bellflower, and mu dan pills three portions. It was decocted and administered in the Jìshēng pills with black plum in three portions, for several courses to stop bleeding. Afterwards, it was reduced, and then removed star anise, white bellflower, mu dan pills, and added items of blood and flesh to strengthen the meridians. It was sometimes made into a decoction, sometimes into a paste, and was applied to many illnesses, resulting in gradual recovery. Only the ascending qi from the upper abdomen of the kidneys was the root of the problem.<a id="trans-337p" href="#orig-337p" class="marker">[337p]</a><br/>
As the case was presented in a report. After cauterizing the central palace. Guan Yuan, Shi Men. It was treated for two months and recovered. All cases of odd pulse deficiencies invariably required the use of blood and flesh with vitality. This was effective. *Nei Jing* says that when the essence is deficient, it should be supplemented with taste. Regarding cauterization, it is particularly advisable to hold the intention of the Three Traces in mind.<a id="trans-338p" href="#orig-338p" class="marker">[338p]</a><br/>
Everyday his body was exceedingly robust and powerfully built. His frame was large and imposing. In the winter of the fifth year of the Wei Dynasty, he suffered from urinary obstruction for half a year or more, and it gradually healed. The urine was difficult to excrete in drops. His vital energy constantly flowed downwards. The distension was sudden and threatened death. He was forced to go to the Western medicine practitioner and used a suction tube to extract it, several times a day, which he considered his normal condition. He delayed seeking the advice of the physician for a long time. The pulse at the two cun points was extremely deficient and enlarged; the pulse at the two chi was fine and rough, lacking harmony.<a id="trans-339p" href="#orig-339p" class="marker">[339p]</a><br/>
I said this illness is due to deficiency of the middle and emptiness of the clear yang descending. Initially, it manifests like the symptoms of a blind man’s closure. The physician administers aged earthwort, cinnamon, prepared sweet flag, and supplements. Then the descending emptiness gradually improves. The orifices of the lower channels become blocked. Consequently, the urine is difficult to excrete. The name of the illness shifts to “disruption of the fetus.” Its treatment is exceedingly easy. Why did it persist for half a year, and why did no one recognize this illness? It is truly laughable. It is comparable to the “Replenishing Middle and Invigorating Qi” formula.<a id="trans-340p" href="#orig-340p" class="marker">[340p]</a><br/>
Yellow Reuso used one or two ounces of yellow powder. He added three *qian* (small measures) of sandalwood. He used one-third of *gua* (cinnamon). Two doses brought about slight relief. Four doses made the illness appear as if the body had lost its essence. Afterwards, he used a formula to strengthen the center and benefit vital energy. He did not add drugs with diuretic properties. He repeatedly instructed the patient to eat a small number of pork trotters daily. He used them to replenish the reproductive organs. Feeling sympathy for similar cases brought about peace. The previous disturbances, which had lasted half a month, were now resolved. The patient considered it miraculous. In reality, it was simply treating the illness according to its symptoms.<a id="trans-341p" href="#orig-341p" class="marker">[341p]</a><br/>
What is strange. Alas. These are the writings of Jin-kui. They are meticulously recorded. The imperial palace is exceedingly vast. How few physicians there are! It is truly worthy of lamentation. <br/>

Mrs. Sun of Hong Kong Foot entered the abdomen; treatment proved effective.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Sun of Hong Kong Foot Lane. Both feet swelled from the跗 (fǔ –跗 refers to the foot or ankle) to the root; heat and pain were severe. The skin was flushed and bright. By night, she suffered convulsions. I examined her. The pulse was heavy and tight.<a id="trans-342p" href="#orig-342p" class="marker">[342p]</a><br/>
I said, this is a case of foot-entering the belly. It is also a dangerous condition. Shocking the heart leads to death. When there are afflictions on the foot’s meridians, they are all pierced and bled. And the Wei point is also pierced. Then, I administered Chicken Cry Powder, instructing the patient to take it when the fifth rooster crows. Externally, I used a soup of silkworm dung and medicinal herbs to cleanse the wound.<br/>
<br/>
The next evening, the patient did not collapse with heat and pain, and the symptoms persisted. Then, I used betel nut, silkworm dung, Chinese fir bark, pawpaw, powdered turmeric, yellow chrysanthemum, talc, and mung beans, and it was cured.<br/>

Wang Liang’s Patient – A Successful Treatment<br/>
<br/>
Wang Liang, seventy-seven years old.<a id="trans-343p" href="#orig-343p" class="marker">[343p]</a><br/>
The lower body was heavy and burdensome. Pain prevented movement. It was the tenth day of the seventh month. Zhao Yu examined it. His pulse in all six divisions was large and hollow. I diagnosed this as a condition caused by the invasion of cold dampness. Treatment should focus on strengthening the root and correcting imbalances, without excessive damp-seeping. I then used *san*, *ling*, *shu*, *cao*, *gui*, *shao*, *ni xi*, *mu gua*, *yi yi*, *fang ji* etc. It was taken in several courses. The illness did not improve or worsen. One physician advised inducing sweating. He administered *ma huang*, *qiang huo*, *chuan xiong* etc. The sweat flowed out like rain.<a id="trans-344p" href="#orig-344p" class="marker">[344p]</a><br/>
That night, he closed his eyes and suddenly awoke in alarm. He felt an emptiness within his heart, as if nothing existed. The next day, he again felt his body light. He felt as if wings were growing at his armpits, desiring to fly and leap to high places. His family was alarmed and bewildered, and the physician also summoned him, examining his hands and feet, which danced wildly. His strength was great, and it seemed as if he would climb onto the roof. <br/>
<br/>
Two or three people grasped him, and only then could he be calmed. Examining his pulse, the vital points of the cun and guan were floating upwards, extending upwards by several feet, and he was particularly agitated. I said, “This is due to excessive sweating and the yang rising upwards; one must not rush to remedy it, otherwise it will cause madness.”<a id="trans-345p" href="#orig-345p" class="marker">[345p]</a><br/>
He recovered immediately by following that method. He used prepared ginseng, aconite, charred sweet flag (gan cao), each three *qian* (units of weight), five-flavor fungus (wu wei zi) one *qian*, prepared white peony (sheng bai shao) and snow ear (mai dong) each eight *qian*, lo Hanu (shou di) four *liang* (ounces), and cast iron filings two *liang*. The decoction was prepared by substituting with boiled water. After taking the medicine, he slept for three or four hours. Upon waking, his pulse was slowed, his spirit calmed, and his body still felt heavy with pain. I said, “This illness is difficult to cure; one can only hope to prolong it for many years. Formerly, Xu Hui’s Creek was afflicted with this illness and did not die from it, but if he recovered, he would certainly die. This is of the same type. I then showed him the prescriptions of experienced physicians, and he followed them. Afterwards, he nourished his vital energy and blood.”<a id="trans-346p" href="#orig-346p" class="marker">[346p]</a><br/>
The vital energy of the stomach is gradually strengthening. The pulse is also in harmony. However, the illness originating from below the body could not be cured.<br/>

Case of Zhao Lao Tai’s Sun Deficiency Fever Treatment<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Zhong-Weng’s elderly wife, this year eighty-two years old, had been married to Zhao Zhong-Weng for two years. Her body was slightly out of balance. She immediately summoned Zhao Zhao Yu to treat her. After taking two doses of medicine, she was invariably cured. Suddenly, one evening she developed a severe fever and labored breathing.<br/>
<br/>
Zhao Zhao Yu then examined her. The two cun (measure of distance) and three chi (measure of distance) pulses were both greatly elevated and numerous. The two chi pulses were extremely deficient.<a id="trans-347p" href="#orig-347p" class="marker">[347p]</a><br/>
I observed that the yang energy was rising excessively. The true essence was about to depart. If a large amount of sweat were to emerge, there would be a sudden concern about violent discharge. Therefore, I administered a large dose of Sheng Mai Drink, mixed with Zhu (cinnabar powder), Puzhin (Ligusticum) and Dang Gui (Angelica) each four chi (approximately 1.875 cm), plus Shu Han (Stellate Granules), Longchi (Dragon Bone) each three chi (approximately 5.625 cm), and Oysters one Liang (approximately 37.5 grams) taken at once, whereupon the fever subsided and he became calm. The following day, he was re-examined. The pulse and vital energy were immediately restrained, and there was also a root sensation in the two脇 (two脇 –脇 refers to the side, flank) areas which caused pain. Therefore, I changed to a lighter prescription for nourishing blood, opening the liver, and regulating the channels. The prescription consisted of Su梗 (Corydalis root) and Jue Luo (Citrus Peel) each eight fen (approximately 1.333 cm), Xiang Fu (Chinese Angelica Root) and Chai Hu (Ligusticum Root) each five fen (approximately 0.833 cm).<a id="trans-348p" href="#orig-348p" class="marker">[348p]</a><br/>
Three pieces of *gui zhī*. Two *gui zhī* plus two *gui zhī* plus two *gui zhī* plus two *gui zhī* plus two *gui zhī*. Also, six pieces of *shí hú* and six pieces of *jí lǐ*. Administer two courses of treatment and it will be cured. A loyal gentleman always said that my prescription was too heavy. It is like that of Wu and Yue and not suitable for such cases. I replied, the size of a prescription should be determined by the severity of the illness and the patient’s constitution; it cannot be judged by a single example.<a id="trans-349p" href="#orig-349p" class="marker">[349p]</a><br/>
What can make the heat recede and be at ease? Today the liver and blood are not in harmony. The method should be lightly stimulated. If one heavily uses *chai hu* and *gui zhi* etc., then the true yang will rise again, but the vital energy will also ascend beyond. Therefore, yesterday one had to do it heavily, and today one must do it lightly. Furthermore, I am in Hangzhou, and when treating illnesses, one often encounters dangerous cases, yet one cannot do otherwise. In short, one must be realistic and truthful, and when one correctly diagnoses the illness, it is a legitimate course of action.<a id="trans-350p" href="#orig-350p" class="marker">[350p]</a><br/>
As habit dictates, one should proceed with caution. One may encounter serious illness. One should temporarily neglect matters of ease. Knowing this and not acting upon it – is that what he intended? Or did he simply allow himself to be ridiculed and exhausted in pursuit of his own desires? Formerly, Su Cheng, a distinguished scholar, excelled in both literature and economics, rising to prominence. He possessed a vast store of opinions unsuitable for the times. How could one possibly satisfy such a person? I have only superficially studied medical principles, remaining within the boundaries of established thought, and there were few who could withstand his criticism. The ancients said, “Can it be done as others wish?”<a id="trans-351p" href="#orig-351p" class="marker">[351p]</a><br/>
But I only seek to not disgrace my heart.<br/>
Volume Two, Medical Cases<br/>
Again the following year, the body was weak and afflicted with illness, with its treatment recorded.<br/>
Again the following year, the affliction was blood deficiency and excess phlegm. Pain in the limbs and waist and back. The body was difficult to turn sideways. Eventually, a slight chill was felt. Immediately, the breath became rapid and the spirit confused. The family was all greatly alarmed. In the second month, because of changing clothes and being chilled, Chu Yu examined him. He was strong in vigor and heat, but his spirit was confused. His mouth opened, his breath was rapid, and all six pulse positions were sluggish and full.<a id="trans-352p" href="#orig-352p" class="marker">[352p]</a><br/>
The patient was large and numerous with symptoms. I deeply understood his usual bodily constitution. Lightly prescribed monthflower, angelica root, fragrant honeysuckle, ligusticum root, apricot kernel, scallion bulb, gardenia root, rhubarb, peony root, mu dan pi, vitex root, and bamboo fiber. These were combined with medications to fortify the surface. After the patient took them, a porridge soup was given to cover and draw out slight perspiration, thereby curing the condition. One dose, administered in this manner, resulted in complete recovery. This was a method of treating illness by abandoning pulse diagnosis and symptom diagnosis, relying instead on the patient’s original bodily constitution. I once observed a person suffering from a fever, whose underlying imbalance was mild. The physician habitually discharged excessive heat, causing the sweat to cease, and the vital energy to rise to the surface, leading to chest tightness and death.<a id="trans-353p" href="#orig-353p" class="marker">[353p]</a><br/>
It cannot be counted sufficiently. Like the case of Wang Liang, the old man, it resulted from deficiency of vital essence and failure of perspiration, leading to perilous symptoms and outbreaks of fever. It should not be regarded as a person of illusion, and its teachings regarding the avoidance of perspiration should not be followed.<br/>

A wealthy woman’s winter-heat-sweating syndrome. Within鄂记绸庄 (Oke Ji Chou Zhuang – Oke Ji Silk Estate), the woman, aged ten years, suffered from winter-heat-sweating in the tenth month. For ten days, she did not respond to treatment; physicians either applied heat or attempted to dry her, but they failed.<a id="trans-354p" href="#orig-354p" class="marker">[354p]</a><br/>
He became involved with the Yang Ming sect. There was intense heat and shortness of breath. His body was flushed with white. The rash was mixed with it. I examined his pulse, which was sluggish and indistinct. I prescribed the Yang Ming method of penetrating and clearing, using ingredients such as antelope horn, manchineel root, forsythia, Chinese privet, seedpod of Chinese bellflower, and silver flower. The following morning, he urgently requested a visit. I went immediately and found that the rash had subsided, the stool had been relieved, and the heat and reverse sweating were particularly severe.<a id="trans-355p" href="#orig-355p" class="marker">[355p]</a><br/>
He examined his pulse, large and empty. His face was red, as if painted. I said, “This is the evil; let it depart and the right be freed with it.” Prescribe prepared ginseng, prepared *shengfu* (life-restoring herb) each three *qian* (units of weight), prepared licorice root and prepared ginger each one *qian*. Also, prescribe *wǔwèi zǐ* (five-flavor powder) in one-fifth portion. Immediately order them to brew and drink it, without delay. I instructed his heir: “When it is the ninth hour to the seventh hour, a great sweat will emerge; at that time, the yang will be lost. Take advantage of this moment before sweating, and it can still be saved.” They discussed this with another physician.<a id="trans-356p" href="#orig-356p" class="marker">[356p]</a><br/>
He did not believe it. The exchange of the Han fruit was exceedingly abundant. He began to believe that my words were not mistaken.<br/>

Concerning the cure for the Sun Family’s Chronic Disorder<br/>
<br/>
Sun Mou, residing in the Wu Lin Yun Qi (Clouding Bamboo Grove) family. He possessed a stout physique and habitually enjoyed rich, sweet foods. He was approaching sixty years of age and suffered from chronic disorder. His left hand was unable to move and his feet were similarly afflicted. Approaching his seventy years.<a id="trans-357p" href="#orig-357p" class="marker">[357p]</a><br/>
The spirit was confused and the breath was short. The stool did not pass. The head and eyes were dizzy. It was like a feverish illness. He invited me to examine him. The pulse on the right side was large and slippery with many beats. The pulse on the left side was firm and small in all three beats. The wrist pulse was slightly like spider silk. I said, “The right pulse is large and slippery, due to phlegm and food stagnation obstructing the channels. The left pulse is firm and small, due to deficiency of vital energy and blood.”<a id="trans-358p" href="#orig-358p" class="marker">[358p]</a><br/>
There is no means of gaining honor through nourishing the meridians. It moistens and strengthens the sinews and bones. If the left does not rise, the right does not descend. Its vital energy and blood converge on one side, resulting in a condition of localized dryness. Sometimes there is confusion of the spirit and a rapid flow of breath. This is caused by phlegm following the rising of qi, with the lung qi unable to descend. The method should be to eliminate the accumulated phlegm and transform it, drawing the right with the left, the yin with the yang, and the yang with the yin.<a id="trans-359p" href="#orig-359p" class="marker">[359p]</a><br/>
Regulate the flow of qi and blood. There was no stagnation throughout the body. Then prescribe dan shen, gui pi, shao hu, sheng ma. Assist in elevating the qi and blood to the left. Use lu zhi, bing lao, mu xiang, ban xia, zhi shi. Eliminate phlegm and dampness descending to the right. Take three courses of treatment, and the hands and feet became raised. Stools were relieved. Diet was also increased. Vertigo ceased.<br/>
<br/>
Subsequently, prescribe shen, ling, gui pi sao, ban xia, chen pi, dan shen, sheng ma, chai hu, ma ren, sang zhi, etc., to adjust it. Instruct him to eat in the morning and reduce his diet in the afternoon. Avoid greasy and rich flavors.<a id="trans-360p" href="#orig-360p" class="marker">[360p]</a><br/>
To nourish the stomach and clear the tranquil air within. This prevents the obstruction of turbidity by hindering the flow of vital energy. Taken four to five courses. Subsequently, he descended to the lower levels and resumed his journey. His steps were normal. Afterwards, he used ginseng, and other herbs like *gui* (greater mulbery) and *shao* (licorice) to strengthen qi and blood. Combined with items that dispel phlegm and invigorate the pulse. Thirty courses were taken, and the illness was cured completely. How joyous! The dwelling was in Mei Jia Wu, thirty or so miles from Hangzhou. He meditated in the morning, departed in the evening, and returned in the morning. I was with him at that time.<a id="trans-361p" href="#orig-361p" class="marker">[361p]</a><br/>
It was reported that his illness was grave. Several days later, Yi Fang’s son arrived to reside and change the prescription. He was overjoyed. After the physician’s examination, there was a significant improvement. There was no longer the suffering of a half-body becoming withered. The feet were clearly upright. Lively and vibrant. It evoked the thought of the Yellow Emperor’s palace.<br/>

However, upon careful consideration, the cause lies in excessive blood flow, resulting in the neglect of my sinews and muscles. These afflictions are associated with the Kidney Channel.

His lips and face were both pale blue. He pressed tightly on his chest, and the pain was unbearable, he could not speak. The pulse at the left side of his wrist was firm. The vital point at the bottom of his chest felt like a knife being drawn. His right hand could not examine him. This was because he was pressing tightly on his chest.

Though Lu Bian has been reborn, it cannot be saved. The time is too late. The fruit of the soldier is rotten. Volume Two, Medical Cases. The Treatment and Experience of Zhao Zhong-Weng’s High Yang Syndrome in Old Age. Zhao Zhong-Weng previously suffered from intermittent pain in the left cheek and along the meridians before and after the ear. I cured it. There were occasional minor eruptions for three years. When adjusted, it was effective. On the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, I examined his pulse, it was two chi thick and smooth with a floating sensation. Frequent urination, painful blockage of the urinary channel, unable to sleep at night. I said, “This is a condition caused by high yang in old age.”<a id="trans-366p" href="#orig-366p" class="marker">[366p]</a><br/>
The old man, Tian Bing, was exceedingly fervent. He was over eighty years old. He had no female companions outside the home. Consequently, at the time of sexual arousal, he urinated. Because of this, he rose from his bed. The *Nei Jing* says, “Thoughts are boundless; desires unfulfilled. The mind plays with sexual fantasies, and then manifests white impotence.” He used sweet and cool medicines to nourish his essence, supplemented with ginseng, pine nuts, and *Chadan* (a herbal mixture) to dispel kidney fire. After taking several courses, he gradually recovered.<a id="trans-367p" href="#orig-367p" class="marker">[367p]</a><br/>

Detailed account of Li Feng’s illness, with a change in his yang pulse into true essence, leading to a severe decline.<br/>
Li Lizheng and Li Feng. They had a long-standing problem of phlegm and fire. He would summon the doctor to examine him, and the doctor would invariably be fortunate enough to find him. He had a previous illness that recurred in the ninth month.<a id="trans-368p" href="#orig-368p" class="marker">[368p]</a><br/>
He palpated his pulse. It had always been abnormally large. Now, suddenly, it was diminished and small. The superficial pulse was fluctuating, its count becoming unclear. Furthermore, the vital energy ceased and did not return continuously. He stared, and said to his elder brother, Mei Sheng, a historian, “The pulse of the young master, what has caused it to be so irregular?” Mei Sheng, a skilled practitioner of medicine, deeply believed in the logic of his brother’s pulse, and he was filled with doubt for a long time before finally saying, “Is there no serious harm?”<br/>
<a id="trans-369p" href="#orig-369p" class="marker">[369p]</a><br/>
He dared not report it directly. It was a prescription for clearing the stagnation of the upper burner. He added Jin Kui Shen Qi Wan. Taking it brought some relief. He examined him several days later. Elder Feng asked about the pulse. I earnestly tried to comfort him. In desperation, I privately told Mr. Mei, “The pulse symptoms have manifested as the true vital energy declining, like a sparrow pecking at food. It occurs every five or six times, or occasionally ten or eleven times, stopping at one. I fear this is a sign of the Great Yang’s excessive decline. What should be done?”<a id="trans-370p" href="#orig-370p" class="marker">[370p]</a><br/>
Old Master Mei prescribed this formula for calming agitation. It combines the Gui Ling Gan Shu Tang (Cinnamon, Rice Flour, Licorice, and Saposh) with Long Mu (Dragon Horn and Sheep Horn) to subdue restlessness. Furthermore, he devised two formulas for treating phlegm in the upper Jiao (chest and upper abdomen). These formulas utilized eight taels of Chen Pi (dried orange peel), two taels each of Sangshu (acacia bark) and Hansha (dried anis root), five *qian* (small measures) of Fengwa Niao (magnesium nitrate) and Qingyan (sodium chloride), and half a bowl of fresh ginger juice. These ingredients were combined into a decoction, then mixed with the ginger juice and incorporated into the dried orange peel. Patients were instructed to take a small amount of this mixture frequently, holding it in their mouth and swallowing it. This was prescribed for treating emptiness in the lower Jiao (lower abdomen and intestines). The formula utilized five *qian* of Renshen (Panax ginseng) and eight *qian* of Sheng Fu Zi (dried Atractylodes rhizome). The Sheng Fu Zi was decocted in water, and the resulting juice was mixed with the Renshen. The Renshen was then cut into small pieces using a copper knife.<a id="trans-371p" href="#orig-371p" class="marker">[371p]</a><br/>
Outer application of powdered茯苓. Mixed with molten honey to form pills. Sun-dried. Taken daily on an empty stomach, three chi (units of volume). The elder Nai forbade the use of ginseng and ephedra. The elder Mei repeatedly urged him, eventually weeping and pleading, but he could not be persuaded. The physician ordered the use of ginseng in five chi to test it. There was a feeling of distention in the abdomen. He was even more cautious. I said, “Ginseng is different from ginseng; only five chi should be taken.”<a id="trans-372p" href="#orig-372p" class="marker">[372p]</a><br/>
It is used for swelling. It can be taken in five *qian* (small measures). Immediately after, the swelling ceased. Moreover, the preparations made by the foolish one, consisting of *pan* (pinewood resin) and *zhu* (piper), are made into pills. These are applied externally, wrapped in *fu ling* (poria), and placed into the stomach, so that the nature of *pan* and *zhu* will certainly manifest in the lower abdomen. This lower abdomen’s vital energy can be utilized to provide warmth and strengthen it, thereby turning it vigorous. And the damp evil in the middle abdomen, how difficult is it to drive it out and exhaust it? It cannot possibly cause swelling. Red heart, bitter mouth, the intention does not return. Simply asked, can the small children enter the capital next year?<a id="trans-373p" href="#orig-373p" class="marker">[373p]</a><br/>
I said, the illness has not yet been cured. Mei Weng will certainly not cease his temporary departure from his grandchildren. This is what I have learned and understood. Mei Weng wept with tears streaming down his face. I could not bear to lament. The life of the Master was characterized by the most compassionate and loving nature, delighting in kindness and never wearying. He had a special connection with me. Alas.

I said, this illness is exceedingly dangerous. It must not be disregarded. I gave it to you a certain amount of *Chan Qian* pills for stopping swelling. Instruct you to take five *qian* daily. Come visit me tomorrow. The hardened mass will be completely gone. The illness will be as if it never existed. I was greatly astonished. I said, “I still have the *Yu Su* pills.

He administered the medicine to me and observed it. Only a few remained. Then he took it repeatedly for over ten hours. Each time he took twenty to thirty grains. Having finished taking it. I said, “Fortunately my body grew strong. Otherwise, I would have been involved in a serious matter. However, if the sores and poisons remained hard and swollen without diminishing, this pill alone would surely prove effective, like a divine remedy. Even after the pus had formed, it was unnecessary to cut it open; it would naturally break through and expel the poison.

The nuclei within the skin were like bullets, partially exposed and partially embedded within the flesh.<a id="trans-378p" href="#orig-378p" class="marker">[378p]</a><br/>
I said, this illness exhibits both color and pulse indicating deficiency and coldness. It requires immediate treatment with warming and nourishing of qi and blood. If not treated properly, it will prolong the illness, resulting in chronic fatigue. I then prescribed *Rong Yang Tang* (Warm Yang Decoction) with added deer horn glue, administering it for over ten courses, and the wound gradually became red and alive. The core remained undissolved. I then continued with *Qian Fang* (Front Pill), and also used *Dong Tian Jiu Ku Dan* (Dong Tian Rescue Pain Pills) and *Xiao Jin Dan* (Small Golden Pills), taking them intermittently, for thirty-five days.<a id="trans-379p" href="#orig-379p" class="marker">[379p]</a><br/>
Its core became pus. It gradually flowed away. Those not broken also gradually dissipated. Then, powdered living skin was applied, together with ginseng and agaric. A paste of Yang and Resolving Congestion ointment was applied as a plaster. Simultaneously, the Living Skin Nourishing Blood and Strengthening the Spleen Pill was continued. Within two months, it healed. The person also became strong and robust. This was the method of Wang Hongxiu. Physicians widely used descending dan (drugs) to extract the core. Pain must not be endured; it cannot be cured. Therefore, it is treated for sores, ulcers, and other diseases.<a id="trans-380p" href="#orig-380p" class="marker">[380p]</a><br/>
To not experience pain is the most wondrous method. This is the treatment for this condition. The nodules are numerous. The treatments themselves are all different. One must diligently observe the symptoms in daily practice to have a firm grasp of the situation.<br/>

Volume Two, Medical Cases<br/>
<br/>
Two Cases: The Appearance of the True Organs Foretells Death; The Case of Ning County’s Chen Yangsheng.<a id="trans-381p" href="#orig-381p" class="marker">[381p]</a><br/>
I privately said to a friend of mine, “Observe my color; my death is near.” He said, “What do you see?” I said, “The *Nei Jing* says, ‘The large bones become dry and cracked, the large flesh collapses downward, the air in the chest becomes full and labored with breathing, the hair becomes withered and pale, and one dies in winter.’ Now my appearance exactly matches what is described in the *Nei Jing*; can it be avoided?”<a id="trans-382p" href="#orig-382p" class="marker">[382p]</a><br/>
First, he became rich, then he grew greedy. It was called losing focus. There was no longer any method of treatment. As a result, he died in winter.<br/>
A hermit named Qian Shicheng was at the temple of Ningbo. He set up an inkstone under the southern end of the east corridor. A scholar named Xu Junrui was under the east corridor. He claimed to have thoroughly read the *Ma Yi* (a collection of ancient texts). On that day, I saw Qian’s face yellow and withered, with a sickly green vapor like smoke. I said to Xu, “You are a scholar; you must be able to know a person’s lifespan. Therefore, Qian can only live a few more years.”<a id="trans-383p" href="#orig-383p" class="marker">[383p]</a><br/>
Xu Tieguan observed and said, “The reflection of the illness appears for two or three years. I replied, ‘I do not know the nature of the illness. I merely observe the color present at this time. The *Nei Jing* says, ‘Yellow is like the hardness of the bark of the wild jujube tree; it leads to death. The hair withers and the color becomes sickly, dying in autumn.’ This indicates a deficiency of the vital energy of the intestines and stomach. This person will certainly die from a fever of diarrhea and dysentery during the autumn season. It was caused by the great fire in the west in July and August, which melted stone and produced gold; this caused the lung energy to become even more deficient.’”<a id="trans-384p" href="#orig-384p" class="marker">[384p]</a><br/>
The lungs and the large intestine are like the interior and exterior. And Yang Ming’s earth and gold release vital energy. This is undoubtedly a certain death. The consequences should be as I have said. Whenever one judges a person’s life or death by observing their appearance, one must examine their vital energy. For color is a sign, and vital energy is the root. If color is withered but still possesses vital energy, it indicates the illness is not yet severe enough to cause death.<br/>
<br/>
If both color and vital energy are utterly decayed, like the dark and dismal haze of smoke, the time of death can be determined. Therefore, a physician must…<a id="trans-385p" href="#orig-385p" class="marker">[385p]</a><br/>
Let me not study the *Inner Canon*. Volume Two, Medical Cases. Cases of True Organs Diagnosed Pre-Mortally. Year of the Rooster. I was in Ning. A man from Wenzhou, Mr. Bian, was examined. Approximately forty years of age. I cut his pulse, the superficial part being greatly deficient and expansive, like lard on the surface of a dish. After prolonged pressing, it resembled the movement of fish leaping and swimming. I asked him if he had previously bled. He said no. Then, did his chest and throat ache? He said no. I asked him what his true suffering was. He said that recently his limbs had felt somewhat heavy and swollen.<a id="trans-386p" href="#orig-386p" class="marker">[386p]</a><br/>
Luckily, my appetite was quite good. I experienced no trouble. I said, “To have such a pulse without illness is extraordinary. There is much to consider. My limbs are heavy with dampness, but it is merely a minor ailment, and yet my appetite remains good. What illness could there be? You should appreciate my wisdom. I will not prescribe a remedy. You, Lady Fang, smiled and departed. Afterwards, I heard from a friend that she had gone to visit him for a midday drink.”<a id="trans-387p" href="#orig-387p" class="marker">[387p]</a><br/>
One night, he felt his head heavy. He attributed it to excessive drinking. He extinguished the lamp and went to sleep. The next day, the sun was high but he did not rise. His companions calling him did not elicit a response. He used his hand to push him, and he had already stiffened. It is recorded that a sickness of the pulse is different from illness, and is called “wandering corpse.” A person who has no serious illness will not show the true pulse of the organs. This is because the vital energy of the internal organs has been depleted for a long time, and it is most important to pay close attention to it.<br/>
<br/>
It should not be lightly treated by a physician.<a id="trans-388p" href="#orig-388p" class="marker">[388p]</a><br/>
Perhaps after taking medicine, the illness worsened and manifested severely, inevitably leading to blame directed at the physician. How regrettable this is. Furthermore, there was a female servant in the household of Mr. Lu of Hangyuan, a native of Shao County, over fifty years of age, with a protrusion above her pelvic bone, and a sore on her waist that had festered for a long time without healing.<a id="trans-389p" href="#orig-389p" class="marker">[389p]</a><br/>
All floated, grasped at emptiness, vast. Deeply pressing, without roots. I knew this was incurable. Therefore, I instructed the man of enlightened intent to use gentle words to urge him to rest. After recovery, he could return. The female servant spoke as she went home. The physician treated him until autumn, when he seemed somewhat settled, but then returned. The man of enlightened intent again invited me to examine his pulse, which was as it had been at first. I said that the pulse still had no roots; one must guard against excessive heat and cold. Consequently, he died in the early winter.<br/>
<br/>
Formerly, Master Zhong of Hang Jun Pu said that worldly physicians could kill, but could not revive the dead.<a id="trans-390p" href="#orig-390p" class="marker">[390p]</a><br/>
If one can truly understand that it will certainly die, even if one cannot move it, it will certainly not cause death. Since its origin lies in not causing death, its vitality can be seen flowing from between the fingers. Remembering the former magistrate of Zhuchuan, I observed him to have mastered all knowledge, with medicine and Daoism being particularly emphasized. Whenever a case was incurable, he would meticulously examine the five elements and six energies, and determine the time of life and death. Reading the True Organ Case files, one cannot help but feel a sense of grief for the departed father.<a id="trans-391p" href="#orig-391p" class="marker">[391p]</a><br/>
Xú Sòngqiāo said, “The treatments prescribed for the various illnesses within this imperial court are not comparable to ordinary, easily-achieved remedies. Furthermore, they are administered according to established laws, without any attempt at self-aggrandizement. This is the reason they can be transmitted and passed down. The initial concept of ‘Heart Meditation’ was like a substance covering the moon; I dared not reveal it to the world. I urged it to be attempted again. ‘Heart Meditation’ began on the following day, with the jade being offered as collateral by the righteous official. Though I myself was ignorant of medicine, I had from childhood been well-versed in the teachings of the court.”<a id="trans-392p" href="#orig-392p" class="marker">[392p]</a><br/>
Having studied the *Readings of the *Lingshu* and *Su Wen*, along with numerous other texts. He possessed a certain understanding of medical principles. Observing his arguments, he relentlessly pursued the root causes. His investigations were exceedingly complex. He truly deserved to be considered a stepping stone for entering medicine. Through diligent searching and contemplation, he derived knowledge from illness and verified it. His prescriptions were largely comparable to the great works of today. He did not yield to them. I merely made slight corrections, and presented them to him with pears and dates. “Is this not a significant undertaking?” He lamented. I had a region distant a thousand miles from the province, possessing a remarkable feature.<a id="trans-393p" href="#orig-393p" class="marker">[393p]</a><br/>
Meeting by chance through circumstance. Having discussed with him for more than two months regarding meditation. Surely this is the number predetermined. Formerly, Yuan Jianzhai, a respected scholar, stated that the two words “cause and effect” within Buddhism were his most deeply held beliefs. I, too, upon considering this matter, could not help but suddenly understand.<br/>
<br/>
Postscript:<br/>
Studying Buddhism does not involve grasping the ultimate truth. A physician cannot grasp the fundamental principle. Once the mind is relaxed, there is no need to add to it. The heart is like a luminous pearl within, and the mirror reflects it. Reading the ancient scriptures of emperors leads to a sincere aspiration.<a id="trans-394p" href="#orig-394p" class="marker">[394p]</a><br/>
Once, I rejoiced, and all things followed the flow of cause and effect. I carved insects and fish, leaned upon the nature of life and death. I gathered herbs and plants, exhausted my spirit. I reflected upon the compassion and mercy of the Buddha. I lowered my head and released you, pitying the suffering of all beings. I used ten fingers to revive people. When the pine smoke burned, the plum blossoms bloomed, the orchid and camellia were picked, their fragrance encircled the sandals.<a id="trans-395p" href="#orig-395p" class="marker">[395p]</a><br/>
The art embodies harmony. Clouds are woven into fabric. It is not comparable to the skill of the Tai Gong. It can be likened to the marvels of the Otter Woman. Purple books are held in the hand of the Buddha. Furthermore, it gathers scriptures from the imperial palace of the Phoenix. Golden chests and jade boxes. It explores treasures within the dragon’s palace. Toothpicks and brocade silks. With these, it examines the six energies, classifies the five elements, meticulously distinguishes yin and yang, and thoroughly consults the annals of the court.<a id="trans-396p" href="#orig-396p" class="marker">[396p]</a><br/>
To open the vessel of heaven and earth. To seize the scales of life and death. The jade disk is distant, the golden needle operates secretly. The pure intention has already reached perfection. The dark pearl quietly seeks. The peach trees are planted in the apricot grove. Cultivation need not rely on tribute and offerings. The tangerines are nourished in the orange spring. Irrigation need not be envied to Du Fan. The skill is manifested in playing the knife. The path is spacious in his maneuvering. The feet are lowered, and the heart follows his desire. It is like a god dwelling in the land of immortals.<a id="trans-397p" href="#orig-397p" class="marker">[397p]</a><br/>
He severed his flesh, this was the way of releasing himself. He fulfilled the wishes of the Bodhisattvas and their relatives. Therefore, he left his mountain to seek enlightenment. Extraordinary characters filled his cart. He entered the world, practicing Zen. He received invitations from successful men. He learned news from lower-level officials. He grasped the principles of skilled artisans. He felt ashamed of his lack of literary talent. He rejoiced in being guided and nurtured with skill. Love me, love me. He traveled to Lake Tai to gain insight into the teachings from the West. He was able to converse with wise people. He crossed the sea to reach the Southern Peak.<a id="trans-398p" href="#orig-398p" class="marker">[398p]</a><br/>
During the seventh year of the Xiling reign of the Emperor, in the middle of the spring season, on the third day of the period of washing clothes at Zhonghua River, Li Yi, from Jinzhou Village, sent his brother, Xu Ji, a woodcutter, to visit the Tiger Forest, and it was inscribed by Hu Lin, a guest.<a id="trans-399p" href="#orig-399p" class="marker">[399p]</a></div>

不知医之为道。利在治症。有是症即有是药。安可弃症不论。而故反其药以治之。倒行逆施。其症不增剧者几何。顾病家每每堕其术中。以为立论既与寻常不同。其必九折肱可知矣。此真庸而大谬者也。甚且易病为难治。难病为易治。试思以难为易。<a id="orig-27p" href="#trans-27p" class="marker">[27p]</a><br/>

则是若夭若寿。皆命主之。何又言命无权耶。既言必生疾病。使之不寿而死。则是生疾病者。亦命主之。岂能使其病而不能使其死耶。既言命之权于是独重。而又必假手于医。以令病轻者重。重者死。则是命之权反出于医之下矣。　　而何言独重耶。<a id="orig-33p" href="#trans-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a><br/>
予谓是不知命。尤不知天。试思天何事不可死人。而乃使救死之医。充此冥使鬼役。则将杀人愈多。而立功愈大乎。窃杀人有功。务如华元之杀曹吉利。浸假济事。诚汉家一勋臣也。乃欲杀而不能杀。可见其权仍操于天命。而断非医者所能夺也。<a id="orig-34p" href="#trans-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a><br/>
故张文端公言吾人一生福命。必不致误死于医手。药纵错投。亦惟多受痛苦而已。此盖儒相持平之论。医家万不得以此借口。适以张庸庸者杀人之胆耳。况此论文义。自相矛盾。如上文言心术不正。害人无算。天每不降之罚。下文言立心诈欺。假药取财。<a id="orig-35p" href="#trans-35p" class="marker">[35p]</a><br/>

屡谏不止。嗣因恶寒头痛。百治罔效。遂邀孟英诊之。孟英认定脉症。确系实热内蕴。非用硝黄犀角大剂峻攻。断不能散其久久固结之邪。且邪气与正气交并。与贼寇之盘踞山谷。倚恃险阻。并有莠民为之内应。而良善亦迫于势而从之。使非雄师大队。<a id="orig-39p" href="#trans-39p" class="marker">[39p]</a><br/>

或曰古今元气不同。古方不可以治今病。二说误尽后学不小。似业医者。可不必深究古法。惟求临症多耳。此医道所以日趋而日下也。盖必先读书。而胸有成见。临症始知用方之变化。若不读书而徒临症。虽多亦奚为哉。况病有虚实。变化万端。<a id="orig-46p" href="#trans-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a><br/>
治有补泻。方不执一。如同一发热。而热有虚实。宜温宜补。宜凉宜泻。不读书何以知彼虚而此实。如大匠之无绳墨。不几伥伥无之耶。学人务须深究古法。循其规矩。而后见病知源。得心应手。盖古人立方之意。<a id="orig-47p" href="#trans-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br/>
即是规矩所在。由规矩而生巧。方为真巧。若眩奇以弄巧。则巧反拙矣。孟子云。大匠使人规矩。不能使人巧。是必先熟规矩。而乃能生巧。予谓学医必先读书。而后临症。此物此志也。　　卷上诸论　　治病当悉未病论　　古云欲知其假。<a id="orig-48p" href="#trans-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br/>
先识其真。若欲治病。必先知未病为要。盖人之脏腑经络气血。原本饮食传导。皆有一定之理。营卫之循行。昼夜有常度。凭腰之上下。而分其清浊。七窍之中。在上受清阳之灌注。在下司浊阴之传导。呼吸应乎开阖。<a id="orig-49p" href="#trans-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br/>
动静分乎阴阳。如脉以四至五至为常。三至二至即为不及。不及则为虚为寒矣。六至七至即为太过。太过则为实为热矣。脉之鼓动应乎肌中。如按之未及于肌而动应皮肤者。即为浮而病应在表。按之肌肉之分。而脉尚未得。必重按至骨。而脉始应者。即应沉而病应在里。<a id="orig-50p" href="#trans-50p" class="marker">[50p]</a><br/>
故必先知平素之脉。而后乃能识病脉。知表里虚实之大纲。而更推之以部位时令。细切何部之独异。则病无遁情矣。故学医者。必须先读内经。是以素问详论脏腑营卫色脉常变。靡不精细。夫常者一定之理变者化机万端。先知一定之常。而能应变化之万端。如治丝而不紊也。<a id="orig-51p" href="#trans-51p" class="marker">[51p]</a><br/>
否则乱绪纷纷。从何而下手耶。　　卷上诸论　　烟痢宜通不宜塞论　　痢之一症。古名滞下。以肠胃之中。先有积滞而后下也。痢乃后人之伪名。先贤论之详矣。今则世俗通称为痢而治痢之法。非通即涩。方书亦复如是。近洋烟入于中国。凡食洋烟而病痢者。名曰烟痢。<a id="orig-52p" href="#trans-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a><br/>
病患先自胆怯。必求峻补速至。医者不知此理。每以漫补止涩而坏事。故不得不辨论之。盖吸烟之大便。每多燥结。平日有五六日一更衣者。有十余日而始一行者。而其所食。未必不与不吸烟者等。则其肠中之积垢。年深月久。可胜道哉。<a id="orig-53p" href="#trans-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a><br/>
故必通之而始安。余亲见一门子某。素有烟癖。瘾且甚大。后因署中事忙。不暇吸食。每以烟泡过瘾。病痢数月。形如骨立。腹痛后重。一医主以下药。下黑粪如羊矢者甚多。视之皆未化之烟泡也。由是遂愈。<a id="orig-54p" href="#trans-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a><br/>
而烟瘾亦不作矣。又一鲍姓者。先自吸洋烟。后因歇业。戒而不吸。二年余矣。病痢困惫甚剧。无力医治。日求仙方。一日求得百部一两。众谓此物能杀虱。岂可服一两之多。即服宜减之。病者坚信不摇。<a id="orig-55p" href="#trans-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a><br/>

总之吸烟之人。肠中积宿。愈久愈坚。岂可再用止涩耶。　　或曰吸烟之体多虚。若再下之。难保不暴脱也。余曰。医家病家之所误者。只在此句。盖积滞在内。脾不能为胃行其津液。胃有陈积未去。势必不能纳新。<a id="orig-59p" href="#trans-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a><br/>

余治是症。用是药。无不应手而愈。方则每多相同。其食切忌温燥。以致胃液干枯。不能敷布于上。而为腹硬咳嗽变成疳劳之症。如芳香则宜藿香、菖蒲、佩兰叶、佛手柑等。清暑则宜鲜荷叶。鲜青蒿、六一散、黑山栀、条芩、川连等。苦味坚肠。且以止痢也。运气则宜广皮、木香、槟榔、腹皮等。<a id="orig-63p" href="#trans-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a><br/>
消食则宜神曲、谷芽、麦芽、山楂、午时茶、五谷虫、鸡内金之类。健脾则宜西洋参、茯苓、炒麦冬、炒扁豆、甘草、粳米之类。养胃阴则宜石斛、麦冬、木瓜、乌梅之类。利小便则宜车前子、泽泻、滑石之类。杀虫则宜胡黄连、榧子、使君子、槟榔之类。然必佐以甘药以诱之。使虫喜甘而求食也。儿医之治泻痢。每用葛根。观叶氏书。当知所忌。以上诸药。平淡无奇。善用之变化无穷。<a id="orig-64p" href="#trans-64p" class="marker">[64p]</a><br/>

入肺为涕。痰与涕。同为津液之化。而津液又生于胃。为水谷所归。炼气存精。为之津液。上升肺而下输脾。则又随气营运。痰因气而周历四肢巅顶。无所不到。故内伤外感。皆能生痰。治外感寒则温之。<a id="orig-69p" href="#trans-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a><br/>
火则清之。治内伤虚则补之。实则泻之。壅上宜吐。滞下宜攻。此大略也。如痰因风生。则用轻剂疏其表。风为阳邪。从皮毛而入腠理。渐渐达于肺胃。必致水谷之精液。不能上升。因郁结而化痰。<a id="orig-70p" href="#trans-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a><br/>
仍当从肺窍咳出。肺位最高。故宜轻剂。风淫于内。治以辛凉，佐以苦甘。吴氏之银翘散、桑菊饮、是也。如风已化热。热蒸胃液而成痰。宜佐以清胃之品。知母、花粉、石膏、竹叶、等是也。如感寒邪而生痰。则毛窍闭拒。肺气逆满。太阳之气。<a id="orig-71p" href="#trans-71p" class="marker">[71p]</a><br/>
　　无以发泄于外。宜杏苏散、麻杏甘石汤之类。热盛则佐以条芩、知母、桑皮、山栀等。如暑邪由口鼻吸受。直趋中道。　　入于胃府。积滞而为热痰。宜白虎汤、竹叶石膏汤之类。宣泄热邪。如湿郁于中。脾胃不克升降。壅阻为痰。务须运脾清胃。运脾宜浓朴、干姜、腹皮、山楂、茯苓、苍术、藿香、豆蔻、橘皮之类。<a id="orig-72p" href="#trans-72p" class="marker">[72p]</a><br/>
清胃宜竹茹、条芩、知母、甘草、花粉之类。或加淡渗利水之味。如湿郁变成热症。又宜透湿清热。如芩、连、知、柏、豆卷、通草、滑石之类。详见吴氏条辨。薛氏湿热病篇。如伤秋金燥气。消烁肺胃之津液而化痰。宜滋养肺胃之阴。喻氏主清燥救肺汤。或佐以五汁。养阴甘凉润燥。即雪羹之类亦是。<a id="orig-73p" href="#trans-73p" class="marker">[73p]</a><br/>
且六淫之中。火最生痰。火有君相之别。五志之分。治肝火以苦泄。治胃火以苦降。苦泄与苦降不同。　　苦泄如山栀、青黛、龙胆、芦荟、猪胆等。苦降如大黄、黄连、黄芩、知母、黄柏、枳实等。又痰郁久而化火。其升于上则怔忡眩晕。嘈杂不寐。入于经络。则疼痛瘫痪麻木结核。<a id="orig-74p" href="#trans-74p" class="marker">[74p]</a><br/>
入于肌腠。则凝滞而成痈疽。流于下焦。则必痿痹鹤膝骨疽。　　入于胞络。则又痰厥癫痫痴呆昏迷。大抵怔忡眩晕。嘈杂不寐。宜清火以治肝。佐以安神之药。如羚羊角、桑叶、丹皮、山栀、钩藤、天竺黄、连翘、麦冬、茯神、远志、青黛、牡蛎、石决明之属。疼痛瘫痪麻木、则宜控涎丹、滚痰丸、及荆沥、竹沥之属。盖痰居深远。不克吐出。<a id="orig-75p" href="#trans-75p" class="marker">[75p]</a><br/>
不得不从下也。凝结肌腠而成痈疽。宜调和营卫。佐以芳香透络。开腠如归、芍、穿山甲、白芥子、桃仁、乳香、没药、皂角之属。攻其瘀积而导散之。痿、痹、鹤膝、骨疽。则宜大活络、控涎丹之属。　　诚以下焦之痰。非峻药不能通达也。痰、厥、癫、痫、痴、呆、昏迷。又宜运出胞络之痰。先用藜芦汤吐之。至症急口噤。<a id="orig-76p" href="#trans-76p" class="marker">[76p]</a><br/>
用藜芦为末。　　搐入鼻内。亦能致吐。若过吐不止。用葱汤饮之即解。次用牛黄清心丸、或白金丸、以清余邪。又次用安魂定神丸。　　以善其后。无不效验如神。以上皆六淫外邪之治法也。至有因内伤者。形寒饮冷则伤肺。肺被伤则寒邪郁结于内。而下得出。<a id="orig-77p" href="#trans-77p" class="marker">[77p]</a><br/>
势必喘逆咳嗽。喉中作水鸡声。即金匮支饮、悬饮、是也。轻则苏子降气汤。重则小青龙汤。射干麻黄汤。以寒邪非温散不可耳。如饮食不调。失饥伤饱。劳倦伤脾。脾阳不升。宜补中益气汤。小建中汤。调其中而痰自化。<a id="orig-78p" href="#trans-78p" class="marker">[78p]</a><br/>
如暴怒伤肝。肝气逆而犯胃。亦能生痰。又必胁痛呕吐。口苦嗳酸。宜逍遥散加丹皮、山栀、青黛、竹茹。或越鞠丸用青黛为衣。或加石斛、木瓜、乌梅、川连、辈以平胃气。或用代赭、海石、蒺藜、辈以镇肝。使土木无忤则安矣。　　如因房劳伤肾。水泛为痰。亦必喘逆倚息不能卧。然与寒邪伤肺之喘逆有间。<a id="orig-79p" href="#trans-79p" class="marker">[79p]</a><br/>
气邪伤肺。其脉必弦。或沉细而寸口滑数。　　肾虚之喘逆。其脉必虚大。尺脉反浮。可按验也。水泛为痰。宜治温补。轻则建中汤。重则二加龙牡汤。或八味肾气丸作煎剂。使肾中温暖。水不上泛。<a id="orig-80p" href="#trans-80p" class="marker">[80p]</a><br/>
而痰喘自除矣。经云。精不足者。补之以味。故必用杞子、当归、鹿角胶、潼蒺藜、海螵蛸、杜仲、补骨脂、雄骏之物。乃克有济。年久老痰。窠囊锢结。当遵喻氏法以运出之。又须继以补脾。而为填空之计。胸腹堆酿成痰癖。坚大如盂如盘。当用丸药攻之。<a id="orig-81p" href="#trans-81p" class="marker">[81p]</a><br/>
如大黄、三棱、莪术、归须、桃仁、巴豆、莱菔子等为丸。然终不可过服。以伤正气。予因治痰古无成法。妄为评论。尚希高明裁正。　　卷上诸论　　治喉症宜分三大纲论　　咽喉诸症。古人分七十二名目。其实三大纲统之矣。三大纲者何。一曰喉蛾。二曰喉痹。三曰喉风。喉蛾者。<a id="orig-82p" href="#trans-82p" class="marker">[82p]</a><br/>
初起恶寒发热。形圆高肿。色赤脉数或紧。四五日即脓成，治法于未溃时。宜刺少。商、少冲、中冲、出血。药宜解毒消肿。　　方剂如银花、赤芍、丹皮、黄连、黄芩、皂角、生甘草、贝母、枳壳之类。吹药如稀涎散。开关散之类。或用桐油探吐其痰。关窍一通。即能消肿进食。如四五日后。<a id="orig-83p" href="#trans-83p" class="marker">[83p]</a><br/>
脓已成。其色或赤或紫。脉洪大而数。须刺破患处。泄其脓毒恶血。内服解毒清火。如银花、连翘、丹皮、山栀、黄连、黄芩、生甘草、贝母、归地之类。外吹排脓化毒之药。如黄连、黄芩、朴硝、冰片、硼砂。少加轻粉、牛黄。即冰硼散随症加味可也。如溃久不愈。则名烂喉蛾。有虚实二种。<a id="orig-84p" href="#trans-84p" class="marker">[84p]</a><br/>
虚者色白腐。脉虚数。实者色紫而脉沉紧。虚者宜人参养荣汤、生脉散之类。实者宜鲜菊叶、紫花地丁草之类。火毒盛者。仍用芩、黄、丹皮等清之。甚者加犀角、大黄。喉痹乃君相二火相并所发。形如小棋。初起无发热恶寒之表症。十余日方成脓。内经云。一阴一阳结而为喉痹。<a id="orig-85p" href="#trans-85p" class="marker">[85p]</a><br/>
一阴者。手少阴君火之脉气也。一阳者。手少阳三焦之脉气也。二脉共络于喉。气盛则内结而肿胀。胀甚则气痹痹者闭也。故治喉痹。当以散结泻火为主。初起亦宜刺少商等穴出血。治与喉蛾大同小异。方中宜加桔梗、僵蚕、玉枢丹等散结之品。吹药如吕雪、品雪、锡类散等类。惟喉风形症。<a id="orig-86p" href="#trans-86p" class="marker">[86p]</a><br/>
与前不同。治亦迥异。其症初起漫肿不高。或外连颈肿。必发热恶寒。而脉浮数。痰涎壅塞。初起宜普济消毒饮、张氏六味汤、随症加减。吹药宜疏凡化痰顺气。如皂角、薄荷、僵蚕、人中白、黄芩、黄连、硼砂、冰片之类。溃烂色紫。必加珍珠、西牛黄、琥珀之类。　　以生肌败毒。如虚烂日久。<a id="orig-87p" href="#trans-87p" class="marker">[87p]</a><br/>
色白脉虚。方药宜用温补。吹药亦勿过寒。如芩、连、西牛黄、冰片之类。咸在所忌。宜用琥珀、珍珠、滴乳石、人中白、朱砂之类。生肌和血。又有弄舌喉风。哑喉风。乃毒盛于内。必重用解毒。缠喉风乃风毒上盛。主以辛凉轻散。锁喉风真者。<a id="orig-88p" href="#trans-88p" class="marker">[88p]</a><br/>
乃绝症不治。面青瞠目。轻者以桂附八味加玉枢丹一锭。磨冲。此须开其上而温其下也。　　喉症之书甚多。大略不越于此。更能深思类推。则游刃有余矣。近有时疫白喉一书。论症以足三阴为主。盖喉症皆在手经。不关足经。古书具在。<a id="orig-89p" href="#trans-89p" class="marker">[89p]</a><br/>
何得经脉倒置。真是无知妄作。明者自知。姑勿深辨耳。　　卷上诸论　　喉症吹药论　　喉症以吹药为外治之要。不可不深究也。盖外科每每不知药性。修合几种通治之药。若遇重症。非但不效。必至误事。况喉症吹药。尤当随症制配。各味预研极细粉霜。<a id="orig-90p" href="#trans-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a><br/>
庶药与症对。奏功乃捷速耳。初起肿痛。牙关不开。痰涎上壅。宜用玉枢丹。茶汁磨以漱口。或用牙皂开关。或用桐油以鹅翎蘸之卷入喉中。涌去其痰。即关窍通而能饮食矣。如牙关紧急。挖之不开。可用牙皂为末。<a id="orig-91p" href="#trans-91p" class="marker">[91p]</a><br/>
吹入鼻内。则口即开。或以藜芦末吹入鼻孔。亦能吐痰开关。或用生半夏擦两颊车皆效。如脓成肿胀。于患处点破。去其脓毒、恶血。如畏刀针。以人指甲、壁钱、瓦上焙枯为末。加冰片少许吹入患处。亦能穿破。名代刀散。如肿痛痰壅。<a id="orig-92p" href="#trans-92p" class="marker">[92p]</a><br/>
玉枢丹、土牛膝根、万年青根、捣汁入醋二三滴滴口最妙。硼砂、朴硝、胆矾、牛胆、硝矾。皆能消肿化毒去腐。赤肿火盛。则黄连、黄芩。青鱼胆、青黛、西瓜霜。皆能清火解毒。风火上壅。宜薄荷、僵蚕、冰片、青黛等凉散之品。毒盛者。宜西牛黄、雄精、人中白、为解毒之良药。溃烂新肉不生。宜用珍珠、西黄、朱砂、琥珀之类以生肌。然必腐尽乃可用之。<a id="orig-93p" href="#trans-93p" class="marker">[93p]</a><br/>
若腐肉不去。即用生肌等药。反致毒邪内伏。不能收功。　　宜知之也。喉症应用之药品无多。知其性以随症配合。自然灵妙异常。起危症于须臾耳。　　卷上诸论　　推摩法论　　推摩法。乃先师之真传秘法。按病推之。有立竿见影之效。因后世不得传授手法。<a id="orig-94p" href="#trans-94p" class="marker">[94p]</a><br/>
以致弃置不用。几于失传。盖小儿脏腑柔脆。受风寒暑湿之邪。即便发热。或受惊吓。肝胆气浮。热发于内。血热沸腾。医者不能见病知源。发表清里。用药杂乱。则以小儿柔脆之脏腑。运化乳食。<a id="orig-95p" href="#trans-95p" class="marker">[95p]</a><br/>

在膈上者宜吐。在肠胃者宜下。在脏则非汤剂所能尽主之知矣。如肺病多有用散者。以肺居最高用药宜轻。心肝脾有或宜丹或宜丸者。以其地位深幽。治之宜缓。肾则多虚少实。故或宜于丸。或宜于膏。内经云。　　肾藏精。精不足者。<a id="orig-100p" href="#trans-100p" class="marker">[100p]</a><br/>
补之以味。故肾虚者。宜气浊味浓之品。或血肉有情之物。为膏为丸。同类相感。乃克有济。如病在经络。或疼痛流注。或拘挛弛纵。必用微针以调其外。更佐药酒以和其内。则经络和而隧道通。而疾愈矣。<a id="orig-101p" href="#trans-101p" class="marker">[101p]</a><br/>

良有以也。且归神炼气。乃道家工夫。释教以明心见性为上。坐禅虽是见性要着。其中却有妙谛。六祖坛经云。生来坐不卧。死去卧不坐。其了彻生死处。并不在坐与不坐。　　此又在长老自参。不可以明言者耳。至于禅堂坐香。<a id="orig-324p" href="#trans-324p" class="marker">[324p]</a><br/>
如坐一炷香即跪一炷香。始则缓步。后则紧步。使周身之气血上下流通。不至凝滞。过二鼓即就寝矣。诚以子时不睡。则血不归经。必致吐血衄血等症。昔志公和尚日夜讲经。邓天王悯其劳。为制补心丹以赐之。要知人身一小天地。呼吸之气。<a id="orig-325p" href="#trans-325p" class="marker">[325p]</a><br/>
与之相通。不善用之。未有不立蹶者。譬谷麦为养生之本。既饱而强食之。徒伤其生。财物为立命之原。既得而妄取之。徒害夫义。非谓坐禅无所俾益。第过于作劳。必入魔道。而此心反不能自主矣。大梅禅师云。<a id="orig-326p" href="#trans-326p" class="marker">[326p]</a><br/>
即心即佛。是参禅要旨。认定宗旨。下手庶不致为傍门别壳所惑。盖心知色相。盒饭思知色相者是谁。心知烦恼。盒饭思知烦恼者是谁。思无所思。是为真思。行住坐卧。刻刻如此用力。将一旦豁然贯通。诚有不知其所以然而然者。<a id="orig-327p" href="#trans-327p" class="marker">[327p]</a><br/>
古偈云。铁马撞开青石门。玉鸡啄破黄金壳。这个消息。长老掩关静悟。必能自得。总之自性自度。为禅门日用功夫。暗来明可度。邪来正可度。恶来善可度。智能度痴愚。布施度悭贪。清静度烦恼。<a id="orig-328p" href="#trans-328p" class="marker">[328p]</a><br/>
名曰六度。波罗密即到佛法世界。今长老为人所惑。枯坐不寐。则阴阳之枢纽不能交互。而阳浮于外。阴不内守。其有不病者几何。为立潜阳。固阴方法。用二地、二冬、石斛、京元参、杏仁、芩、胶、菀、龟版、牡蛎。煎好加入人乳半钟。守服二十剂。不必更方。<a id="orig-329p" href="#trans-329p" class="marker">[329p]</a><br/>

Narrative:<br/>
<br/>
During the Tang Dynasty, there was a scroll of remedies for illnesses from the Western Regions. A Taoist immortal obtained it and transmitted it to the *Yìwén Zhì* (Records of Arts and Literature).  A song called “Little Pome Island Ballad” said, “After refining gold pills to the extent of a grain, they were unbearable to share with the public.” When a traveler to the Western Regions brought it, he explained that this was it. Indeed, the Taoists’ dragons, tigers, lead, and mercury were merely empty talk. The Jin柏真人 (Jīn Bǎi Zhēn Ren – Jin Bai Zhen Ren, the Jin Bao真人) with his great elixir, ordered Zhang Lao to go out and sell it.<br/>

He drew upon materials found scattered about. He particularly displayed ingenuity and creativity, unconstrained by rigid rules. The monk had broken three ribs on this path.

A Discussion and Correction of the Misinterpretation of Doctor Xu Hui Regarding the Absence of Fault in Treating Patients;<br/>

Even with a hundred victories, unwavering loyalty cannot guarantee success; like the fates of Zhang, Han, Liu, Yue, and other great generals of the Song Dynasty, it ends in failure and lamentation.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a></div>

Chapter One: Concerning the Discussion of Smoke-Dysentery.<br/>
<br/>
Smoke-dysentery is one of the symptoms. Formerly known as stagnation of the bowels. It arises from the accumulation and stagnation within the intestines, and then manifests. This ‘smoke-dysentery’ is merely a false name coined by later generations. The ancients have discussed this in detail. Now, the common name is ‘smoke-dysentery,’ and the methods for treating it are applied. If it is not opened, it becomes constricted; and this is also what the ancient texts state. Recently, smoke has entered China, and those who have become ill with dysentery are called ‘smoke-dysentery.’<a id="trans-52p" href="#orig-52p" class="marker">[52p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">The sick and injured first become timid. It is absolutely necessary to seek drastic remedies quickly. The physician does not understand this principle. He habitually employs gentle remedies to relieve congestion, thereby damaging the condition. Therefore, he was compelled to explain the matter. It is a great absurdity that a person who smokes habitually has a multitude of dry obstructions. If he changes his clothes only five or six days a week, it is ten or more days before he changes them at all. And the food he consumes is not necessarily the same as that consumed by those who do not smoke. Thus, the accumulation within his intestines, over a long period, is far beyond what can be cured.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></div>

Because the accumulation of phlegm prevents the spleen from properly transporting the fluids of the stomach, and the stomach has stagnant phlegm that cannot be cleared, it inevitably cannot receive new fluids.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a></div>

For summer heat, fresh lotus leaves, fresh wormwood, Li Si San (六一散), black栀 (黑山栀), qin (条芩), and chuan lian (川连) are appropriate. Bitter flavors strengthen the bowels, and also serve to stop diarrhea.

A Discussion on the Effectiveness of Radish Greens in Treating Diarrhea<br/>

Diarrhea is most prevalent in the summer and autumn, often resulting from the accumulation of heat and filth in the diet. Radish greens are the most suitable treatment. It should be done on the winter solstice. The roots and leaves should be placed on the roof, exposed to the wind, rain, frost, and snow. Harvested at Qingming Festival.

It is wished that physicians should widely recount their cases, for this is also a source of benefit. The entire *Nei Jing* contains no word for “phlegm.” Master Jinwei also classified cough and phlegm as belonging to the same category. This led to later generations treating phlegm solely by focusing on the lungs, unaware that ancient people considered the kidneys to be the root of phlegm production, and the stomach to be the vessel for storing it.<a id="trans-68p" href="#orig-68p" class="marker">[68p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Entering the lung produces phlegm. Phlegm and mucus are together, both transformations of fluid. This fluid originates in the stomach, and is returned to water and grain. Refining air and preserving essence creates this fluid, which then rises to the lung and descends to nourish the spleen. Consequently, it travels with the vital energy and fluids. Phlegm arises from air and permeates throughout the four limbs and the top of the head, reaching everywhere. Therefore, internal injury and external invasion can both generate phlegm. Treat external invasion and cold with warmth.<a id="trans-69p" href="#orig-69p" class="marker">[69p]</a></div>

When stagnation is present, attack it. This is a general outline. For example, phlegm arises from the influence of wind; then use a light dosage to clear it from the surface. Wind is a pathogenic factor that enters the channels from the skin and hair, gradually reaching the lungs and stomach, inevitably causing the essence of water and grain to descend and cannot ascend, resulting in the formation of phlegm.<a id="trans-70p" href="#orig-70p" class="marker">[70p]</a></div>

Treatment was applied when the lesion was just beginning to discharge pus. Small incisions were recommended. The remedies consisted of Shang, Shao Chong, Zhong Chong, and bloodletting. Drugs suitable for detoxification and edema included silver flowers, red peony, cinnabar bark, yellow gentian, yellow chrysanthemum, soapwood, licorice root, mu danxia, and tortoise shell. Medications were administered by inhalation.  A mixture known as “Sparse Saliva Dispersion” and “Gate Opening Powder” were also used. Occasionally, tung oil was employed to expel phlegm, and the orifices were opened to facilitate drainage.

Initially, it is advisable to prick the Shao Shang and other acupuncture points to induce bleeding. The treatment is similar to treating throat edema. The prescription should include items such as Chrysanthemum, Silkworm Cocoons, and Jade Pivot Powder to disperse knots. Medications such as Lu Xue, Pin Xue, and Tin Powder dispersals should be used.

The use of medications for throat disorders is the essential external treatment; it should not be disregarded. It is based on the fact that surgeons often do not understand the properties of medicines. They combine several common remedies for general treatment. If, when encountering serious cases, they do not diligently attempt to adapt their treatments, they will inevitably make mistakes. Especially with throat disorders and the use of medications, it is crucial to tailor the prescriptions to the specific symptoms and meticulously prepare fine powders.<a id="trans-90p" href="#orig-90p" class="marker">[90p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Excessive consumption of pungent foods leads to stiff muscles and withered claws. Excessive consumption of sour foods causes flesh to soften and the lips to crack. Excessive consumption of sweet foods causes bone pain and hair loss. This is the effect of these five flavors. However, grain is what sustains all living beings and embodies the nature of all things, maintaining balance and harmony. Therefore, people continue to eat their accustomed diet even into old age. The ancient method of treating illness involved restoring health with grain-based remedies. No one attempted to excessively strengthen the body after illness, as exemplified by Zhang Zhongjing, the originator of the Six-Pillars Classic.

His pulse was cold, his tongue white and without thirst, his eyes straight with a dullness of spirit. This was due to the internal invasion of heat and the external influence of cold, coupled with a deficiency in the fundamental essence. If, however, fragrant substances were abruptly used to open and invigorate, it would inevitably lead to the violent expulsion of vital energy. Then, ginseng, atractylodes, white peony,藿香 (huāoxiāng –藿香), and winter savory were employed. Nine measures of Japanese sulfur, wood apricot, and others were also used, initially to strengthen the spleen and consolidate the essence, followed by purging and resolving the fever.<a id="trans-194p" href="#orig-194p" class="marker">[194p]</a></div>

Using a prescription of four substances, with safflower, radix notoginseng, radix dioscoreae sanguinea, radix polygala, radix borneol, honeybee wax, honeysuckle, chrysanthemum, and dendrobium, it was cured in several courses. These two conditions are a matter of both deficiency and excess.<br/>

Fox Hernia: Clinical Experience<br/>
Within the inner office of the Shiyi Medical Bureau on Hanguan’s Back Street, a young man named Chang was treated. He suffered from fox hernia, with a localized pain. The testicles dropped downwards when he was upright, and ascended into the lower abdomen when he lay down. The scrotum was red and swollen and painful. I examined him. The pulse was large and tense on the left, and deficient and moist on the right. I said, “It is due to the stagnation of damp heat in the Yang Ming.”<a id="trans-293p" href="#orig-293p" class="marker">[293p]</a></div>

Indeed, Yangming and 厥阴 both govern the zongjin (vital organs). Their pulses follow the yin channels. When pressed against the area of the xiafu (hypochondrium), it is treated by first using methods to dispel dampness and loosen the air. Then, following the method of Chen Xiu Yuan, a prescription was used containing two Chen Tangs, wood fragrance, Sichuan pepper, magnolia seeds, carpus seeds, and small fennel. After taking three courses of treatment, the patient became somewhat relieved. Subsequently, the Chen and Ren meridians were stimulated, and the condition was cured.<br/>

In the winter of the fifth year of the Wei Dynasty, he suffered from urinary obstruction for half a year or more, and it gradually healed. The urine was difficult to excrete in drops.

He was forced to go to the Western medicine practitioner and used a suction tube to extract it, several times a day, which he considered his normal condition. He delayed seeking the advice of the physician for a long time.

She immediately summoned Zhao Zhao Yu to treat her. After taking two doses of medicine, she was invariably cured. Suddenly, one evening she developed a severe fever and labored breathing.<br/>

Zhao Zhao Yu then examined her. The two cun (measure of distance) and three chi (measure of distance) pulses were both greatly elevated and numerous. The two chi pulses were extremely deficient.<a id="trans-347p" href="#orig-347p" class="marker">[347p]</a></div>

The following day, he was re-examined. The pulse and vital energy were immediately restrained, and there was also a root sensation in the two脇 (two脇 –脇 refers to the side, flank) areas which caused pain. Therefore, I changed to a lighter prescription for nourishing blood, opening the liver, and regulating the channels.

A hermit named Qian Shicheng was at the temple of Ningbo. He set up an inkstone under the southern end of the east corridor. A scholar named Xu Junrui was under the east corridor. He claimed to have thoroughly read the *Ma Yi* (a collection of ancient texts). On that day, I saw Qian’s face yellow and withered, with a sickly green vapor like smoke.

I merely observe the color present at this time. The *Nei Jing* says, ‘Yellow is like the hardness of the bark of the wild jujube tree; it leads to death. The hair withers and the color becomes sickly, dying in autumn.’ This indicates a deficiency of the vital energy of the intestines and stomach. This person will certainly die from a fever of diarrhea and dysentery during the autumn season. It was caused by the great fire in the west in July and August, which melted stone and produced gold; this caused the lung energy to become even more deficient.’”<a id="trans-384p" href="#orig-384p" class="marker">[384p]</a></div>

The consequences should be as I have said. Whenever one judges a person’s life or death by observing their appearance, one must examine their vital energy. For color is a sign, and vital energy is the root. If color is withered but still possesses vital energy, it indicates the illness is not yet severe enough to cause death.<br/>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Let me not study the *Inner Canon*. Volume Two, Medical Cases. Cases of True Organs Diagnosed Pre-Mortally. Year of the Rooster. I was in Ning. A man from Wenzhou, Mr. Bian, was examined. Approximately forty years of age. I cut his pulse, the superficial part being greatly deficient and expansive, like lard on the surface of a dish. After prolonged pressing, it resembled the movement of fish leaping and swimming. I asked him if he had previously bled. He said no. Then, did his chest and throat ache? He said no. I asked him what his true suffering was. He said that recently his limbs had felt somewhat heavy and swollen.<a id="trans-386p" href="#orig-386p" class="marker">[386p]</a></div>

My limbs are heavy with dampness, but it is merely a minor ailment, and yet my appetite remains good. What illness could there be? You should appreciate my wisdom. I will not prescribe a remedy.

The next day, the sun was high but he did not rise. His companions calling him did not elicit a response. He used his hand to push him, and he had already stiffened. It is recorded that a sickness of the pulse is different from illness, and is called “wandering corpse.” A person who has no serious illness will not show the true pulse of the organs. This is because the vital energy of the internal organs has been depleted for a long time, and it is most important to pay close attention to it.<br/>

Therefore, I instructed the man of enlightened intent to use gentle words to urge him to rest. After recovery, he could return. The female servant spoke as she went home. The physician treated him until autumn, when he seemed somewhat settled, but then returned. The man of enlightened intent again invited me to examine his pulse, which was as it had been at first. I said that the pulse still had no roots; one must guard against excessive heat and cold. Consequently, he died in the early winter.<br/>

The initial concept of ‘Heart Meditation’ was like a substance covering the moon; I dared not reveal it to the world.
