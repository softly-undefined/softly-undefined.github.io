Concerning Evil Doors<br/>
<br/>
*   *Qian Jin Fang* [Tang, Sun Simiao]<br/>
<br/>
*   Flying Corpse Ghosts and Evil Spirits<br/>
<br/>
Those afflicted with *shi-chuan* and evil spirits are, in essence, among the five corpses, and are also those afflicted by various ghosts and evil spirits. Their manifestations comprise thirty-six to ninety-nine different types. They cause a general feeling of cold, heat, and dampness, induce stillness and silence, leaving the sufferer unaware of their suffering and unable to find relief anywhere, accumulating over years and months, eventually leading to stagnation and ultimately death. After death, they continue to influence the spirits of others, and eventually lead to the destruction of the family lineage. Those experiencing such symptoms should seek immediate treatment.<br/>
<br/>
All cases of severe abdominal pain, when treated with numerous hot medicinal preparations entering the abdomen, remain still and silent, but benefit those with a rapid breath; this is the *shi-chuan* illness, and should be treated first by administering one liter of licorice juice, and when the symptoms subside, by taking a full dose of瞿-Mai (a medicinal decoction), which will cause a bowel movement, alleviate the hardened symptoms, and resolve the hardened remains of food, and the pain and irregular menstruation experienced by women.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a> Ghosts Strike<br/>
<br/>
The illness of Ghosts Striking manifests as a sudden onset, progressing without gradual development, ultimately attacking the human body like a stabbing, causing severe, agonizing pain in the chest, flanks, and abdomen that cannot be suppressed by pressing, sometimes resulting in vomiting blood, or bleeding from the nose and mouth, or bleeding internally. It is known as Ghosts Striking.<br/>
<br/>
Sudden Discord<br/>
<br/>
Sudden Discord is immediately equivalent to being struck by evil spirits. It is similar to Ghosts Striking and Sudden Death, and both are treated by drawing out and utilizing the excess.<br/>
<br/>
Medical Compendium of Essentials [Lou Ying, Ming Dynasty]<br/>
<br/>
Being Struck by Evil<br/>
<br/>
The patient experiences a sudden swelling and distention of the abdomen, with ineffective vomiting, resembling a severe, dry fever. This is what is commonly referred to as being struck by evil. It arises from a deficient spirit and a mind filled with fear, leading to an attack by evil spirits, which may attach themselves, causing a silent, vacant state, uttering delusional words, insulting and cursing, revealing secrets, disregarding criticism, speaking of fortune and misfortune, and ultimately, at the time of its occurrence, the hair remains intact, while others observe a person’s sudden change of mind, knowing the cause, climbing to dangerous heights, behaving as if walking on level ground, or weeping and groaning, unwilling to see others, exhibiting a state of intoxication or madness, with a multitude of symptoms, but treated with remedies and practices commonly employed.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a> Five Corpses<br/>
<br/>
The Flying Corpse: It begins with no discernible origin, gradually developing until it reaches a state of complete stillness. Its appearance is characterized by pain in the abdomen, labored breathing, and distension. The Stopped Corpse: It halts in the muscles and blood vessels of the human body; upon contact, it immediately develops, causing pain in the abdomen, labored breathing, and distension, attacking the flank and heart. After recovery, it relapses. The Submerged Corpse: When it manifests, it causes pain in the abdomen, distension, and labored breathing. Even after rest, a heavy, corrupt influence remains within the organs of the human body, causing discomfort everywhere. The Wind-Swept Corpse: It moves within the limbs, circulating the meridians; its appearance is cold and erratic, moving back and forth, silent and without pain. When struck by wind, it manifests. The Hidden Corpse: Its illness hides within the five internal organs, accumulating over many years without being removed, leaving the body without obvious ailment. When it manifests, it causes pain in the abdomen, distension, and labored breathing. Furthermore, there are those with corpse symptoms that develop, in which case the corpse symptoms within the five internal organs become manifest, accompanied by external evil spirits that flow into the body, causing chills, fever, and dampness, or causing lumps to rise, or limbs to contract and pull at the waist and back, or making the body heavy and difficult to move, with a confused mind, constantly feeling disorientation, with changes in every joint, resulting in great harm. After many years and months, it gradually becomes stagnant, eventually leading to death. After death, it is easily transferred to another person, and even to the extinction of a family line, hence it is called corpse symptoms. All are treated with the use of the poison ivy plant, grinding several斛 into a paste and boiling until thick, taking the juice and drinking it three times a day, when recovering.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a> Ancient and Modern Medical Systems [Ming Xu Chunfu]<br/>
<br/>
An Account of Malign Spirits<br/>
<br/>
《Internal Classic》states: When malefic airs and energies prevail, it manifests as congestion; when righteous energy dominates, it manifests as emptiness. The “malefic” referred to in this classic encompasses wind-cold, summer heat, dampness, and dryness, as well as the unrestrained influence of fire. This is not akin to the “ghosts and demons” commonly perceived by the vulgar. When a patient experiences a hollow heart, anxiety, and a state of vigilance, such as one in a drunken or stupefied state, resembling the attachment of a malignant spirit; or when the yang energy within the body becomes congested, leading to climbing and singing, discarding clothing and running about, these are all manifestations of fire-phlegm, not the delusion of malignant spirits.<br/>
<br/>
Danxi states: What is commonly called “chong evil” refers to the act of forcefully expelling malignant spirits and, in doing so, contracting the illness. Those afflicted with this condition have never been without first experiencing a depletion of their vital energy and blood. Vital energy and blood are the essence of the heart’s spirit. When this spirit weakens, malignant energies enter, and reason may be disturbed. If the blood and vital energy are both deficient, leading to phlegm obstructing the heart and chest, hindering the ascent and descent, and preventing proper circulation, the twelve organs each lose their function, resulting in distorted vision, hearing, speech, movement, all becoming illusory, and attempting to treat this with malignant spirits will inevitably lead to death.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a> Illness originates from the heart.<br/>
<br/>
All secluded places in valleys and hidden retreats harbor spirits and demons, foxes and beasts, and even the chickens and dogs of the human world can become demonic. Even if they bewitch people, they merely resemble those with deficient vital energy and weakened righteous energy. Weakened righteous energy is equivalent to a heart afflicted by evil, and an evil-afflicted heart leads to false visions, false hearing, false speech, and false movement; all of this is simply evil. Only when evil perceives evil, it exists. A virtuous person, without illness, cannot be seen; it is truly remarkable. Only when the heart is completely pure, will all evil spirits avoid it; what cause is there for suspicion of demonic influences?<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a> Forbidden incantations, drug administration, and simultaneous treatment.<br/>
<br/>
In treating evil spirits and ailments, one should dispel suspicion through the cessation of incantations, and drug administration must carefully examine the reality and lightness of phlegm, heat, and cold, and adjust the treatment accordingly, thus achieving a rapid cure. If only relying on witchcraft without using drugs, the illness cannot be removed, and there is no remedy. If only using drugs without witchcraft to dispel suspicion, the cure will be slow. Therefore, simultaneous internal and external treatment is effective, which is the reason for the establishment of the incantations.<br/>
<br/>
Pulse Observation<br/>
<br/>
Sudden looseness and sudden tightness of the pulse, sometimes large and sometimes small, sometimes quick and sometimes slow; all are indicative of evil pulses. A tight, rapid pulse indicates a fleeing corpse, and a slippery pulse indicates a ghost’s attack.<br/>
<br/>
Diagnosis and Treatment with the String Instrument [Ming Wang Ken Tang]<br/>
<br/>
The symptoms of severe evil are caused by offenses against improper air, resulting in sudden reversal of coldness in the limbs, the skin covered with small bumps, a dark complexion on the face, a loss of mental focus, sometimes uttering incorrect words or nonsense, the teeth tight and the mouth sealed, or the head spinning and falling over, unconscious of one’s surroundings. This is the case of sudden collapse, misalignment of organs, fleeing corpses, and ghostly attacks. Those who die are mourned, and inquiries are made about the deceased, often visiting temples and tombs, and many cases are found in this manner. One administers the Accordant Essence Pill and administers it with a liquid, and after a slight recovery, one prescribes the Accordant Air and Stomach Pill for circulation. This is named the Accordant Air and Stomach Pill.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a> Stone Chamber Secret Texts [Chen Shitishi]<br/>
<br/>
A sudden illness requires immediate treatment, and delay is unacceptable. For example, when a person is possessed by evil, it is due to phlegm. The remedy consists of fifteen grains of ginseng, fifteen grains of white atractylos, fifteen grains of prepared radix Bupleurum, and a small amount of soapwood powder; fifteen grains of dried orange peel. These are simmered in eight ounces of water. The efficacy of this prescription lies in the soapwood powder’s ability to open the pores and draw the herbs directly into the meridian channels, completely dispelling the phlegm and its confusion, allowing evil to cease.<br/>
<br/>
Return-to-Life Decoction [Zhongjing, and following] Treats those who die from evil spirits disturbing the vital essence. Two portions of ephedra, each two taels. Seventy taels of apricot kernels, with their skins removed. One hundred and seventy of them. One tael of charred licorice root. The three ingredients are simmered in eight catties of water, reducing the liquid to three catties, straining it, and then administering it to the patient by mouth. This prescription is effective for all cases of illness caused by evil spirits disturbing the vital essence.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a prescription: A bundle of chives, twenty-seven black dates, half a pint of fragrant pepper, all ground together. The three ingredients are simmered in a斛 (a large measure, approximately 20 liters) of water. The liquid is reduced to three catties, strained, and then the patient is instructed to comb their hair while drinking it three times. Those that float are alive; those that sink are dead. The liquid is reduced to three catties, strained, and then consumed.<a id="trans-7p" href="#orig-7p" class="marker">[7p]</a> Five Poison Decoction: [《Qianjin Fang》，continued]<br/>

<br/>
《Danxi Xinfa》 states: For conditions of deficiency and phlegm, there resembles the intrusion of evil spirits.  Blood essence is the spirit of the body; when the spirit is weakened and deficient, evil spirits enter. The principle may already have it. If both blood essence and qi are deficient, phlegm occupies the middle burner, obstructing ascents and descents, preventing proper function, resulting in the dysfunction of all twelve organs, causing blindness, deafness, speechlessness, and movement to become illusory. Treating such a condition with evil spirits inevitably leads to death. A young boy, during a hot month, overworked himself and drank freely of plum juice, also experienced three or four severe shocks, claiming to see and hear illusions. His pulse was weak and hollow, with a heavy sound on both hands. I said: This is due to a deficiency of heat, the heavy sound indicates shock, and the plum juice stagnates at the middle burner.  I replenished the deficiency with clear heat, relieved the stagnation of phlegm, and the illness was cured. I then prescribed ginseng, atractylodes, chuanxiong, pinellia, poria, shaogui, and licorice, boiling them in a concentrated decoction and adding ginger juice from bamboo, for ten days without effect. Everyone blamed my medicine for being ineffective. I examined his pulse, finding that his deficiency had not recovered, and the phlegm had not subsided, so I ordered him to take front-rank (medicine) ginger juice, and after ten days, he recovered.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a> After one man became intoxicated and overfed, he behaved strangely like a spirit; when questioned, he claimed it was due to the spirit of his deceased brother, recounting events from his past life. His uncle then scolded him, saying, “Are you joking?

“*The Treatise on Public Health* states: The deputy minister, Lin, was permitted to travel to Xiongzhou, requesting that I examine his pulse. Upon examination, the pulse was alternately large and small, long and short; this was due to an imbalance of blood and the influence of evil spirits damaging the vital energy. The official explained that he had been staying at the Han郸驿, and had dreamt of a woman wearing blue robes, with no discernible features; upon striking her with his hand beneath his ribs, he experienced persistent pain, accompanied by chills and fever, and was unable to eat. This was a demonic attack. I said, “You should take eight poisonous red pills.” The official had read in *The Records of Famous Physicians* that Li Zi Ye used eight poisonous red pills to exorcise demons and spirits, and he administered three pills. When he lay down, he took them, and the next morning, two jars of water produced an effect.<a id="trans-34p" href="#orig-34p" class="marker">[34p]</a> 《医学纲目》曰：顷在徽城日，尝修和神精丹一料。庚申，余家一妇人，梦中见二苍头，一前一后，手中持一物。前者云：到也未？后应云：到也。击下，爆然有声，遂魇，觉后心一点痛不可忍，昏闷一时许。余忽忆神精丹有此一证，取三粒令服之，少顷已无病矣。云：服药觉痛止神醒，今如常矣。日后相识，稍有邪气，与一二服，无不应验。方在《千金》中，治中风之要药，但近世少得曾青、磁石，为难合尔。<br/>

A corpse stumbling exhibits a pulse that moves but lacks vitality, the vital energy is blocked and not flowing, therefore it remains still and dies.<br/>

**Sudden Death and Collapse**<br/>
<br/>
One who suffers sudden death is completely unresponsive, resembling a dead corpse, but the vital energy does not cease, the pulse remains as before, sometimes the pulse lacks order, sometimes it swells and shrinks, or it is fine and continuous, and if the chest and abdomen are warm, this is the case. Heatstroke and collapse: quickly assist the patient in a cool place, it is absolutely forbidden to use cold water, instead, use cloths and garments dampened with hot soup to iron the navel and the Conception Well, then continue to pour soup over the cloth, allowing it to thoroughly warm the navel and abdomen, and then gradually awaken the patient. If there is no soup immediately available, scoop hot earth onto the navel, and use a large quantity as best, and if it becomes cold, replace it with warm earth. The ancient method used earth to cover the navel, and then to make a depression, allowing the patient to be repeatedly immersed in the center, as a substitute for the soup, and then continue to use bamboo leaves, white tiger plaster, and stone powder soup.<a id="trans-40p" href="#orig-40p" class="marker">[40p]</a> When one suffers from heatstroke, quickly chew a large piece of ginger and swallow it with cold water.

When traveling and suddenly lacking water and feeling severely thirsty, quickly chew two inches of scallion, drink the juice, equivalent to two measures of water. A person in good health, suddenly becoming like a corpse, motionless, unaware of others, eyes closed and unable to open, mouth speechless and unable to speak, or faintly aware of others, dislikes hearing human voices, but experiences dizziness and fever, moving about is when they awaken, this is due to excessive sweating, blood diminishing and air accumulating in the blood, the yang rising but not descending, the air blocked and not flowing, thus the body becomes like a corpse. When the air returns to the blood, yin and yang are restored, therefore moving about is when they awaken, this is called ‘yu mou’ (郁冒) or ‘xue jue’ (血厥). This often occurs in women, and should be treated with White Orchid Powder and Cang Gong Powder.<a id="trans-41p" href="#orig-41p" class="marker">[41p]</a> The Unification of Medicine Ancient and Modern [Ming Xu Chunfu]<br/>
<br/>
Death and Collapse<br/>
<br/>
Bian Que, in *Ju Hou Fang*, considered death and collapse similar, and employed a combination of methods in their treatment. Once dead, fresh ginger root was pounded and its juice poured in, immediately halting the illness. Death, collapse, rising fever, stroke, and heatstroke illnesses, all should be treated by expelling them. Zhong Jing said: When rising fever desires to release it, one must produce a great sweating, therefore the *Fanhun Tang* used Ma Huang (Ephedra), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), to clear the spirit. The *Qinghun Tang* used Jing Jie (Greater Periwinkle) and other remedies to clear the spirit. And all cases of collapse used Soap Root, *Han Xia* (Indian Pentagram Root) to clear the nose, *Liujiu* (Scutellaria) and Arsenic to clear the mouth and remove phlegm, all to open the upper portion and allow external evils to circulate. Heatstroke avoided cold water, fearing it would constrict the meridians, and this was the intention. Mountain dwellers treating those who had suffered from death and collapse would cauterize the navel with hot iron; Soap Root powder was blown into the nostrils; or juice of chives was poured into the ear canals.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a> 《本事方》 says: It is said that those afflicted with illness stemming from imbalances in the vital energy, though not explicitly recorded in the texts, often manifest as symptoms resembling a stroke. Specifically, excessive joy damaging the Yang, excessive anger damaging the Yin, sorrow leading to a loss of direction, and an excess of vital energy resulting in a condition of ‘厥’ (joint inversion), frequently cause this ailment. The symptoms include excessive salivation, tightness of the jaw, and paralysis, and if treated improperly, they lead to death. In the year of Yuan You, the year of the Geng Wu, my mother, Lady Shi, personally experienced this misfortune, and to this day, she regrets it. Lady Shi was naturally weak in vital energy and blood, and due to the loss of her son, she was consumed by grief and worry. Suddenly, she suffered a vital energy collapse, her jaw tightened, and she produced excessive salivation. The local physician immediately administered a stroke remedy, and she died within a single night. Because of this, I still harbor deep regret, and whenever I encounter this type of illness, I immediately administer Su He Xiang Wan (a medicine containing camphor) to revive her, and then adjust her treatment according to her fluctuating cold and heat, with no case remaining untreatable.<br/>
<br/>
Vital illnesses arise when the vital energy does not return to its proper channel, resulting in ‘气中’ (vital energy in the body), manifesting like a stroke, causing collapse, unconsciousness, a tight jaw, and lacking phlegm. It is crucial not to use wind-dampening medications or treatments that open the channels and loosen the flesh, etc. Initially, one should administer ginger juice decoction to soothe the vital energy; then, use Su He Xiang Wan (a medicine containing camphor) and Seven Air Decoction with Stone Xiang (a medicinal herb) to redirect the vital energy. Subsequently, use Zhi Zhong Tang (a medicinal formula) with wood fragrance to harmonize the vital energy, allowing it to return to its proper course. If this fails, the vital energy becomes inverted and manifests as a different syndrome.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a> Diagnosis of Sudden Collapse with Fever<br/>
<br/>
It is recorded that sudden deaths from severe illnesses are all attributed to fire. It is noted that fire possesses a rapid and swift nature. However, in initial treatment, the medicine is neither cold nor descending, nor is it rising. This is particularly true for severe cases. Commonly, distinctions are made between sudden strokes, disrupted vital energy, food-related issues, chills, heatstroke, dampness, and evil influences. When a person suddenly collapses, loses consciousness, or exhibits symptoms such as thick phlegm and congestion in the throat, a distorted mouth and eyes, paralysis of the limbs, inability to move one side of the body, sunken and elevated pulse, or swollen fingers, these can all be treated with sesame oil, ginger juice, and bamboo sap. For instances of speechless lips, the mouth is opened and irrigated, or three portions of “San Ren Drink” (three portions of San Ren Drink) are prepared with two portions of ginseng, simmered and then poured into two or three cups of ginger juice.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a> If the pulse does not open, medicine should not be administered; hasten to grind half-summer grass into powder, inhale it into the nostrils, or combine it with powdered ginger, tallow, and chuanxiong, and if sneezing occurs, the patient will awaken. This can be used to ascertain the depth of the illness; knowing this, one can determine whether it is curable or not. If, with the mouth open, one scatters the residue of urine, this indicates extreme deficiency and excessive yang, so quickly use a mixture of large grains and astragalus to replenish, and also cauterize the area below the navel.<br/>
<br/>
If the patient suffers from copious phlegm and thick sputum, it is advisable to induce vomiting; urgently prepare a diluted sputum-dissolving mixture: using pig teeth, tallow, and solid, un-eaten pieces, grind four handfuls, removing the black skin; also use two or three *jin* (a unit of weight) of cinnabar powder, grinding them uniformly, with a small dose of five *wen* (a unit of weight) and a large dose of three *zi* (a unit of weight), dissolving them in warm water and administering them orally. Furthermore, the *Bixia San* (碧霞散) – select good green stone powder, sift it, then re-grind it with water, taking two or three *qian* (a unit of weight), mixing them with three or four *dou* (a unit of measure) of fresh peppermint, grinding them uniformly, and administering them mixed with warm wine. When the two medicines do not cause excessive vomiting, but merely allow a small amount of saliva to flow from the corners of the mouth, the patient will awaken.<br/>
<br/>
Formerly, it was said that an open mouth signified the cessation of the spleen, scattering urine signified the cessation of the liver, closing the eyes signified the cessation of the liver, scattering urine signified the cessation of the kidneys, and a snoring sound signified the cessation of the lungs; these were all incurable conditions. However, when these five conditions are not entirely present, quickly administer a mixture of grains, astragalus, and lard, cauterize the area below the navel, and one may still find the patient awakens.<br/>
<br/>
If the patient exhibits a straight, clear vomit of froth, shakes the head and raises the arms, the face is red like makeup, sweat appears like pearls, or the face and head are red and black, with the eyes closed and the mouth open, accompanied by labored breathing and urination, these are all incurable conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Among the patients, some do not awaken, some have already awakened, some are newly ill, and some have been ill for a long time, and some vomit purple-red fluid and die.<a id="trans-45p" href="#orig-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a> “传心方” says: To treat a man or woman whose excessive salivation surges into the heart, resulting in sudden collapse, one must immediately assist them into a warm room, supporting them in a correct seated position, and should apply warm vinegar and charcoal fumes directly to the face, allowing the vinegar vapor to penetrate the nostrils. After a long time, the accumulated salivation will naturally return, while the weak will awaken immediately, and those severely afflicted will also regain consciousness. It is absolutely forbidden to allow any drop of liquid, such as soup or water, to enter the throat. If one does, the excessive salivation will remain attached to the heart passages and cannot be removed, inevitably leading to a state of permanent disability.<br/>
<br/>
When afflicted by wind-borne illness, the six pulses are deeply embedded and dormant, and there are also pulses that follow the flow of vital energy downwards, manifesting as excessive prominence. A floating and sluggish pulse indicates good fortune, a firm and rapid pulse indicates serious illness and misfortune. A floating and sluggish pulse indicates cold, a firm and expansive pulse indicates heat, and if not addressed properly, it will lead to a state of weakness. A floating and agitated pulse indicates dampness, a floating and expansive pulse indicates wind, and a floating and numerous pulse without heat also indicates wind. A small, numerous, floating, and tight pulse, and a slow and sluggish pulse are all manifestations of imbalances within the vital energy. Furthermore, when dealing with wind, one should greet the patient, and when dealing with vital energy, one should attend to the mouth. A large and expansive pulse indicates fire, and a slippery pulse indicates phlegm. Those pulses that are floating and slippery, sinking and slippery, and small and weak, are all manifestations of weakness and phlegm, and one must carefully observe the time of year, the climate, and the patient’s habits of waking and sleeping, and combine these observations with visible symptoms to determine the primary diagnosis and administer appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a> Stone Chamber Secret Texts [Chen Shiduo]<br/>
<br/>
A fatal illness resulted in death, such that the person ceased to be aware of their surroundings, unable to speak, sometimes afflicted by the influence of ghosts and spirits, or invaded by mountain demons, ultimately collapsing and remaining unconscious. This type of illness stemmed from the obstruction of vital energy, akin to the confusion of phlegm within the heart. Such strange illnesses often originated from phlegm and did not require alarm or panic; their treatment focused on eliminating the phlegm, and the illness would naturally recover. However, when evil forces gathered, their energy was inherently deficient. Utilizing herbs to dispel phlegm and incorporate them into remedies for restoring vital energy, the illness would depart as if swept away. The deceased would be reborn. Specifically, one should take white atractylodes (Bai Zhu) five chi (approximately 18.75 grams), ginseng,茯苓 (Fu Ling), danpi (Huang Qin), Tian Nan Xing (Cyperus rotundus) each three chi (approximately 56.25 grams), white pecelia (Bai Jie Zi) one chi (approximately 18.75 grams), fresh Sichuan root (Sheng Fu Zi) five fen (approximately 0.6 grams), fresh ginger a large piece pounded for juice, water mixed with wine in a ratio of one to one, totaling two bowls, simmered for eight portions, and consumed. Externally, soap cashews (Zao Jiao) were ground into a powder and applied. When administering the soap cashew powder, one first used a piece of paper, wetting and sealing it to cover the nostrils of the person receiving the treatment, then ground it into a fine powder. A spoonful was taken with a goose feather tube and blown into the patient’s nostrils, inevitably inducing a sneeze, and then the medicine was poured in, immediately reviving the person, who would vomit phlegm and water, ranging from half to a full basin, of a viscous or liquid consistency, and in colors such as yellow, black, green, or red. The person would naturally feel drowsy and inclined to sleep, and it was not to be alarmed. Allowing them to sleep naturally. Upon waking, one should take ginseng, danpi, white atractylodes, and white atractylodes, each one chi, white atractylodes five chi, fu ling, white pecelia, each three chi,陈皮 (Chan Pi - Citrus grandis), and 甘草 (Gan Cao - Glycyrrhiza glabra) each five fen, and simmered for consumption in one dose, which would completely cure the illness. This was one method of treating this type of death.<a id="trans-47p" href="#orig-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a> To cure sicknesses of the vital energy, one must first address the deficiency of that energy itself. The evil then enters by exploiting this emptiness. Therefore, ginseng is used to strengthen the vital energy, while danxia, baijiezi, and tiannanxing are used to expel evil and phlegm. Tiannanxing is particularly effective at dispelling evil by penetrating the heart. Using the intense heat of puzi, a single incision is made, and the evil is startled and driven out, causing it to immediately expel upwards. However, after the evil has departed, one must replenish the stomach’s vital energy, so no agents to remove phlegm are used, but instead, products to strengthen the spleen and stomach are employed. Furthermore, there is a method of treating death-like symptoms, such as those of paralysis, which is also caused by deficiency of vital energy. One uses ginseng one ounce, baijue, danxia, and fuling each five chi, changpu one chi, and chenpi five fen to treat it. Although these are all instances of sickness of the vital energy, the former are instances of yang evil, while this is an instance of encountering yin evil. Yang evil is encountered during the day, while yin evil is encountered at night. After the symptoms have subsided, one still uses ginseng to replenish the vital energy, but does not use tiannanxing or similar herbs, instead directly entering the heart.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a> If unable to use language, use the residue of soap to apply it. If the first two symptoms persist with urination, and the hands are scattered, there is little that can be saved; otherwise, it is a single prescription to restore life. These two symptoms are methods for treating death. When encountering related symptoms, the head is clearly understood. The approximate method for curing evil lies in these two formulas; then, considering the lightness or severity of the illness, the quantity of medicine used, one obtains it.<br/>
<br/>
A person suddenly sees a ghost and falls; they may be within a temple or beside a coffin, encountering the evil of a corpse, and become unconscious. If this is the case, administer melon rind powder, and they will inevitably cough up phlegm, like a spring, pouring out in torrents; when the ghost retreats, it is sufficient. If the ghost remains visible after coughing, the phlegm is not yet cleansed, and then use the previous melon rind powder to administer it, until the ghost no longer appears. Afterwards, use white atractylodes (one or two portions), pyeongling (five portions), white vitex (one portion), shenqi (one portion), prepared ginger (one portion), and cinnamon (five portions), simmered in water and taken. This method is suitable for the poor.<a id="trans-49p" href="#orig-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a> 方<br/>

<br/>
Large Yellow, Dried Ginger, Sichuan Buttonseed (stripped of their skins, points, hearts, and roots), each one two ounces. The right ingredients must be exceptionally fresh. First, grind the Large Yellow and Dried Ginger into a powder. Grind the Sichuan Buttonseed within its core, then combine and pound with a thousand mortars. Mix with honey to form pellets, storing them in a vessel. This medicine treats sudden deaths from ailments of the heart and abdomen. For those who offend the stomach and cause fullness, pain like a thorn piercing the heart, shortness of breath with constricted mouth, and death before recovery, administer three to four pellets of this medicine mixed with hot, bitter wine, swallowing them with each dose. Do not administer more than this. Hold the head up and pour it down the throat, immediately administer a dose. If it does not work, repeat with three pellets, pressing them into the abdomen and inducing vomiting to bring up the contents, thereby curing the illness. If the mouth is constricted, one must chew and swallow the pellets.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, this formula resolves all heat poisons threatening death, inducing immediate recovery upon ingestion.<br/>
<br/>
Half Summer Poison (Powdered), Vinegar one liter, half cooked and thoroughly dried, four ounces; Red Cinnamon, stripped of its bark, half ounce; White Peony (Psoralea Corylifolia), stripped of its root, half ounce; Sweet Flag (Asarum heterotropum), White Peony (Psoralea Corylifolia), each one ounce. Grind all ingredients into a powder, using ginger juice to form a paste into pellets the size of a litchi fruit. Take fifty pellets with each dose, swallowing them with hot water. I often carried this medicine with me on summer journeys, guarding against sudden illnesses. My servant and I each took one dose daily, with no heat-related illnesses, a remarkable effect, though not always experienced.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a> Attached is a remedy for internal chills, characterized by a stifled mouth, stiff limbs, loss of speech, and inability to speak. Formerly, a warrior stationed at a border outpost, while exposed to a heavy snowfall outside his mountain tent, suddenly collapsed. He was then administered this medicine in two doses, and subsequently recovered.<br/>
<br/>
Large Sichuan Root (Da Fu Zi), pulverized and with the peel and umbilical portion removed; Ginseng; Dried Ginger, pulverized; Licorice Root, scorched; and Bai Zhu (White Job’s Tears), all divided into equal portions.<br/>
<br/>
The remedy is taken as a powder, with each dose consisting of four *qian* (small measures), to be dissolved in a cupful and a half of water. It is to be simmered until reduced to seven parts, then strained, and taken on an empty stomach. If the mouth is stifled, one should administer the liquid by pouring it into the mouth.<br/>
<br/>
This is a single formula.<br/>
<br/>
For those suffering from internal heat and death, it is forbidden to use cold substances, as cold will cause death. One should wrap a piece of *qiu* grass around the patient’s navel, causing three or two to drown within it, warming it. It can also be used with hot mud and *qiu* grass; or by placing a clay pot at the bottom of a cart or wheelbarrow to warm the patient. The goal is to cause drowning. It must be made to flow away. This is what is meant by being stranded on the road and having no remedy; one must make the patient drown. If the remedy is immediately available, it can be administered to the patient. It must not be applied to a clay pot or wheelbarrow, lest this substance be cold. Once the *huo ren* (internal heat) is present in the summer months, it can be obtained from hot mud, used to warm the clay pot, and also used. [Zhong Jing, continued]<a id="trans-54p" href="#orig-54p" class="marker">[54p]</a> To save a dying soldier, pound foetid gourds, extract juice, and administer it into the nostrils.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to save a dying soldier, cut the crest of a male chicken to extract blood, blow into the nostrils, and it will take effect.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to save a dying soldier, melt pig fat the size of a chicken egg, add a pint of bitter wine, boil, and administer it into the throat.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to save a dying soldier, apply chicken liver and blood to the face, and enclose him in a circle of ash, standing him upright.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to save a dying soldier, take two-seven parts of soybeans, mix with chicken egg white and wine, and consume it all.<br/>
<br/>
To save a dying soldier with fever, take half a pound of alum, boil it with two and a half pints of water until dissolved, and immerse his feet up to the ankles.<br/>
<br/>
To save a dying soldier with closed eyes, a rider will pound foetid gourd juice while facing him, blow into his nostrils, and it will take effect.<br/>
<br/>
To save a dying soldier with a gaping mouth and reversed eyelids, cauterize the palms, soles, and claws with fourteen hundred壮 (a unit of measurement for cauterization) and administer to him a decoction of five poisonous pastes containing aconite.<br/>
<br/>
To save a dying soldier with limbs that do not retract and loss of bowel movement, take one pint of horse dung, three pints of water, boil to two pints, and wash with it. Also, take one pint of cow dung, warm wine, and administer it into his mouth; cauterize the heart one inch above, three inches above the navel, and four inches below the navel, each with one hundred壮.<a id="trans-55p" href="#orig-55p" class="marker">[55p]</a> He saved a child who died suddenly and vomited bile, not knowing the cause. He used a pellet of dog dung, extracting juice and administering it. If there was no moisture, he boiled dry herbs and extracted juice from them.<br/>
<br/>
The corpse trembled, its pulse was irregular, and it had no breath; the vital energy was blocked and not flowing. Therefore, it was still and died. He used powdered hemp to blow into the nostrils on either side of the mouth, having a person apply ginger powder to the underside of the tongue.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, one should shave a square inch from the left corner of the hair, burn it, mix it with wine, and administer it orally, while standing upright.<br/>
<br/>
To treat fever and heatstroke: take hot dust and soil and plug it into the upper part of the heart; as it became slightly cooler, the condition improved, and the vital energy flowed freely.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, one should make the person lie on their back, plugging the navel with hot earth, and have them urinate; when warmth returned to the navel, the condition was cured.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, one should drink three *jin* of boiled *tie* (蓼) juice, and it would cure the illness immediately, without lingering.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, one should spread open the mouth of the deceased, allowing it to be filled with warm water, and gently raise the head of the deceased, allowing the water to enter the abdomen; immediately after, the person would revive.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, one should have a person breathe into the heart, warming it, and another person should do so.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, one should hold a dog puppy as one would hold a chicken, pressing it against the heart.<a id="trans-56p" href="#orig-56p" class="marker">[56p]</a> Again, Fang said: Tiles on the south side of the roof cause heat that scorches the heart; cold easily overcomes it. Again, Fang said: Pouring a cup of earth clay juice immediately cures it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, Fang said: A cup of earth yellow juice, taken in small doses.<br/>
<br/>
Again, Fang said: Half a cup of water, mixed with a large amount of dough, taken as a medicine.<br/>
<br/>
朱砂符, cures convulsions and evil airs, causing death.  Writing with cinnabar on the tongue, writing on the forehead, a good remedy.<br/>
<br/>
Convulsions with a fever in the heart: Dry and sun-bake hundred-grass flower, seal and bury in water for one hundred days, cook in a clay pot with continuous water until thick, make into large pills, let the patient chew one pill, it will revive immediately, a great remedy.<br/>
<br/>
Convulsions with evil airs and death, with bleeding from the mouth and nose: Take one money of powdered cinnabar, boil in peach leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Convulsions with evil spirits disturbing sleep and death, with fever: Take one money of musk, grind with two parts vinegar, administer it, and the patient will revive.<br/>
<br/>
Death with limbs paralyzed and stillness: Take half a cup of ginger juice, mix with wine, boil and administer. Also, cauterize the Dan Tian, Baihui, and Qi Hai acupuncture points.<br/>
<br/>
Death with no pulse, no other signs, because the yin and yang have been exhausted.  Take two hundred breaths, taking the breath with the nose, the cow will become ill. If the cow does not obey, apply salt juice to the face, the cow will immediately lick.<a id="trans-57p" href="#orig-57p" class="marker">[57p]</a> Heatstroke causes drowsiness: with fresh water drawn, drip it onto the breasts, and fan the person with a fan. For those severely afflicted, apply earth plaster to the body, and they will recover. If given water to drink, they will die.<br/>
<br/>
The *Ling Shu* Classic states: The Sun root is located in the deepest shadow, manifesting at the Conception Gate. The Conception Gate is the eye. The Sun governs opening, and when this opening is obstructed, the flesh and joints are disrupted, leading to the onset of illness. Therefore, those severely ill should be treated with the Sun, observing the remaining energy and not exceeding it. The flesh and skin are pale and weak.<br/>
<br/>
The *Su Wen* Classic states: Malignant influences reside in the Lesser Yin channels of the hands and feet, specifically the channels of the Yang Ming. These five channels converge at the ear. When all five channels are exhausted, it causes the body’s pulse to move erratically and the body to lose awareness. Its appearance resembles a corpse, sometimes called a “corpse stumbling,” and when pierced, the thumb’s inner side nail edge is stimulated like a leek leaf; then the heart is pierced, followed by the middle toe’s nail edge; then the hand’s inner side nail edge is stimulated like a leek leaf; then the hand’s center is pierced, stimulating the sharp end of the Lesser Yin bone; and finally, the person is made to stand. If this continues, bamboo tubes are blown into both ears, stimulating the front of the left Conception Gate, one inch in diameter, burned, and the person drinks a cup of fragrant water. If the person cannot drink, they are irrigated while standing.<br/>
<br/>
The *Jie Yi* Classic states: A corpse that has become paralyzed and dead does not know people; the pulse is moving as before, the Great Ditan and Da Tun govern it. Confusion and paralysis cause headaches, and the extreme and the *Pu San* govern it.<br/>
<br/>
A corpse that has become paralyzed and dead, the Golden Gate governs it.<a id="trans-58p" href="#orig-58p" class="marker">[58p]</a> 《Shang Han Lun》says: The Shao Yin pulse does not reach, the kidney qi is slight, the essence and blood rush, the breath is hurried and pressing, ascending into the chest and diaphragm, the root qi gathers backwards, the blood congeals in the lower abdomen, the yang qi retreats downwards, heat returns to the inner thighs, and with the yin, causing the body to become unfeeling; this is what causes a corpse to stumble. One should pierce the Ji Men, the Ju Que.<br/>
<br/>
《Qian Jin Fang》says: Yin Bai, Da Dun, are the causes of death and paralysis where the person is unaware, the pulse remains regular.<br/>
<br/>
Zhong Ji, Pu San, are the causes of confusion, death and paralysis, and pain.<br/>
<br/>
Jin Men, is the cause of violent death and paralysis.<a id="trans-59p" href="#orig-59p" class="marker">[59p]</a> Within the inner courtyard, the treatment involved prolonged pressure on the limbs and extremities, specifically the hands and feet, to induce stagnation. This resulted in fever, pain in the shins, abdominal distension, and skin pain.<br/>
<br/>
The deceased, without pulse or other signs, had exhausted both yin and yang. Heat was applied with a heated iron and smoothing board, directed at the lower abdomen, and also treatments were administered for fever.<br/>
<br/>
Needles were inserted at intervals for approximately one hundred breaths, and also at the *ren* (person) acupoint, known as “Ghost’s Hall.”  *Zou Hou Fang* states: Furthermore, treatments were administered for fever.<br/>
<br/>
*Medical Synopsis* says: The flow of vital energy was disrupted, taking the life force. Located at the *qiu ze* (curved channel) above, needles were inserted one-third of the way, first replenishing and then releasing the energy; at *yin bai* (hidden white) one-third of the way, first replenishing and then releasing the energy, replenishing resulted in release; the smoothing board was then applied to the cheeks below the sides.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding “Ghost Strike,” the *shigou* (branch ditch) acupoint was treated, first replenishing and then releasing the energy, replenishing resulted in release; the *sancili* (three miles) acupoint was replenished and then released the energy, releasing the energy five breaths.  If the energy did not arrive, the number of insertions was not inquired about, but when the energy arrived, it was withdrawn and not re-inserted.<br/>
<br/>
*Standard Classics of Medical Diagnosis* states: For those who were unconscious with a lesion above the eyes, seven burns were applied to the second and fifth vertebrae, followed by a burning of a fire-stick, approximately the size of a half-date stone.<a id="trans-60p" href="#orig-60p" class="marker">[60p]</a> A Case<br/>
<br/>
《Jū Mén Shì Qīn》 states: If a man is afflicted with phlegm obstructing the vital orifices, he does not know how to open them, the teeth are tight, and all medicines cannot descend. Dai Ren inquired of the patient: “Did you ever have saliva dripping from your mouth?” He replied, “Yes.” Dai Ren first administered a decoction of *Pungency* and *Quillwort*, administering a paste of ground melon rind into the mouth. The saliva did not descend, and then he took the shell of *Long Clam*, ground it, removed the sharp edges, wrapped it in paper, and administered it into the right nasal orifice. It descended into the pharynx with a sound, and he administered it into the left orifice as well, and it did the same. Dai Ren said, “It can be treated.” After a long time, the saliva ceased to flow, and he then administered a money’s worth of *Orpiment* into the nose. Suddenly, he lay on his side, facing upwards, as if he felt pain, and then he vomited several quintals of phlegm, and he recovered. *Orpiment* is not usually used, because his illness is serious, and nothing else could move it. However, if there was no melon rind, it could not be used; it should be used with news.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a> Danxi said: Brother Zheng is nearly sixty years old and a recipient of maintained support. In the midst of the long summer, he suffered from constipation and urinary issues. Suddenly one evening, he climbed to the latrine, spreading his hands and opening his eyes but without sight, urine flowed, sweat fell like rain, his throat felt like a saw, his breathing was very faint, his pulse was large but without a pattern, and he had no discernible location. It was extremely alarming. I immediately ordered him to take prepared ginseng paste, and first stimulated the Qihai acupuncture point with needles, about the size of a little finger, until eighty breaths. After that, the right hand regained movement; after three more breaths, his lips moved slightly, and the ginseng paste was also prepared. Then I gave him a cup, and after midnight, he finished two cups, his eyes regained sight, and after two *jin* (approximately 2000 grams) he was able to speak and request porridge; after five *jin* (approximately 5000 grams) the diarrhea ceased, and after ten *jin* (approximately 10000 grams) he was completely recovered.<br/>
<br/>
*医宗必读* (Medical Compendium) states: Lady Hu Fang suddenly suffered a stroke, treated with a medicine for wind-stroke. It was ineffective, and then he examined me. Her left wrist was stiff and difficult to move, her right wrist was loose and slippery, stemming from a deficiency of vital energy, and further aggravated by eating while angry. Initially, I used medicine to regulate Qi and clear the channels, and she excreted several black stools. I then administered four courses of a formula with six herbs and ginger juice, which stopped the movement. Subsequently, I used five *qian* (approximately 50 grams) of prepared ginseng, three *qian* (approximately 30 grams) of astragalus, chiang cao, and partially dried chuanxiong (licorice root), two *qian* (approximately 20 grams) of茯苓 (white fungus) and *guishin* (ginger-infused honey), adjusting the formula, and after two months, she was completely recovered. This case is classified as “false emptiness” and also involves a patient with a disorder of the stomach.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a> The magistrate Zhang Tai-geng summoned Liang Lang, on the sixth day of the third month of the Bing year, between the sixth and seventh hours, and found him unable to move, not knowing the cause. Upon the arrival of the next hour, he was still not roused. This was due to excessive cold and dampness. Charcoal powder was blown into his nostrils, but he did not sneeze. The entire household was alarmed and fearful. I took charcoal powder, drew fresh water to wash it, and then used sandalwood to burn it, allowing the fragrant smoke to fill the room to clear his passages. Only after the sixth hour did he recover. He drank a decoction of ten flavors of Xiang Nu (a medicinal herb) and felt at ease. This was a case of a person afflicted with a deficiency caused by heat.<br/>
<br/>
Lady Yan Hui-quan, wife of the official, had previously suffered from pain in her chest and abdomen. The next day, she suddenly lost her ability to move, with reversed circulation in her hands and feet. At the time, a physician administered a pill made of beeswax, and she immediately took it. I examined her; all six of her pulse points were sunken, with a slight movement of her orifices, indicating that she had a full stomach, a blockage of yin and yang, and a disruption of ascending and descending movements, hence the sunken pulse and the movement of her orifices alone. I took dried ginger, prepared with Chen Pi (dried orange peel), Sha Ren (prepared radix aconiti), and salt, and boiled the mixture, using my finger to probe and expel what she had ingested, discovering that she had eaten five or six bowls of food. Once all six pulse points were visible, she was cured. She took a remedy of four great physicians, adding wood fragrance and black seed, and treated her for more than ten days. This was a case of a person afflicted with a deficiency caused by heat, compounded by an imbalance of the body’s humors.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></div>

　　《内经》曰：邪气盛则实，正气夺则虚。夫经之所谓邪者，风寒暑湿燥火，有余之淫邪尔，非若世俗所谓鬼神之妖怪也。病有心虚惊惕，如醉如痴，如有邪鬼所附；或阳明内实，以致登高而歌，弃衣而走，皆痰火之所为，实非鬼妖邪祟之所迷也。古虽有禁咒一科，及龙树咒法之治，皆移精变气之术，但可解疑释惑，以使心神之归正尔，何邪祟之可祛哉！　　丹溪曰：俗云冲恶者，谓冲斥邪恶鬼祟而病也。如病此者，未有不因气血先亏而致者。气血者，心之神也。神既衰乏，邪因而入，理或有之。血气两虚，痰塞心胸，妨碍升降，不得运行，以致十二官各失其职，视听言动，皆为虚妄，以邪治之，其人必死。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a><br/>

　　经云：暴病卒死，皆属于火。注云：火性速疾故也。然初治之药，不寒而温，不降而升，甚者　治也。俗有中风、中气、中食、中寒、中暑、中湿、中恶之别，但见卒然仆倒，昏不知人，或痰涎壅塞，咽喉作声，或口眼喎斜，手足瘫痪，或半身不遂，或六脉沉伏，或指下浮盛者，并可用麻油、姜汁、竹沥，调苏合香丸。如口噤，抉开灌之，或用三生饮一两，加人参一两，煎成入竹沥二三杯，姜汁少许。<a id="orig-44p" href="#trans-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a><br/>
如抉不开，不可进药，急以生半夏为末，吹入鼻中，或用细辛、皂角、菖蒲为末，吹入得嚏则苏。此可以验其受病深浅，则知其可治不可治。若口开手撒遗尿者，虚极而阳暴脱也，速用大料参、芪接补之，及脐下大艾灸之。　　痰涎壅盛者，宜吐之，急救稀涎散：猪牙皂角，肥实不蛀者四挺，去黑皮；晋矾光明者一两，各为细末研匀，轻者五分，重者三字，温水调灌下。又碧霞散：拣上色精好石绿研筛，水飞再研，取二三钱，同冰片三四豆许研匀，以生薄荷汁合温酒调服之。二药不大呕吐，但微微令涎自口角流出，自苏。<br/>
　　旧说口开心绝，手撒脾绝，眼合肝绝，遗尿肾绝，声如鼾肺绝，皆为不治之证。然五证不全见者，速服参芪膏，灸脐下，亦有得生者。　　若中人发直吐清沫，摇头上撺，面赤如妆，汗缀如珠，或头面赤黑，眼闭口开，气喘遗尿，皆不可治。　　诸中，或未苏或已苏，或初病或久病，或吐出紫红色者死。<a id="orig-45p" href="#trans-45p" class="marker">[45p]</a><br/>

　　死治者如人死厥，不醒人事，中风不语，或感鬼神之祟，或遇山魈之侵，一时卒倒，不醒人事是也。此等病是邪气中之，痰迷心窍也。怪病多起于痰，不必惊惶，治其痰而病自愈。然而邪之所凑，其气必虚，用祛痰之药，加入于补正之中，则病去如扫，死者重生。方用白朮五钱，人参、茯苓、半夏、天南星各三钱，白芥子一钱，生附子五分，生姜一大块捣汁，水半酒半，共二碗，煎八分，服。外用皂角刺为末。入研皂角刺时，先用纸一张，湿透封住同在之人鼻孔，然后研为细末。取一匙于鹅翎管，吹入病人鼻孔内，必取喷嚏，以前药灌之立醒，必吐出痰水半盆或一盆，如胶如汤之类，或黄黑青红之色，人自然困倦欲睡，不可惊他，任他自睡。醒来，用人参、半夏、白薇各一钱，白朮五钱，茯苓、白芥子各三钱，陈皮、甘草各五分，水煎服，一剂痊愈。此死治之一法也。<a id="orig-47p" href="#trans-47p" class="marker">[47p]</a><br/>
盖人之中邪，必由元气之虚，邪遂乘虚而入，故用人参以助其正气，而以半夏、白芥子以祛邪与痰，天南星尤能人心而祛邪，用附子猛烈之将，单刀直入，邪自惊退，故一下口而邪即外越上涌出矣。然邪出之后，当纯补胃气，故又不用祛痰之剂，而竟用健脾补胃之品也。更有死证治法，如尸厥之证，亦是气虚，当用人参一两，白朮、半夏、茯苓各五钱，菖蒲一钱，陈皮五分治之。虽同是中邪，然前证是阳邪，此乃遇阴邪也。阳邪者日间遇之，阴邪者夜间遇之也。后方虽亦用人参以补正，而终不用南星之类，直入其心中也。<a id="orig-48p" href="#trans-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a><br/>
如不能语言，亦用皂角末吹之。倘前二证俱遗尿手撒则多不能救，否则皆一剂回生也。以上二证，皆死治之法也。触类旁通，头头是道。大约治邪之法，二方足以包括，再看病之轻重，用药之多寡，则得之矣。　　人卒然见鬼卒倒，或在神庙之内，或在棺椁之旁，偶遇尸气，感中阴邪鬼魅，不省人事者，以瓜蒂散吐之，必然吐痰如涌泉，倾盆而出，鬼若远走则已。吐后仍见鬼者，痰未净也，又用前瓜蒂吐之，以不见鬼为度。后用白朮一两，茯苓五钱，白薇、神曲、炮姜各一钱，陈皮五分，水煎服。此法可治贫穷之人。<a id="orig-49p" href="#trans-49p" class="marker">[49p]</a><br/>

*   Flying Corpse Ghosts and Evil Spirits<br/>
<br/>
Those afflicted with *shi-chuan* and evil spirits are, in essence, among the five corpses, and are also those afflicted by various ghosts and evil spirits. Their manifestations comprise thirty-six to ninety-nine different types. They cause a general feeling of cold, heat, and dampness, induce stillness and silence, leaving the sufferer unaware of their suffering and unable to find relief anywhere, accumulating over years and months, eventually leading to stagnation and ultimately death. After death, they continue to influence the spirits of others, and eventually lead to the destruction of the family lineage. Those experiencing such symptoms should seek immediate treatment.<br/>
<br/>
All cases of severe abdominal pain, when treated with numerous hot medicinal preparations entering the abdomen, remain still and silent, but benefit those with a rapid breath; this is the *shi-chuan* illness, and should be treated first by administering one liter of licorice juice, and when the symptoms subside, by taking a full dose of瞿-Mai (a medicinal decoction), which will cause a bowel movement, alleviate the hardened symptoms, and resolve the hardened remains of food, and the pain and irregular menstruation experienced by women.<a id="trans-1p" href="#orig-1p" class="marker">[1p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Ghosts Strike<br/>
<br/>
The illness of Ghosts Striking manifests as a sudden onset, progressing without gradual development, ultimately attacking the human body like a stabbing, causing severe, agonizing pain in the chest, flanks, and abdomen that cannot be suppressed by pressing, sometimes resulting in vomiting blood, or bleeding from the nose and mouth, or bleeding internally. It is known as Ghosts Striking.<br/>

Sudden Discord is immediately equivalent to being struck by evil spirits. It is similar to Ghosts Striking and Sudden Death, and both are treated by drawing out and utilizing the excess.<br/>

Being Struck by Evil<br/>
<br/>
The patient experiences a sudden swelling and distention of the abdomen, with ineffective vomiting, resembling a severe, dry fever. This is what is commonly referred to as being struck by evil. It arises from a deficient spirit and a mind filled with fear, leading to an attack by evil spirits, which may attach themselves, causing a silent, vacant state, uttering delusional words, insulting and cursing, revealing secrets, disregarding criticism, speaking of fortune and misfortune, and ultimately, at the time of its occurrence, the hair remains intact, while others observe a person’s sudden change of mind, knowing the cause, climbing to dangerous heights, behaving as if walking on level ground, or weeping and groaning, unwilling to see others, exhibiting a state of intoxication or madness, with a multitude of symptoms, but treated with remedies and practices commonly employed.<a id="trans-2p" href="#orig-2p" class="marker">[2p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Five Corpses<br/>
<br/>
The Flying Corpse: It begins with no discernible origin, gradually developing until it reaches a state of complete stillness. Its appearance is characterized by pain in the abdomen, labored breathing, and distension. The Stopped Corpse: It halts in the muscles and blood vessels of the human body; upon contact, it immediately develops, causing pain in the abdomen, labored breathing, and distension, attacking the flank and heart. After recovery, it relapses. The Submerged Corpse: When it manifests, it causes pain in the abdomen, distension, and labored breathing. Even after rest, a heavy, corrupt influence remains within the organs of the human body, causing discomfort everywhere. The Wind-Swept Corpse: It moves within the limbs, circulating the meridians; its appearance is cold and erratic, moving back and forth, silent and without pain. When struck by wind, it manifests. The Hidden Corpse: Its illness hides within the five internal organs, accumulating over many years without being removed, leaving the body without obvious ailment. When it manifests, it causes pain in the abdomen, distension, and labored breathing. Furthermore, there are those with corpse symptoms that develop, in which case the corpse symptoms within the five internal organs become manifest, accompanied by external evil spirits that flow into the body, causing chills, fever, and dampness, or causing lumps to rise, or limbs to contract and pull at the waist and back, or making the body heavy and difficult to move, with a confused mind, constantly feeling disorientation, with changes in every joint, resulting in great harm. After many years and months, it gradually becomes stagnant, eventually leading to death. After death, it is easily transferred to another person, and even to the extinction of a family line, hence it is called corpse symptoms. All are treated with the use of the poison ivy plant, grinding several斛 into a paste and boiling until thick, taking the juice and drinking it three times a day, when recovering.<a id="trans-3p" href="#orig-3p" class="marker">[3p]</a></div>

　　　　　邪祟叙论<br/>
<br/>
　　《内经》曰：邪气盛则实，正气夺则虚。夫经之所谓邪者，风寒暑湿燥火，有余之淫邪尔，非若世俗所谓鬼神之妖怪也。病有心虚惊惕，如醉如痴，如有邪鬼所附；或阳明内实，以致登高而歌，弃衣而走，皆痰火之所为，实非鬼妖邪祟之所迷也。古虽有禁咒一科，及龙树咒法之治，皆移精变气之术，但可解疑释惑，以使心神之归正尔，何邪祟之可祛哉！　　丹溪曰：俗云冲恶者，谓冲斥邪恶鬼祟而病也。如病此者，未有不因气血先亏而致者。气血者，心之神也。神既衰乏，邪因而入，理或有之。血气两虚，痰塞心胸，妨碍升降，不得运行，以致十二官各失其职，视听言动，皆为虚妄，以邪治之，其人必死。<a id="orig-4p" href="#trans-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></div>

An Account of Malign Spirits<br/>
<br/>
《Internal Classic》states: When malefic airs and energies prevail, it manifests as congestion; when righteous energy dominates, it manifests as emptiness. The “malefic” referred to in this classic encompasses wind-cold, summer heat, dampness, and dryness, as well as the unrestrained influence of fire. This is not akin to the “ghosts and demons” commonly perceived by the vulgar. When a patient experiences a hollow heart, anxiety, and a state of vigilance, such as one in a drunken or stupefied state, resembling the attachment of a malignant spirit; or when the yang energy within the body becomes congested, leading to climbing and singing, discarding clothing and running about, these are all manifestations of fire-phlegm, not the delusion of malignant spirits.<br/>
<br/>
Danxi states: What is commonly called “chong evil” refers to the act of forcefully expelling malignant spirits and, in doing so, contracting the illness. Those afflicted with this condition have never been without first experiencing a depletion of their vital energy and blood. Vital energy and blood are the essence of the heart’s spirit. When this spirit weakens, malignant energies enter, and reason may be disturbed. If the blood and vital energy are both deficient, leading to phlegm obstructing the heart and chest, hindering the ascent and descent, and preventing proper circulation, the twelve organs each lose their function, resulting in distorted vision, hearing, speech, movement, all becoming illusory, and attempting to treat this with malignant spirits will inevitably lead to death.<a id="trans-4p" href="#orig-4p" class="marker">[4p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Illness originates from the heart.<br/>
<br/>
All secluded places in valleys and hidden retreats harbor spirits and demons, foxes and beasts, and even the chickens and dogs of the human world can become demonic. Even if they bewitch people, they merely resemble those with deficient vital energy and weakened righteous energy. Weakened righteous energy is equivalent to a heart afflicted by evil, and an evil-afflicted heart leads to false visions, false hearing, false speech, and false movement; all of this is simply evil. Only when evil perceives evil, it exists. A virtuous person, without illness, cannot be seen; it is truly remarkable. Only when the heart is completely pure, will all evil spirits avoid it; what cause is there for suspicion of demonic influences?<a id="trans-5p" href="#orig-5p" class="marker">[5p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Forbidden incantations, drug administration, and simultaneous treatment.<br/>
<br/>
In treating evil spirits and ailments, one should dispel suspicion through the cessation of incantations, and drug administration must carefully examine the reality and lightness of phlegm, heat, and cold, and adjust the treatment accordingly, thus achieving a rapid cure. If only relying on witchcraft without using drugs, the illness cannot be removed, and there is no remedy. If only using drugs without witchcraft to dispel suspicion, the cure will be slow. Therefore, simultaneous internal and external treatment is effective, which is the reason for the establishment of the incantations.<br/>
<br/>
Pulse Observation<br/>
<br/>
Sudden looseness and sudden tightness of the pulse, sometimes large and sometimes small, sometimes quick and sometimes slow; all are indicative of evil pulses. A tight, rapid pulse indicates a fleeing corpse, and a slippery pulse indicates a ghost’s attack.<br/>
<br/>
Diagnosis and Treatment with the String Instrument [Ming Wang Ken Tang]<br/>
<br/>
The symptoms of severe evil are caused by offenses against improper air, resulting in sudden reversal of coldness in the limbs, the skin covered with small bumps, a dark complexion on the face, a loss of mental focus, sometimes uttering incorrect words or nonsense, the teeth tight and the mouth sealed, or the head spinning and falling over, unconscious of one’s surroundings. This is the case of sudden collapse, misalignment of organs, fleeing corpses, and ghostly attacks. Those who die are mourned, and inquiries are made about the deceased, often visiting temples and tombs, and many cases are found in this manner. One administers the Accordant Essence Pill and administers it with a liquid, and after a slight recovery, one prescribes the Accordant Air and Stomach Pill for circulation. This is named the Accordant Air and Stomach Pill.<a id="trans-6p" href="#orig-6p" class="marker">[6p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Stone Chamber Secret Texts [Chen Shitishi]<br/>
<br/>
A sudden illness requires immediate treatment, and delay is unacceptable. For example, when a person is possessed by evil, it is due to phlegm. The remedy consists of fifteen grains of ginseng, fifteen grains of white atractylos, fifteen grains of prepared radix Bupleurum, and a small amount of soapwood powder; fifteen grains of dried orange peel. These are simmered in eight ounces of water. The efficacy of this prescription lies in the soapwood powder’s ability to open the pores and draw the herbs directly into the meridian channels, completely dispelling the phlegm and its confusion, allowing evil to cease.<br/>
<br/>
Return-to-Life Decoction [Zhongjing, and following] Treats those who die from evil spirits disturbing the vital essence. Two portions of ephedra, each two taels. Seventy taels of apricot kernels, with their skins removed. One hundred and seventy of them. One tael of charred licorice root. The three ingredients are simmered in eight catties of water, reducing the liquid to three catties, straining it, and then administering it to the patient by mouth. This prescription is effective for all cases of illness caused by evil spirits disturbing the vital essence.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a prescription: A bundle of chives, twenty-seven black dates, half a pint of fragrant pepper, all ground together. The three ingredients are simmered in a斛 (a large measure, approximately 20 liters) of water. The liquid is reduced to three catties, strained, and then the patient is instructed to comb their hair while drinking it three times. Those that float are alive; those that sink are dead.

Initially, take the dosage like grains of millet, gradually increasing to one nine, until it reaches the size of small beans, and not larger. If the medicine causes confusion, drink a wood-defensive mugwort decoction and it will be calmed. If one wishes to dispel poisonous drugs, eat rotten, boiled fat pork. For long-standing fevers that cause swelling and drooping death, take one pill, and it will vomit the illness; the fever mother also diminishes. For fevers that have lodged and accumulated, take one pill, and drink it down with liquid. For those who die from a cold with a sunken heart, open the mouth, and drink it down with liquid, using a knife to measure and administer.

《Danxi Xinfa》 states: For conditions of deficiency and phlegm, there resembles the intrusion of evil spirits.  Blood essence is the spirit of the body; when the spirit is weakened and deficient, evil spirits enter. The principle may already have it. If both blood essence and qi are deficient, phlegm occupies the middle burner, obstructing ascents and descents, preventing proper function, resulting in the dysfunction of all twelve organs, causing blindness, deafness, speechlessness, and movement to become illusory. Treating such a condition with evil spirits inevitably leads to death. A young boy, during a hot month, overworked himself and drank freely of plum juice, also experienced three or four severe shocks, claiming to see and hear illusions. His pulse was weak and hollow, with a heavy sound on both hands. I said: This is due to a deficiency of heat, the heavy sound indicates shock, and the plum juice stagnates at the middle burner.  I replenished the deficiency with clear heat, relieved the stagnation of phlegm, and the illness was cured. I then prescribed ginseng, atractylodes, chuanxiong, pinellia, poria, shaogui, and licorice, boiling them in a concentrated decoction and adding ginger juice from bamboo, for ten days without effect. Everyone blamed my medicine for being ineffective. I examined his pulse, finding that his deficiency had not recovered, and the phlegm had not subsided, so I ordered him to take front-rank (medicine) ginger juice, and after ten days, he recovered.<a id="trans-33p" href="#orig-33p" class="marker">[33p]</a></div>

Heatstroke and collapse: quickly assist the patient in a cool place, it is absolutely forbidden to use cold water, instead, use cloths and garments dampened with hot soup to iron the navel and the Conception Well, then continue to pour soup over the cloth, allowing it to thoroughly warm the navel and abdomen, and then gradually awaken the patient. If there is no soup immediately available, scoop hot earth onto the navel, and use a large quantity as best, and if it becomes cold, replace it with warm earth.

Death and Collapse<br/>
<br/>
Bian Que, in *Ju Hou Fang*, considered death and collapse similar, and employed a combination of methods in their treatment. Once dead, fresh ginger root was pounded and its juice poured in, immediately halting the illness. Death, collapse, rising fever, stroke, and heatstroke illnesses, all should be treated by expelling them. Zhong Jing said: When rising fever desires to release it, one must produce a great sweating, therefore the *Fanhun Tang* used Ma Huang (Ephedra), Gui Zhi (Cinnamon Twig), to clear the spirit. The *Qinghun Tang* used Jing Jie (Greater Periwinkle) and other remedies to clear the spirit. And all cases of collapse used Soap Root, *Han Xia* (Indian Pentagram Root) to clear the nose, *Liujiu* (Scutellaria) and Arsenic to clear the mouth and remove phlegm, all to open the upper portion and allow external evils to circulate. Heatstroke avoided cold water, fearing it would constrict the meridians, and this was the intention. Mountain dwellers treating those who had suffered from death and collapse would cauterize the navel with hot iron; Soap Root powder was blown into the nostrils; or juice of chives was poured into the ear canals.<a id="trans-42p" href="#orig-42p" class="marker">[42p]</a></div>

<div class="interlaced-block translation">
  <div class="interlaced-content">《本事方》 says: It is said that those afflicted with illness stemming from imbalances in the vital energy, though not explicitly recorded in the texts, often manifest as symptoms resembling a stroke. Specifically, excessive joy damaging the Yang, excessive anger damaging the Yin, sorrow leading to a loss of direction, and an excess of vital energy resulting in a condition of ‘厥’ (joint inversion), frequently cause this ailment. The symptoms include excessive salivation, tightness of the jaw, and paralysis, and if treated improperly, they lead to death. In the year of Yuan You, the year of the Geng Wu, my mother, Lady Shi, personally experienced this misfortune, and to this day, she regrets it. Lady Shi was naturally weak in vital energy and blood, and due to the loss of her son, she was consumed by grief and worry. Suddenly, she suffered a vital energy collapse, her jaw tightened, and she produced excessive salivation. The local physician immediately administered a stroke remedy, and she died within a single night. Because of this, I still harbor deep regret, and whenever I encounter this type of illness, I immediately administer Su He Xiang Wan (a medicine containing camphor) to revive her, and then adjust her treatment according to her fluctuating cold and heat, with no case remaining untreatable.<br/>
<br/>
Vital illnesses arise when the vital energy does not return to its proper channel, resulting in ‘气中’ (vital energy in the body), manifesting like a stroke, causing collapse, unconsciousness, a tight jaw, and lacking phlegm. It is crucial not to use wind-dampening medications or treatments that open the channels and loosen the flesh, etc. Initially, one should administer ginger juice decoction to soothe the vital energy; then, use Su He Xiang Wan (a medicine containing camphor) and Seven Air Decoction with Stone Xiang (a medicinal herb) to redirect the vital energy. Subsequently, use Zhi Zhong Tang (a medicinal formula) with wood fragrance to harmonize the vital energy, allowing it to return to its proper course. If this fails, the vital energy becomes inverted and manifests as a different syndrome.<a id="trans-43p" href="#orig-43p" class="marker">[43p]</a></div>

It is recorded that sudden deaths from severe illnesses are all attributed to fire. It is noted that fire possesses a rapid and swift nature. However, in initial treatment, the medicine is neither cold nor descending, nor is it rising. This is particularly true for severe cases. Commonly, distinctions are made between sudden strokes, disrupted vital energy, food-related issues, chills, heatstroke, dampness, and evil influences. When a person suddenly collapses, loses consciousness, or exhibits symptoms such as thick phlegm and congestion in the throat, a distorted mouth and eyes, paralysis of the limbs, inability to move one side of the body, sunken and elevated pulse, or swollen fingers, these can all be treated with sesame oil, ginger juice, and bamboo sap. For instances of speechless lips, the mouth is opened and irrigated, or three portions of “San Ren Drink” (three portions of San Ren Drink) are prepared with two portions of ginseng, simmered and then poured into two or three cups of ginger juice.<a id="trans-44p" href="#orig-44p" class="marker">[44p]</a></div>

This can be used to ascertain the depth of the illness; knowing this, one can determine whether it is curable or not. If, with the mouth open, one scatters the residue of urine, this indicates extreme deficiency and excessive yang, so quickly use a mixture of large grains and astragalus to replenish, and also cauterize the area below the navel.<br/>
<br/>
If the patient suffers from copious phlegm and thick sputum, it is advisable to induce vomiting; urgently prepare a diluted sputum-dissolving mixture: using pig teeth, tallow, and solid, un-eaten pieces, grind four handfuls, removing the black skin; also use two or three *jin* (a unit of weight) of cinnabar powder, grinding them uniformly, with a small dose of five *wen* (a unit of weight) and a large dose of three *zi* (a unit of weight), dissolving them in warm water and administering them orally. Furthermore, the *Bixia San* (碧霞散) – select good green stone powder, sift it, then re-grind it with water, taking two or three *qian* (a unit of weight), mixing them with three or four *dou* (a unit of measure) of fresh peppermint, grinding them uniformly, and administering them mixed with warm wine. When the two medicines do not cause excessive vomiting, but merely allow a small amount of saliva to flow from the corners of the mouth, the patient will awaken.<br/>
<br/>
Formerly, it was said that an open mouth signified the cessation of the spleen, scattering urine signified the cessation of the liver, closing the eyes signified the cessation of the liver, scattering urine signified the cessation of the kidneys, and a snoring sound signified the cessation of the lungs; these were all incurable conditions. However, when these five conditions are not entirely present, quickly administer a mixture of grains, astragalus, and lard, cauterize the area below the navel, and one may still find the patient awakens.<br/>

When afflicted by wind-borne illness, the six pulses are deeply embedded and dormant, and there are also pulses that follow the flow of vital energy downwards, manifesting as excessive prominence. A floating and sluggish pulse indicates good fortune, a firm and rapid pulse indicates serious illness and misfortune. A floating and sluggish pulse indicates cold, a firm and expansive pulse indicates heat, and if not addressed properly, it will lead to a state of weakness. A floating and agitated pulse indicates dampness, a floating and expansive pulse indicates wind, and a floating and numerous pulse without heat also indicates wind. A small, numerous, floating, and tight pulse, and a slow and sluggish pulse are all manifestations of imbalances within the vital energy. Furthermore, when dealing with wind, one should greet the patient, and when dealing with vital energy, one should attend to the mouth. A large and expansive pulse indicates fire, and a slippery pulse indicates phlegm. Those pulses that are floating and slippery, sinking and slippery, and small and weak, are all manifestations of weakness and phlegm, and one must carefully observe the time of year, the climate, and the patient’s habits of waking and sleeping, and combine these observations with visible symptoms to determine the primary diagnosis and administer appropriate treatment.<a id="trans-46p" href="#orig-46p" class="marker">[46p]</a></div>

<br/>
A fatal illness resulted in death, such that the person ceased to be aware of their surroundings, unable to speak, sometimes afflicted by the influence of ghosts and spirits, or invaded by mountain demons, ultimately collapsing and remaining unconscious. This type of illness stemmed from the obstruction of vital energy, akin to the confusion of phlegm within the heart. Such strange illnesses often originated from phlegm and did not require alarm or panic; their treatment focused on eliminating the phlegm, and the illness would naturally recover. However, when evil forces gathered, their energy was inherently deficient. Utilizing herbs to dispel phlegm and incorporate them into remedies for restoring vital energy, the illness would depart as if swept away. The deceased would be reborn. Specifically, one should take white atractylodes (Bai Zhu) five chi (approximately 18.75 grams), ginseng,茯苓 (Fu Ling), danpi (Huang Qin), Tian Nan Xing (Cyperus rotundus) each three chi (approximately 56.25 grams), white pecelia (Bai Jie Zi) one chi (approximately 18.75 grams), fresh Sichuan root (Sheng Fu Zi) five fen (approximately 0.6 grams), fresh ginger a large piece pounded for juice, water mixed with wine in a ratio of one to one, totaling two bowls, simmered for eight portions, and consumed. Externally, soap cashews (Zao Jiao) were ground into a powder and applied. When administering the soap cashew powder, one first used a piece of paper, wetting and sealing it to cover the nostrils of the person receiving the treatment, then ground it into a fine powder. A spoonful was taken with a goose feather tube and blown into the patient’s nostrils, inevitably inducing a sneeze, and then the medicine was poured in, immediately reviving the person, who would vomit phlegm and water, ranging from half to a full basin, of a viscous or liquid consistency, and in colors such as yellow, black, green, or red. The person would naturally feel drowsy and inclined to sleep, and it was not to be alarmed. Allowing them to sleep naturally. Upon waking, one should take ginseng, danpi, white atractylodes, and white atractylodes, each one chi, white atractylodes five chi, fu ling, white pecelia, each three chi,陈皮 (Chan Pi - Citrus grandis), and 甘草 (Gan Cao - Glycyrrhiza glabra) each five fen, and simmered for consumption in one dose, which would completely cure the illness.

  <div class="interlaced-content">To cure sicknesses of the vital energy, one must first address the deficiency of that energy itself. The evil then enters by exploiting this emptiness. Therefore, ginseng is used to strengthen the vital energy, while danxia, baijiezi, and tiannanxing are used to expel evil and phlegm. Tiannanxing is particularly effective at dispelling evil by penetrating the heart. Using the intense heat of puzi, a single incision is made, and the evil is startled and driven out, causing it to immediately expel upwards. However, after the evil has departed, one must replenish the stomach’s vital energy, so no agents to remove phlegm are used, but instead, products to strengthen the spleen and stomach are employed. Furthermore, there is a method of treating death-like symptoms, such as those of paralysis, which is also caused by deficiency of vital energy. One uses ginseng one ounce, baijue, danxia, and fuling each five chi, changpu one chi, and chenpi five fen to treat it. Although these are all instances of sickness of the vital energy, the former are instances of yang evil, while this is an instance of encountering yin evil. Yang evil is encountered during the day, while yin evil is encountered at night. After the symptoms have subsided, one still uses ginseng to replenish the vital energy, but does not use tiannanxing or similar herbs, instead directly entering the heart.<a id="trans-48p" href="#orig-48p" class="marker">[48p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Three Objects Prepared in a Hurry<br/>
<br/>
Large Yellow, Dried Ginger, Sichuan Buttonseed (stripped of their skins, points, hearts, and roots), each one two ounces. The right ingredients must be exceptionally fresh. First, grind the Large Yellow and Dried Ginger into a powder. Grind the Sichuan Buttonseed within its core, then combine and pound with a thousand mortars. Mix with honey to form pellets, storing them in a vessel. This medicine treats sudden deaths from ailments of the heart and abdomen. For those who offend the stomach and cause fullness, pain like a thorn piercing the heart, shortness of breath with constricted mouth, and death before recovery, administer three to four pellets of this medicine mixed with hot, bitter wine, swallowing them with each dose. Do not administer more than this. Hold the head up and pour it down the throat, immediately administer a dose. If it does not work, repeat with three pellets, pressing them into the abdomen and inducing vomiting to bring up the contents, thereby curing the illness. If the mouth is constricted, one must chew and swallow the pellets.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, this formula resolves all heat poisons threatening death, inducing immediate recovery upon ingestion.<br/>
<br/>
Half Summer Poison (Powdered), Vinegar one liter, half cooked and thoroughly dried, four ounces; Red Cinnamon, stripped of its bark, half ounce; White Peony (Psoralea Corylifolia), stripped of its root, half ounce; Sweet Flag (Asarum heterotropum), White Peony (Psoralea Corylifolia), each one ounce. Grind all ingredients into a powder, using ginger juice to form a paste into pellets the size of a litchi fruit. Take fifty pellets with each dose, swallowing them with hot water. I often carried this medicine with me on summer journeys, guarding against sudden illnesses. My servant and I each took one dose daily, with no heat-related illnesses, a remarkable effect, though not always experienced.<a id="trans-53p" href="#orig-53p" class="marker">[53p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Attached is a remedy for internal chills, characterized by a stifled mouth, stiff limbs, loss of speech, and inability to speak. Formerly, a warrior stationed at a border outpost, while exposed to a heavy snowfall outside his mountain tent, suddenly collapsed. He was then administered this medicine in two doses, and subsequently recovered.<br/>
<br/>
Large Sichuan Root (Da Fu Zi), pulverized and with the peel and umbilical portion removed; Ginseng; Dried Ginger, pulverized; Licorice Root, scorched; and Bai Zhu (White Job’s Tears), all divided into equal portions.<br/>
<br/>
The remedy is taken as a powder, with each dose consisting of four *qian* (small measures), to be dissolved in a cupful and a half of water. It is to be simmered until reduced to seven parts, then strained, and taken on an empty stomach. If the mouth is stifled, one should administer the liquid by pouring it into the mouth.<br/>
<br/>
This is a single formula.<br/>
<br/>
For those suffering from internal heat and death, it is forbidden to use cold substances, as cold will cause death. One should wrap a piece of *qiu* grass around the patient’s navel, causing three or two to drown within it, warming it. It can also be used with hot mud and *qiu* grass; or by placing a clay pot at the bottom of a cart or wheelbarrow to warm the patient. The goal is to cause drowning. It must be made to flow away. This is what is meant by being stranded on the road and having no remedy; one must make the patient drown. If the remedy is immediately available, it can be administered to the patient. It must not be applied to a clay pot or wheelbarrow, lest this substance be cold. Once the *huo ren* (internal heat) is present in the summer months, it can be obtained from hot mud, used to warm the clay pot, and also used.

《Jū Mén Shì Qīn》 states: If a man is afflicted with phlegm obstructing the vital orifices, he does not know how to open them, the teeth are tight, and all medicines cannot descend. Dai Ren inquired of the patient: “Did you ever have saliva dripping from your mouth?” He replied, “Yes.” Dai Ren first administered a decoction of *Pungency* and *Quillwort*, administering a paste of ground melon rind into the mouth. The saliva did not descend, and then he took the shell of *Long Clam*, ground it, removed the sharp edges, wrapped it in paper, and administered it into the right nasal orifice. It descended into the pharynx with a sound, and he administered it into the left orifice as well, and it did the same. Dai Ren said, “It can be treated.” After a long time, the saliva ceased to flow, and he then administered a money’s worth of *Orpiment* into the nose. Suddenly, he lay on his side, facing upwards, as if he felt pain, and then he vomited several quintals of phlegm, and he recovered. *Orpiment* is not usually used, because his illness is serious, and nothing else could move it. However, if there was no melon rind, it could not be used; it should be used with news.<a id="trans-61p" href="#orig-61p" class="marker">[61p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">Danxi said: Brother Zheng is nearly sixty years old and a recipient of maintained support. In the midst of the long summer, he suffered from constipation and urinary issues. Suddenly one evening, he climbed to the latrine, spreading his hands and opening his eyes but without sight, urine flowed, sweat fell like rain, his throat felt like a saw, his breathing was very faint, his pulse was large but without a pattern, and he had no discernible location. It was extremely alarming. I immediately ordered him to take prepared ginseng paste, and first stimulated the Qihai acupuncture point with needles, about the size of a little finger, until eighty breaths. After that, the right hand regained movement; after three more breaths, his lips moved slightly, and the ginseng paste was also prepared. Then I gave him a cup, and after midnight, he finished two cups, his eyes regained sight, and after two *jin* (approximately 2000 grams) he was able to speak and request porridge; after five *jin* (approximately 5000 grams) the diarrhea ceased, and after ten *jin* (approximately 10000 grams) he was completely recovered.<br/>
<br/>
*医宗必读* (Medical Compendium) states: Lady Hu Fang suddenly suffered a stroke, treated with a medicine for wind-stroke. It was ineffective, and then he examined me. Her left wrist was stiff and difficult to move, her right wrist was loose and slippery, stemming from a deficiency of vital energy, and further aggravated by eating while angry. Initially, I used medicine to regulate Qi and clear the channels, and she excreted several black stools. I then administered four courses of a formula with six herbs and ginger juice, which stopped the movement. Subsequently, I used five *qian* (approximately 50 grams) of prepared ginseng, three *qian* (approximately 30 grams) of astragalus, chiang cao, and partially dried chuanxiong (licorice root), two *qian* (approximately 20 grams) of茯苓 (white fungus) and *guishin* (ginger-infused honey), adjusting the formula, and after two months, she was completely recovered. This case is classified as “false emptiness” and also involves a patient with a disorder of the stomach.<a id="trans-62p" href="#orig-62p" class="marker">[62p]</a></div>

  <div class="interlaced-content">The magistrate Zhang Tai-geng summoned Liang Lang, on the sixth day of the third month of the Bing year, between the sixth and seventh hours, and found him unable to move, not knowing the cause. Upon the arrival of the next hour, he was still not roused. This was due to excessive cold and dampness. Charcoal powder was blown into his nostrils, but he did not sneeze. The entire household was alarmed and fearful. I took charcoal powder, drew fresh water to wash it, and then used sandalwood to burn it, allowing the fragrant smoke to fill the room to clear his passages. Only after the sixth hour did he recover. He drank a decoction of ten flavors of Xiang Nu (a medicinal herb) and felt at ease. This was a case of a person afflicted with a deficiency caused by heat.<br/>
<br/>
Lady Yan Hui-quan, wife of the official, had previously suffered from pain in her chest and abdomen. The next day, she suddenly lost her ability to move, with reversed circulation in her hands and feet. At the time, a physician administered a pill made of beeswax, and she immediately took it. I examined her; all six of her pulse points were sunken, with a slight movement of her orifices, indicating that she had a full stomach, a blockage of yin and yang, and a disruption of ascending and descending movements, hence the sunken pulse and the movement of her orifices alone. I took dried ginger, prepared with Chen Pi (dried orange peel), Sha Ren (prepared radix aconiti), and salt, and boiled the mixture, using my finger to probe and expel what she had ingested, discovering that she had eaten five or six bowls of food. Once all six pulse points were visible, she was cured. She took a remedy of four great physicians, adding wood fragrance and black seed, and treated her for more than ten days. This was a case of a person afflicted with a deficiency caused by heat, compounded by an imbalance of the body’s humors.<a id="trans-63p" href="#orig-63p" class="marker">[63p]</a></div>
